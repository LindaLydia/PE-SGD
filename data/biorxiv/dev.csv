"Analysis of lung alveolar type 2 (AT2) progenitor stem cells has highlighted fundamental mechanisms that direct their differentiation into alveolar type 1 cells (AT1s) in lung repair and disease. However, microRNA (miRNA) mediated post-transcriptional mechanisms which govern this nexus remain understudied. We show here that the let-7 miRNA family serves a homeostatic role in governance of AT2 quiescence, specifically by preventing the uncontrolled accumulation of AT2 transitional cells and by promoting AT1 differentiation. Using mice and organoid models, we demonstrate genetic ablation of let-7a1/let-7f1/let-7d cluster (let-7afd) in AT2 cells prevents AT1 differentiation and results in accumulation of AT2 transitional cells in progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Integration of AGO2-eCLIP with RNA-sequencing from AT2 cells uncovered the induction of direct targets of let-7 in an oncogene feed-forward regulatory network including BACH1/EZH2/MYC which drives an aberrant fibrotic cascade. Additional analyses using CUT&RUN-sequencing revealed an epigenetic role of let-7 in induction of chromatin histone acetylation and methylation and maladaptive AT2 cell reprogramming. This study identifies let-7 as a key gatekeeper of post-transcriptional and epigenetic chromatin signals to prevent AT2-driven pulmonary fibrosis."
"The formation of the germ layers and antero-posterior (AP) axial patterning are interlinked milestones of embryogenesis. Gastruloids, in vitro models from aggregated embryonic stem cells (ESCs), permit the study and deconstruction of these events. Gastruloids are successfully generated from ESCs of variable pluripotent states, but it remains unknown how the initial conditions influence cell type composition and to what degree resulting variations in spatial patterning can converge onto an elongated body axis. To address this, we comparatively study aggregates from varying proportions of primed and naive ESCs. Despite differences in AP symmetry-breaking dynamics and distinct trajectories toward either anterior mesodermal or neuro-ectodermal fates, all conditions produce elongated gastruloids. Furthermore, timed modulation of Activin/Nodal signaling in aggregates equalizes AP polarization modes and mixing of initial ESC pluripotent states generates gastruloids with enhanced tissue type diversity. This work therefore uncovers a previously unappreciated developmental flexibility underlying mammalian AP axial patterning."
"MotivationReconstructing unobserved ancestral states of a phylogenetic tree provides insight into the history of evolving systems and is one of the fundamental problems in phylogenetics. For a fixed phylogenetic tree, the most parsimonious ancestral reconstruction - a solution to the small parsimony problem - can be efficiently found using the dynamic programming algorithms of Fitch-Hartigan and Sankoff. Ancestral reconstruction is important in many applications including inferring the routes of metastases in cancer, deriving the transmission history of viruses, determining the direction of cellular differentiation in organismal development, and detecting recombination and horizontal gene transfer in phylogenetic networks. However, most of these applications impose additional global constraints on the reconstructed ancestral states, which break the local structure required in the recurrences of Fitch-Hartigan and Sankoff.

ResultsWe introduce an alternative, polyhedral approach to ancestral reconstruction problems using the tree labeling polytope, a geometric object whose vertices represent the feasible ancestral labelings of a tree. This framework yields a polynomial-time linear programming algorithm for the small parsimony problem. More importantly, the tree labeling polytope facilitates the incorporation of additional constraints that arise in modern ancestral reconstruction problems. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by deriving mixed-integer programming algorithms with a small number of integer variables and strong linear relaxations for three such problems: the parsimonious migration history problem, the softwired small parsimony problem on phylogenetic networks, and the convex recoloring problem on trees. Our algorithms outperform existing state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. For instance, our algorithm scales to trace routes of cancer metastases in trees with thousands of leaves, enabling the analysis of large trees generated by recent single-cell sequencing technologies. On a mouse model of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, the tree labeling polytope allows us to infer simpler migration histories compared to previous results.

"Smoothened (SMO), a member of the G Protein-Coupled Receptor superfamily, mediates Hedgehog signaling and is linked to cancer and birth defects. SMO responds to accessible cholesterol in the ciliary membrane, translocating it via a longitudinal tunnel to its extracellular domain. Reaching a complete mechanistic understanding of the cholesterol translocation process would help in the development of cancer therapies. Experimental data suggests two modes of translocation to support entry of cholesterol from outer and inner membrane leaflets, but the exact mechanism of translocation remains unclear. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations ([~]2 millisecond simulations) and biochemical assays of SMO mutants, we assess the energetic feasibilities of the two modes. We show that the highest energetic barrier for cholesterol translocation from the outer leaflet is lower than that from the inner leaflet. Mutagenesis experiments and complementary simulations of SMO mutants validate the role of critical amino acid residues along the translocation pathways. Our data suggests that cholesterol can take either pathway to enter SMO, thus explaining experimental observations in literature. Thus, our results illuminate the energetics and provide a first molecular description of cholesterol translocation in SMO."
"As the fastest-growing form of land use, urbanization drives profound environmental change that reshapes biodiversity. Studies in urban ecology and evolution often rely on generic indices of urbanization to characterize biodiversity patterns along urban-rural gradients. However, these indices do not permit explicit tests of causal hypotheses by which urbanization mediates ecological and evolutionary processes. Here, we show how a graphical causal modeling framework with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can be used to design clear conceptual models to better evaluate mechanistic hypotheses about the effects of urbanization on biodiversity. We introduce the basic structure of DAGs and illustrate their value, first with simulated data and then with a case study on coat color variation in eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) along an urbanization gradient in Syracuse, New York, USA. We show how univariate statistical models with generic urbanization predictors are difficult to interpret and can lead to misleading conclusions about mechanisms in urban ecology and evolution. In contrast, DAGs make causal assumptions transparent and can point to specific processes driving biodiversity patterns. When applied to our case study, analyses informed by a DAG revealed a surprising finding: although squirrel melanism was more prevalent in urban than rural populations, the prevalence of melanism was constrained by components of environmental change common to cities, namely roads, forest loss, and predator activity, in contrast to expectations. Managing biodiversity in an increasingly urbanized world will require a mechanistic understanding of how urbanization impacts biodiversity patterns; graphical causal models can provide a powerful approach to do so."
"Aneuploidy is one of the most common mechanisms of adaptation to environmental selection in vegetatively growing cells. However, it is still unclear what advantages aneuploidy provides over other types of genomic alterations. In this study, we aimed to determine if beneficial aneuploidy phenotypes are driven primarily by combinatorial expression changes of multiple genes using budding yeast as a model system. To determine the impact of complex aneuploidy on cellular fitness and resistance to a variety of drug treatments, we generated yeast collections with nearly every possible combination of two chromosome gains or losses. In addition, we genetically dissected aneuploid chromosomes using partial deletions to identify chromosomal regions that contribute to aneuploidy-driven drug resistance. Strong resistance phenotypes consistently came from combinations of chromosomes or chromosomal regions. We identified up to five regions on a single chromosome that contribute to resistance to a single drug treatment. Finally, we found that the strongest aneuploidy phenotypes came from synergistic effects between copy number changes of different chromosomes or chromosomal regions. These results provide insights into how combining subtle gene expression changes across the genome impacts aneuploidy phenotypes."
"Membrane-bound pyrophosphatases are integral membrane proteins that catalyze the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate into orthophosphate, while simultaneously facilitating the pumping of protons and/or sodium ions. Since mPPases are absent in humans but play a critical role in the life cycle of protist parasite, they represent promising therapeutic targets. We successfully expressed the Plasmodium falciparum type 1 mPPase in the baculovirus/insect cell expression system and purified the protein, yielding 0.3 mg per liter cell culture. Various detergents were tested for solubilization, with the protein remaining active under all selected detergents. n-dodecyl-{beta}-D-maltoside combined with cholesteryl hemisuccinate provided the highest solubility (88%). Finally, the PfPPase-VP1 was assayed against a set of fourteen antimalarial drugs, along with seven Thermotoga maritima mPPase inhibitors and fourteen compounds of unknown activity against mPPases. Only three compounds, all pyrazolo[1,5- a]pyrimidine-based TmPPase inhibitors, retained micromolar IC50 activity against PfPPase-VP1. The expression and purification of the PfPPase-VP1 will allow to conduct structural studies as well as to develop target-based screens, two steps necessary for the development of inhibitors to combat parasite disease."
"Generative design of functional RNAs presents revolutionary opportunities for diverse RNA-based biotechnologies and biomedical applications. To this end, RNA inverse folding is a promising strategy for generatively designing new RNA sequences that can fold into desired topological structures. However, three-dimensional (3D) RNA inverse folding remains highly challenging due to limited availability of experimentally derived 3D structural data and unique characteristics of RNA 3D structures. In this study, we propose RIdiffusion, a hyperbolic denoising diffusion generative RNA inverse folding model, for 3D RNA design tasks. By embedding geometric features of RNA 3D structures and topological properties into hyperbolic space, RIdiffusion efficiently recovers the distribution of nucleotides for targeted RNA 3D structures based on limited training samples using a discrete diffusion model. We perform extensive evaluations on RIdiffusion using different datasets and strict data-splitting strategies and the results demonstrate that RIdiffusion consistently outperforms baseline generative models for RNA inverse folding. This study introduces RIdiffusion as a powerful tool for the generative design of functional RNAs, even in structure-data-scarce scenarios. By leveraging geometric deep learning, RIdiffusion enhances performance and holds promise for diverse downstream applications."
"Henipaviruses, a genus within the Paramyxoviridae family, include the highly virulent Nipah and Hendra viruses that cause reoccurring outbreaks of deadly disease 1. Recent discoveries of several new Paramyxoviridae species, including the zoonotic Langya virus 2, have revealed much higher antigenic diversity than currently characterized and prompted the reorganization of these viruses into the Henipavirus and Parahenipavirus genera 3. Here, to explore the limits of structural and antigenic variation in both genera, collectively referred to here as HNVs, we constructed an expanded, antigenically diverse panel of HNV fusion and attachment glycoproteins from 56 unique HNV strains that better reflects global HNV diversity. We expressed and purified the fusion protein ectodomains and the attachment protein head domains and characterized their biochemical, biophysical and structural properties. We performed immunization experiments in mice leading to the elicitation of antibodies reactive to multiple HNV fusion proteins. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of diverse fusion proteins elucidated molecular determinants of differential pre-fusion state metastability and higher order contacts. A crystal structure of the Gamak virus attachment head domain revealed an additional domain added to the conserved 6-bladed, {beta}-propeller fold. Taken together, these studies expand the known structural and antigenic limits of the HNVs, reveal new cross-reactive epitopes within both genera and provide foundational data for the development of broadly reactive countermeasures."
"The present study examined the contribution of the koniocellular retino-geniculate visual pathway to the electrocortical amplification of threat cues in human visual cortex using an aversive conditioning task. The task involved tritan stimuli, which are thought to convey visual information through S-cone signals that project to regions along the koniocellular pathway (tritan condition) and achromatic stimuli that preferentially activate luminance channels (luminance condition). Steady-state visual evoked potential (ssVEPs) responses to the conditioned threat (CS+) and safety cues (CS-) in each condition were analyzed using a non-parametric Bayesian bootstrapped approach. Results showed that the tritan and luminance conditions exhibited greater ssVEP responses to the CS+ compared to the CS-stimuli in occipital sensors early into the trial (0 ms - 1000 ms; logBF10 > 2, decisive support). In addition to these early conditioning effects, a late conditioning effect was observed (1500 ms - 2500 ms) in the tritan condition that emerged in bilateral anterior sensors (logBF10 > 2). To further examine the tritan contribution to aversive learning, transitive Bayes factors were computed to compare the magnitude of the conditioning effects across conditions. Transitive Bayes factors showed that the early conditioning effect was larger in the luminance condition compared to the tritan condition (logBF10 > 2). Furthermore, the late conditioning effect remained larger in the tritan condition compared to the luminance condition (logBF10 > 2). Our findings suggest that both the koniocellular visual pathway and luminance channels play a role in the electrocortical amplification of threat signals in human visual cortex."
"Prostate cancer (PCa) is an androgen receptor (AR) driven, high-incidence disease significantly contributing to cancer mortality. PCa is in need of better risk stratification at diagnosis and treatment outcomes in patients at high risk of metastasis. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an AR-dependent process. However, the impact of the UPR transducer IRE1 on AR-dependent biology and treatment resistance has not been defined. We use diverse pre-clinical models of stress response to describe IRE1 activity impact on multiple disease stages and demonstrate its involvement with poor prognosis (RB1 loss), and cell lineage determination (club phenotypes). Integrating clinical transcriptomic datasets, we chart IRE1 activity throughout PCa evolution by developing a PCa-specific, IRE1 activity gene set (IRE1_18) reflecting both tumoral and micro-environmental niches. IRE1_18 can determine tumoral identity, inform androgen deprivation treatment suitability, prognosticate localised and metastatic disease independently from AR activity, and guide IRE1 modulation as a novel combination therapeutic.

"Immune checkpoint inhibitors can elicit deep and durable immune responses although most cancer patients fail to experience long-term remission. There is consensus that tumor hypoxia coordinates a multitude of underlying resistance mechanisms that contribute to treatment failure. Here we show that the clinical-stage hypoxia-activated prodrug tarloxotinib lowers tumor hypoxia 8-fold in the EGFR-dependent MB49 syngeneic tumor model, attracting a effector CD8+ T cell infiltrate into an oxygen enriched tumor microenvironment, leading to potentiation of checkpoint inhibitor activity. Various methodologies, including CD8+ T cell depletion and exogenous T cell priming confirmed that tarloxotinib has a positive impact on the function of activated CD8+ T cells. Whilst anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 treatments all benefited from the remodeled tumor microenvironment, anti-PD-L1 was most responsive to tarloxotinib coadministration, providing a 100% complete response rate and >360% improvement in tumor growth delay (day 19; p<0.0001). This robust interaction was associated with MB49 tumor enrichment of CD8+ T cell infiltrate from 8% to 43% of the total CD45+ population. To further understand these promising observations, comparative RNA transcript analysis of 770 cancer/immune related genes in naive and tarloxotinib treated tumors highlighted the strong induction of gene clusters related to co-stimulatory signaling, cytokine/chemokine signaling, interferon signaling, immune cell adhesion/migration, antigen presentation and the lymphoid/myeloid compartments. Serum protein analysis confirmed upregulation of a mixture of cytokines/chemokines, including IL-6, IL-12p40, IFN{gamma}, G-CSF and MIP-1{beta}, amongst others. The source of this broad immunogenic response was identified as toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) dependent, with the positive interaction between anti-PD-L1 and tarloxotinib blocked in MyD88 or TLR9 knockout mice. Further, the observed therapeutic interaction was still evident in MC38 and EG7.OVA syngeneic tumor models, both refractory to tarloxotinib by virtue of EGFR-signal independence. Consistent with the clinical experience of minimal systemic toxicities related to EGFR inhibition (e.g. diarrhea), mouse body weight loss was minimal across all in vivo studies and histopathology screening for evidence of lung fibrosis proved negative. Tarloxotinib therefore represents a systemically administered small molecule with an established clinical safety profile that is capable of activating TLR9 signaling within tumors whilst remodeling the microenvironment to facilitate efficacy of checkpoint blockade.

What is already known on this topicSolid tumor resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is orchestrated through a diverse collection of hypoxia-driven mechanisms. In preclinical models modifying the tumor microenvironment (TME) to lessen hypoxia typically improves responses to ICI.

What this study addsTarloxotinib is a hypoxia-activated prodrug (HAP) of an irreversible EGFR/HER2 TKI that profoundly remodels the TME, both eliminating tumor hypoxia and elevating cytokine/chemokine production via a TLR9 dependent effect. Together, this results in a marked tumor influx of activated CD8+ T cells (and other TILs), that results in major improvements in the efficacy of ICIs, particularly anti-PD-L1.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyTarloxotinib is the first example of a tumor-targeted small molecule TLR9 stimulant that restores ICI sensitivity in a range of syngeneic tumor models. Phase I/II data has demonstrated that tarloxotinib is well tolerated, with few EGFR-dependent (on-target) side-effects, reflecting minimization of normal tissue exposure with the tumor-targeted HAP approach. Importantly, it also optimizes tumor selective exposure, offering a compelling clinical rationale for evaluation of this combination in cancer patients experiencing ICI relapse or resistance."
"Regular expressions (regex) (Kleene 1951) have been an important tool for finding patterns in biological codes for decades (Hodgman 2000 and citations therein), and unlike fuzzy-finding approaches, do not result in approximate matches. The performance of regular expressions can be slow, however, especially when searching for matching patterns in large files. grepq is a Rust application that quickly filters FASTQ files by matching sequences to a set of regular expressions. grepq is designed with a focus on performance and scalability, is easy to install and easy to use, enabling users to quickly filter large FASTQ files, to enumerate named and unnamed variants, to update the order in which patterns are matched against sequences through in-built tune and summarise commands, and optionally, to output a SQLite file for further sequence analysis. grepq is open-source and available on GitHub and Crates.io."
"Memory retrieval is notoriously variable. Various neurocognitive states have been theorized to affect retrieval success from moment to moment, but the presence and catalysts of these states in the human brain remain largely understudied. Building on previous work, we studied how recent memory experiences (i.e. novelty vs. familiarity) and their corresponding neural activity prepare the brain to reactivate memories. Our data uncover a pronounced neural bias, whereby regions representing episodic information fail to reactivate memories following recent experiences of novelty. Drawing on computational models, we hypothesized that novelty-evoked activity in cholinergic nuclei underlie this bias. The data revealed an unexpected alternative mediator of memory reactivation in response to recent novelty, namely recent dopaminergic nuclei activity. By identifying dopamine as a potential mediator of retrieval variability, our results challenge existing models and open new avenues for investigating how neuromodulatory states dynamically shape memory accessibility."
"To understand the mechaisnm behind high respond (HighR) compared to low respond (LowR) to resistnace training (RT) and whey protein supplementation (20g/day), we analysied vastus laterails muscle biopsies from a total of 50 participants. Utilising the MRI muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) data, we defined responders as those who had hypertrophy exceeding the 1.7% method error. Quadriceps CSA in the lower responder (LowR) (n=25, mean age 69{+/-}5 years) and HighR (n=25, mean age 67{+/-}4 years) increased from 53.6 {+/-} 12.1 cm2 to 55.4 {+/-} 12.8 cm2 after 10 weeks of RET (3.3 {+/-} 1.7%, P < 0.001) and increased the absolute CSA in the higher responders (HighR) from 53.7 {+/-} 12.5 cm2 to 59.2 {+/-} 13.6 cm2 (10.3 {+/-} 2.0%, P < 0.001). Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis before and after RT. We performed untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics to investigate changes in muscle metabolic regulation. The partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) yielded the best results using the polar extracts, achieving a 75% average correct classification rate for predicting HighR and LowR. There was no signifncat differences in metabolomic profile at the basline. Our findings revealed several metabolic pathways, including branched-chain amino acid catabolism, tryptophan metabolism (indole and kynurenine pathways), the TCA cycle, gut-derived metabolites, carnitine shuttle metabolism as prominent pathways disrupted in LowR. We provide new insights and has the potential to identify and enhance interventions targeting muscle metabolism, ultimately improving muscle mass and strength to reduce the risk of sarcopenia and frailty in older age."
"Extensive peripheral nerve injuries often lead to the loss of neurological function due to slow regeneration and limited recovery over large gaps. Current clinical interventions, such as nerve guidance conduits (NGCs), face challenges in creating biomimetic microenvironments that effectively support nerve repair. In this study, we designed the GrooveNeuroTube, composed of a hyaluronic acid methacrylate and gelatin methacrylate (HAMA-GelMA) hydrogel, incorporating active agents (growth factors and antibacterial agent) encapsulated within an NGC conduit made of 3D-printed PCL grid fibers. This bioengineered conduit demonstrated high cytocompatibility (>90%) and extended degradability (over 60 days). In vitro studies showed that GrooveNeuroTube significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuronal cells, 3D bioprinted at the far ends of the conduit to imitate a proximal nerve injury as a novel ex vivo model. A long-term culture of up to 60 days was employed to better mimic in vivo conditions. We then used this model to test the effects of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) stimulation on neural tissue development and integration. Analysis revealed that neurite length was significantly greater in cells exposed to PEMF stimulation, with more elongated neurites (38%). After 60 days in culture, GrooveNeuroTube showed cell migration reaching 7.2 mm, representing a 32% increase compared to the GF-only group and a 105% increase compared to the no-growth-factor condition. These results confirm that the GrooveNeuroTube system can effectively support sustained neural cell migration and maturation over extended periods, proving a new technology for testing peripheral nerve injury ex vivo.

"Light can affect the movement of microorganisms. These responses can drive collective behaviours like photoaccumulation and photodispersion, which play a key role in broader biological functions like photosynthesis. Our understanding of these emergent phenomena is severely limited by difficulties in obtaining data needed to establish accurate models that can serve as a basis for multi-scale analyses. Here, we address this issue by developing an integrated experimental and computational platform to collect large temporal imaging datasets that allow for the inference of  digital twins -- mathematically precise computational models that accurately mirror the behavior of individual microorganisms -- and show that they can replicate the light response of diverse microorganisms in silico. We show that a generalised phenomenological model of movement can be effectively parameterised from experimental data to capture key behavioural traits of two commonly studied photo-responsive microorganisms (Euglena gracilis and Volvox aureus) and demonstrate our models ability to accurate reproduce patterns of movement for individuals and populations in response to dynamic and spatially varying light patterns. This work takes steps towards the automated phenotyping of multi-scale behaviours in biology and complements high-throughput genome sequencing efforts by allowing for more comprehensive and quantitative genotype-to-phenotype mappings. It also unlocks new opportunities for the design of spatial control algorithms to guide collective microorganism behaviour."
"In this study, we present Talk2Biomodels (T2B), an open-source1, user-friendly, large language model-based agentic AI platform designed to democratize access to computational models of biological interactions and promote the FAIRification (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) of these models. T2B enables users to explore and analyse mathematical models of biological systems using natural language. It eschews the traditional graphical user interface (GUI) and minimally adaptable workflow in favour of a modern agentic framework to provide a dynamic and immersive experience to explore mathematical models of biological interactions through conversations in natural language. T2B supports models encoded in the open-source community format Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and is integrated with the BioModels database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), enabling seamless exploration, simulation, and analysis of curated systems biology models. Use cases in precision medicine, epidemiology, and emergent systems properties of biological networks are presented to demonstrate how experts and non-experts in computational biology can benefit from T2B."
"Our memories do not simply keep time -- they warp it, bending the past to fit the structure of our experiences. For example, people tend to remember items as occurring farther apart in time if they spanned a change in context, or  event boundary, compared to the same context. While these distortions can sacrifice precise timing, they may serve to help separate temporally adjacent memories. However, the neural bases of this phenomenon are poorly understood. Here, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; n = 32) with eye-tracking (n = 28) to test whether the dopaminergic system, known to influence encoding and time perception, predicts time dilation between adjacent events in memory. Participants encoded item sequences while listening to tones that mostly repeated over time, forming a stable auditory context, but occasionally switched, creating an event boundary. We found that boundaries predicted greater retrospective estimates of time between item pairs. Critically, tone switches significantly activated the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key midbrain dopaminergic region, and these responses in turn predicted greater time dilation between item pairs spanning those switches. Boundaries furthermore predicted a momentary increase in blinks. VTA activation also predicted blinking in general, consistent with the idea that blink behavior is a potential marker of dopaminergic activity. On a larger timescale, higher blink rates predicted greater time dilation in memory, but only for boundary-spanning pairs. Together, these findings suggest that dopaminergic processes are sensitive to event structure and may drive temporal distortions that help disjoin memories of distinct events.

SignificanceMeaningful changes in the environment can exaggerate the remembered time between experiences, suggesting a link between temporal distortions and the creation of distinct episodic memories. Here, we combined fMRI and eye-tracking with a paradigm that assessed temporal memory for item pairs encountered within and across task-relevant contexts. We found that contextual changes predicted activation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and momentary increases in blinking, both potential markers of dopaminergic activity. VTA activation and more prolonged periods of blinking across boundaries were also associated with greater time dilation in memory. Our findings extend the relationship between dopamine and time perception to episodic memory, revealing how the ebb and flow of experience might bend memories of time to represent discrete events."
"Classical botany identifies a clear adaxial/abaxial (palisade/spongy) patterning of the mesophyll in leaves of eudicots but suggest that there is no comparable overt pattern within the mesophyll of most grasses. In this paper, we report on an analysis of leaves from across ploidy levels of Triticum species which reveals a patterning of mesophyll cellular architecture that has been maintained during the evolution/selection of wheat. Taking a quantitative approach to the analysis of 2D and 3D images, we show that upper and lower mesophyll cells are larger than the middle mesophyll cells, which are themselves more lobed than the mesophyll cells adjoining the upper and lower epidermis. This mesophyll patterning is superimposed on a gradual increase of cell size with ploidy, suggesting that it is evolutionarily ancient. Taken in the context of data revealing patterning of the rice mesophyll, our data support the hypothesis that grass leaves do display distinct cellular patterning across the adaxial/abaxial axis, the functional significance of which awaits full elucidation."
"AbstractLinker histone H1, the most abundant chromatin protein, condenses chromatin, modulates DNA transactions such as transcription and DNA replication/repair, and participates in differentiation, development and tumorigenesis. While recent studies indicate that nucleosomes are clustered as condensed chromatin domains in higher eukaryotic cells, how histone H1 mechanically condenses chromatin remains unclear. Here, using a combination of direct visualization of single-H1 molecules in living human cells and multiscale molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the majority of H1 behaves like a liquid inside chromatin domains, rather than binding stably to nucleosomes as suggested by the traditional model. H1 functions as a liquid-like ""glue"", mediating dynamic multivalent interactions between nucleosomes within chromatin domains. Consistently, rapid-depletion of H1.2 leads to decondensed chromatin domains both in cells and in silico. Our findings suggest that the H1 ""glue"" condenses chromatin domains while keeping them fluid and accessible, thereby supporting essential DNA transactions."
"In everyday vision, objects in scenes are often poorly or only partially visible, for example because they are occluded or appear in the periphery. Previous studies have shown that the visual system can reconstruct missing object information based on the spatial context in static displays. Real-world vision is dynamic, however, causing the visual appearance of objects (e.g., their size and viewpoint) to change as we move. Importantly, these changes are highly predictable from the 3D structure of the surrounding scene, raising the possibility that the visual cortex dynamically updates object representations using this predictive contextual information. Here, we tested this hypothesis in two fMRI studies (N=65). Experiment 1 showed that visual representations of objects were sharpened when they rotated congruently (rather than incongruently) with the surrounding scene. Moreover, Experiment 2 showed that the updated orientation of the object (as dictated by the surrounding scene) could be decoded from visual cortex activity, even when the object itself was not visible. These findings indicate that predictive processes in the visual cortex follow the geometric structure of the environment, thus providing a mechanism that leverages predictions to aid object perception in dynamic real-world environments."
"Microbial communities in marine ecosystems play a pivotal role in global biogeochemical cycles, with particular relevance in ecologically and industrially significant regions such as the Santos Basin (SB), Brazils largest marine sedimentary basin and a hub for oil and gas exploration. Yet, our capacity of predicting the microbial community structure and function remains limited for marine ecosystems. This study investigated the structure of microbial communities across different depths in the SB, using amplicon sequencing data and quantitative cell counts obtained via flow cytometry. Using a hybrid machine learning framework combining Self-Organizing Maps and Random Forest, we identified five distinct microbial assemblages (named microbial associations) in the SB predicted with 86% accuracy. These associations were primarily driven by temperature, water density, salinity, and nutrients such as phosphate and nitrate. Our findings showed a clear stratification of microbial communities across pelagic zones, with temperature as the main factor driving the structure in epipelagic and mesopelagic layers, while salinity and density exerted greater influence in the deeper bathypelagic communities. Temporal and spatial variations, particularly between 2019 and 2021, in regions influenced by the Cabo Frio upwelling and Rio de la Plata plume, further highlighted the impact of regional and local oceanographic processes on community dynamics. The associations from deeper waters harbored more diverse microbial assemblages, and shallow waters, on the other hand, possess higher absolute abundance of microbial cells, suggesting niche specialization across depths. This study underscores the importance of environmental gradients as well as local oceanographic processes in shaping microbial diversity, providing valuable insights into the ecological dynamics of the SB, which are essential for understanding the potential impacts of human activities, such as oil and gas exploration and production, on these critical marine ecosystems."
"Understanding gut microbiome dynamics gut requires deciphering complex, metabolically driven interactions beyond taxonomic profiles. We present SIMBA, a novel framework that integrates mechanistic metabolic simulations with a graph neural network (GNN) to predict microbial abundances and uncover cross-feeding relationships. By simulating pairwise interactions among gut microbes using metabolic networks, we generate biologically grounded graphs that capture metabolite cross-feeding and functional relationships. Our custom GNN, enhanced with edge-aware attention, is trained through a multi-stage pipeline combining self-supervised learning, simulation-based pretraining, and fine-tuning on real microbial abundance data. SIMBA achieves state-of-the-art performance (Spearman {rho} = 0.85) and enables interpretable insights into keystone taxa and metabolic bottlenecks. This work demonstrates the power of combining metabolic networks with deep learning for precision microbiome analysis."
"Energy metabolism involves a network of biochemical reactions that generate ATP, utilizing substrates such as glucose and oxygen supplied via cerebral blood flow. Energy substrates are metabolized in multiple interrelated pathways that are cell- and organelle-specific. These pathways not only generate energy but are also fundamental to the production of essential biomolecules required for neuronal function and survival. How these complex biochemical processes are distributed over the cortex is integral to understanding the structure and function of the brain. Here, using curated gene sets and whole-brain transcriptomics, we generate maps of five fundamental energy metabolic pathways: glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation and lactate metabolism. We find consistent divergence between primarily energy-producing pathways and anabolic pathways, particularly in unimodal sensory cortices. We then explore the spatial alignment of these maps with multi-scale structural and functional attributes, including metabolic uptake, neurophysiological oscillations, cell type composition, laminar organization and macro-scale connectivity. Finally, we show that metabolic pathways exhibit unique developmental trajectories from the fetal stage to adulthood. The primary energy-producing pathways peak in late childhood, while the anabolic pentose phosphate pathway shows pronounced expression in the fetal stage and declines throughout life. Together, these results highlight the rich biochemical complexity of energy metabolism organization in the brain."
"A deeper understanding of sickle cell disease (SCD) pathophysiology is critical for identifying novel therapeutic targets. A hallmark of SCD is abnormal phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on sickle red blood cells (RBCs), which contributes to anemia, thrombosis, and vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). However, the mechanisms underlying this excessive PS exposure remain unclear. Here, we identify TMEM16F, a Ca2+-activated lipid scramblase, as a key mediator of PS exposure downstream of Ca2+ influx through the mechanosensitive channel PIEZO1 in sickle RBCs. Electrophysiology, imaging and flow cytometry reveal that deoxygenation-induced sickling promotes PIEZO1 activation, triggering Ca2+ entry, TMEM16F activation, and PS exposure. This cascade enhances PS+ microparticle release, thrombin generation, and RBC adhesion to endothelial cells. Notably, partial PIEZO1 inhibition with benzbromarone, an anti-gout drug, suppresses these changes. Our findings thus define a previously unrecognized mechanotransduction pathway in sickle RBCs and propose a unique therapeutic strategy to mitigate hypercoagulability and vaso-occlusion associated with SCD.

Brief SummaryEnhanced PIEZO1 activation in sickle red blood cells promotes TMEM16F scramblase-mediated phosphatidylserine exposure and subsequent sickle cell disease complications. Disrupting this coupling presents a potential therapeutic strategy."
"Phytopathogenic bacteria secrete diverse virulence factors to manipulate host defenses and establish infection. Characterization of the type III secretion system (T3SS)- and HrpL-independent secretome (T3-IS) in Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi (Psv), the causal agent of olive knot disease, identified five secreted LysM-containing proteins (LysM1-LysM5) associated with distinct physiological processes critical for infection. Functional predictions from network analyses suggest that LysM1, LysM2, and LysM4 may participate in type IV pilus-related functions, while LysM3 and LysM5 are likely to possess peptidoglycan hydrolase domains critical for cell division. Supporting these predictions, loss of LysM1 function resulted in impaired twitching and swimming motility, highlighting a role in pilus-mediated movement and early host colonization. In contrast, mutants lacking LysM3 or LysM5 exhibited pronounced filamentation and defective bacterial division, underscoring their essential role in septation, a process crucial for both in planta fitness and tumor formation. Structural modeling and protein stability assays demonstrate that LysM3 interacts with peptidoglycan fragments such as tetra-N-acetylglucosamine and meso-diaminopimelic acid, as well as with zinc ions, through conserved LysM and M23 domains. LysM3 also displayed selective bacteriostatic activity against co-inhabiting Gram-negative bacterial competitors, such as Pantoea agglomerans and Erwinia toletana. Our findings highlight the relevance of LysM proteins in maintaining bacterial integrity, motility, and competitive fitness, which are crucial for successful host infection. This study expands the functional repertoire of LysM-containing proteins and reveals their broader impact on bacterial virulence and adaptation to the plant-associated niche.

Author SummaryPlant pathogenic bacteria secrete a variety of proteins to manipulate host responses and outcompete microbial rivals. In this study, we investigated a group of five secreted proteins with conserved LysM domains produced by the bacterium responsible for olive knot disease, Pseudomonas savastanoi. We found that these proteins fulfill distinct and critical functions during infection. Three are potentially involved in the assembly of type IV pili, structures that help bacteria move and colonize plant tissues, while the other two are related to enzymes that remodel the bacterial cell wall and are essential for proper cell division. Mutants lacking these proteins failed to divide normally and were significantly impaired in their ability to infect olive plants. One of these proteins, LysM3, also exhibited the ability to inhibit other Gram-negative bacteria that coexist with the pathogen in the plant tumor, pointing to a role in microbial competition. These findings shed light on how LysM-containing proteins contribute to both disease progression and bacterial competition and survival in the plant environment. This work paves the way for new insights into bacterial pathogenesis and offers potential strategies for controlling olive knot disease and other plant infections."
"Disease ecology has focused greatly on determining how changes to biodiversity may drive infectious disease risk for humans. Fencing off experimental areas (exclosures) has been a common experimental approach to assess how removing large-bodied hosts may affect disease risk, especially with tick-borne pathogens (TBPs). However, exclosure experiments have found conflicting results based on the experiments scale, with smaller exclosures tending to increase tick densities inside the exclosure and larger exclosures tending to decrease tick densities inside. Previously, we have lacked a unifying theoretical framework able to reconcile the results of exclosure experiments across spatial scales. We present a spatially explicit model of TBP risk incorporating tick dispersal by small competent mammal hosts which can enter the exclosure and by large incompetent mammal hosts excluded from the exclosure. Our model reproduces the scale-dependence and spatial patterning observed in past exclosure experiments while elucidating their causal mechanisms. Specifically, the modeled exclosures produce high densities of infected ticks near their boundaries, with the densities decreasing towards the exclosures center. Empirical results have found lower tick densities at the exclosures edge than its center, a pattern we demonstrate can also be produced if we additionally allow ticks in their free-living questing stage to disperse."
"Whole genome doubling (WGD) is a frequent event in cancer evolution associated with chromosomal instability, metastasis, and poor prognosis. While the genomic consequences of WGD are well documented, the effects of non-genetic alterations that accompany WGD, such as changes to cell and nuclear size, on tetraploid (4N) cancer cell physiology are less understood. Here, we show that cell and nuclear volume do not always scale with DNA content after WGD in cancer cells, resulting in 4N cells that differ in size. We find that small size is associated with enhanced cell fitness, mitotic fidelity, and tumorigenicity in 4N cancer cells and with poor patient survival in WGD-positive human cancers. Overall, these results suggest that cell and nuclear size contribute to the tumorigenic potential of 4N cancer cells and could be an important prognostic marker in human tumors that undergo WGD.

Statement of SignificanceWe report that WGD generates tetraploid cancer cells that vary in size, with larger cells displaying high chromosomal instability and smaller cells exhibiting high fitness and tumorigenicity. Furthermore, WGD status and cancer cell nuclear size in human tumors correlated with patient survival, demonstrating the clinical relevance of this association."
"A key regulatory step in protein synthesis is the initiation of mRNA translation. We developed an efficient, robust, and broadly applicable system for light-induced protein translation to control the production of proteins of interest and study their function. The method is based on the displacement of a single type of antisense morpholino from RNA by the uncaged guanidinium-linked morpholino (GMO)-phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO) chimera upon UV irradiation. The GMO-PMO chimera designed here is cell-permeable and the GMO part can be produced employing a new mercury-free approach compatible with the synthesis on solid support. We demonstrate the function of this novel optochemical approach in live embryos by inducing, at desired times and locations, the expression of proteins that label specific cells, ablate tissue regions, and affect embryonic development. Together, our results demonstrate that the cell-permeable GMO-PMO chimera offers a unique strategy for controlling the function of mRNAs of interest. This method allows for the production of proteins at specific times and positions within live organisms, facilitating numerous applications in biomedical research and therapy."
"BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a critical threat to global health, necessitating innovative strategies to identify druggable targets and develop effective therapies. Traditional approaches often fail to address the rapid evolution of resistance mechanisms, particularly in high-priority pathogens. This study integrates AI-driven gene prioritization with nanotechnology to combat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.

MethodsA dual-axis strategy was made to formulate genetic algorithm selection for gene centrality, conservation, interaction networks that has been effectively used to predict draggability scores for AMR genes (blaNDM-1, mcr-1). Hydroxyapatite-alginate-chitosan nano capsules were synthesized for pH-responsive ciprofloxacin delivery. Molecular docking validated ligand-target compatibility, while dynamic light scattering (DLS) and SEM characterized nanoparticle morphology (100-200 nm). In vitro drug release kinetics were assessed over 48 hours.

ResultsblaNDM-1 showed an (draggability score: 0.92) and mcr-1 (0.89) that have been emerged as top targets with activity against both E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, due to their enzymatic roles in {beta}-lactam and colistin resistance. Uniform nano capsules (150 {+/-} 25 nm) demonstrated sustained ciprofloxacin release (75% cumulative release at 24 h). Docking confirmed stable binding of ciprofloxacin to active sites of target proteins (hydrogen bonds [&le;]2.0 [A]), supporting inhibitory potential.

ConclusionsThese findings indicate computational and experimental approaches to address AMR. The AI-nano therapy pipeline identified high-value targets and validated nanoparticle-based drug delivery, achieving a 6-log reduction in bacterial load in vitro. Future work will focus on in vivo validation and clinical translation."
"BackgroundEndohyphal microbiomes, comprising bacteria and viruses, significantly influence fungal phenotypes, host fitness, and ecological interactions. Endohyphal bacterial symbionts are known to affect fungal pathogenicity, secondary metabolite production, and adaptability, yet many aspects of their diversity and interactions remain uncertain. In contrast, endohyphal viruses, despite their widespread presence, are poorly understood in terms of their diversity, ecological roles, and evolutionary relationships with fungal hosts. These gaps highlight the need for integrative studies to explore the composition, diversity, host associations, and functional roles of both bacterial and viral communities in fungi. This study aimed to (1) characterize the diversity of endohyphal bacterial and viral communities within selected fungal endophytes using genomic and transcriptomic approaches, and (2) test for host specialization through phylogenetic signals and core microbial taxa.

ResultsEndohyphal microbial communities from 19 fungal isolates from eight fungal orders (Amphisphaeriales, Botryosphaeriales, Diaporthales, Glomerellales, Mucorales, Pleosporales, Sordariales, and Xylariales) obtained from Fagus grandifolia leaves were characterized. Bacterial communities exhibited high diversity and significant phylogenetic signals, with core taxa such as Bacillales, Burkholderiales, Enterobacterales, Hyphomicrobiales, and Pseudomonadales, shared across all fungal samples. Specific bacterial taxa displayed potential host specialization, including Moraxellales, Sphingomonadales, and Streptosporangiaceae for Amphisphaeriales fungal samples; Enterobacterales (e.g., Enterobacteraceae), Hyphomicrobiales (e.g., Rhizobiaceae), and Micrococcales for Glomerellales; and Cytophagales for Diaporthales. Viral communities were less diverse, with Bamfordvirae and Heunggongvirae (double-stranded DNA viruses) identified as core taxa in metagenomic data, while metatranscriptomic data revealed no core taxa. Surprisingly, only a few reads of double-stranded RNA mycoviruses were detected.

ConclusionsThe findings suggest a level of host specialization in bacterial communities and a more complex, limited association for viral communities, with dsDNA dominating the endohyphal virome. This study enhances our understanding of fungal-microbe interactions and highlights the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of endohyphal microbiota. Future efforts to expand reference databases and investigate the functional roles of these microbial taxa will further elucidate their contributions to fungal biology, impacts on their plant hosts, and ecosystem processes."
"Interactions between chromosomes forming homologous pairs are known to be widespread in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and present in other organisms. While these trans-homologous interactions affect regulation of gene expression, many details regarding their location, function and mechanisms of action are still unknown. The increased availability of phased Hi-C datasets made it possible to reliably infer such trans-homologous interactions.

We have developed a tool called TransContactHiC to detect trans-homologous chromatin interactions in phased Hi-C data and we used it to re-analyze published in situ Hi-C data for heterozygotic Drosophila melanogaster cells: embryos and a fully differentiated cell line. We further assessed the frequency of cis- and trans-homologous interactions for equally sized genomic bins, and detected triads of genomic elements which exhibit significantly different frequency of trans-homologous interactions compared to the cis-homologous counterpart.

We show that triads of genomic elements exhibiting significantly higher frequency of trans homologous interactions are characterized by their clustering within broader regulatory regions, proximity to DNase-seq peaks and presence of disrupted transcription factor motifs at the affected locus. We also show examples of annotated active cis-regulatory modules which might be affected by these differential trans-homologous interactions. Overall, our results show the functional relevance of the detected triads."
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, often developing in the context of chronic liver disease, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Identifying novel biomarkers with diagnostic and therapeutic potential is essential, particularly those relevant across multiple cancer types. This study integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from healthy and diseased liver tissues, analyzing different cellular lineages to identify genes involved in fibrosis, angiogenesis, immune modulation, and apoptosis regulation. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) clustering, differential gene expression (DEG) analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction were employed to identify genes contributing to tumor progression and metabolic reprogramming. Key genes, including Transmembrane BAX Inhibitor Motif Containing 4 (TMBIM4), Regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (RGS5), CEA Cell Adhesion Molecule 7 (CEACAM7), and Variable Charge X-Linked 2 (VCX2), exhibited significant roles in tumorigenesis and chromosomal stability. VCX2, a cancer/testis antigen, emerged as a potential biomarker and druggable target due to its altered expression among multiple cancers. Structural modeling and molecular docking (MD) of VCX2 identified a high affinity binding pocket, guiding a virtual screening of Peruvian natural products. Luteolin-5-O-glucoside, from Equisetum arvense, was identified as the most promising compound, showing a strong docking score (-7.42 kcal/mol) and favorable binding free energy ({Delta}G_bind = -40.13 kcal/mol). MMGBSA calculations revealed stabilizing hydrogen bonds with PRO91, GLU97, and GLU109, reinforcing its strong binding stability. These findings position VCX2 as a promising target for HCC therapy and suggest Luteolin-5-O-glucoside as a lead compound with high drug-like potential. Further studies should focus on experimental validation, molecular dynamics simulations, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) optimization to advance VCX2-targeted therapies.

"Cryopreservation is a valuable tool for preserving marine genetic diversity and supporting selective breeding in aquaculture. The blue mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) is an important species for the aquaculture industry and a useful model for studying cryopreservation in marine invertebrates. Declining mussel seed availability over the past decade, combined with the growing demand for year-round hatchery production, has increased interest in developing effective cryopreservation methods for gametes and embryos. However, cryopreservation remains challenging, particularly for marine invertebrate oocytes, as it requires balancing cryoprotectant cytotoxicity with sufficient cell protection during freezing and thawing. Moreover, the molecular, structural, and functional changes associated with oocyte cryopreservation in invertebrates are still poorly understood. This study examines the effects of two commonly used cryoprotectants, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylene glycol (EG), on M. galloprovincialis oocytes under a monitored slow freezing (MSF) protocol. Using an integrative analytical approach combining proteomics, functional assessments, and ultrastructural analyses, we provide a comprehensive understanding of cryoprotectant-induced changes. Our findings reveal that cryoprotectants cause significant proteomic alterations, with DMSO having more pronounced effects. These alterations are associated with increased oxidative stress, an insufficient antioxidant response, and disruptions in meiosis restart mechanisms, ultimately delaying larval development. Cryoprotectant-induced oxidative stress may also weaken the oocyte membrane, leading to rupture during the MSF protocol and subsequent fertilisation failure post-thawing. These results provide evidence that EG is less cytotoxic than DMSO and suggest that supplementing cryoprotectants with antioxidants and membrane stabilizers could enhance success rates in the cryopreservation of oocytes from mussels and other marine invertebrate species."
"Structural dynamics are fundamental to protein functions and mutation effects. Current protein deep learning models are predominantly trained on sequence and/or static structure data, which often fail to capture the dynamic nature of proteins directly. To address this, we introduce SeqDance and ESMDance, two protein language models trained on dynamic biophysical properties derived from molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analyses of over 65,100 proteins. SeqDance, trained from scratch, learns both local dynamic interactions and global conformational properties across ordered and disordered proteins. SeqDance predicted dynamic property changes reflect mutation effect on protein folding stability. ESMDance, built upon ESM2 outputs, substantially outperforms ESM2 in zero-shot prediction of mutation effects for designed and viral proteins which lack evolutionary information. Together, SeqDance and ESMDance offer a novel framework for integrating protein dynamics into language models, enabling more generalizable predictions of protein behavior and mutation effect."
"Vision is not instantaneous but evolves over time. However, simultaneously capturing the fine spatial details and the rapid temporal dynamics of visual processing remains a major challenge, resulting in a gap in our understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics. Here, we introduce a forward modeling technique that bridges high-spatial resolution fMRI with high-temporal resolution MEG, enabling us to non-invasively measure different levels of the visual hierarchy in humans and their involvement in visual processing with millisecond precision. Using fMRI, levels of the visual hierarchy were identified by measuring individuals population receptive fields and determining visual field maps. We predicted how much the activity patterns in each visual field map would contribute to brain responses measured with MEG. By comparing these predicted responses with the measured MEG responses, we assessed how much a given visual field map contributed to the measured MEG response, and, most importantly, when. We combined information from all MEG sensors and revealed a cortical processing hierarchy across visual field maps. We validated the method using cross-validations and demonstrated that the model generalized across MEG sensor types, stimulus shapes, and was robust to the number of visual field maps included in the model. We found that the primary visual cortex captured most of the variance in the MEG sensors and did so earlier in time than extrastriate regions. We also report a processing hierarchy across extra-striate visual field maps and clusters. We effectively combined the advantages of two very different neuroimaging techniques, opening avenues for answering research questions that require recordings with high spatiotemporal detail. By bridging traditionally separate areas of research, our approach helps close longstanding gaps in our understanding of brain function.

Author SummaryVision doesnt happen instantaneously, but unfolds over time. While we understand a lot about how the brain processes visual space, understanding how the brain processes information over both space and time is much more challenging. Vision happens incredibly fast, space and time are tightly linked, but current technology is limited in capturing these spatiotemporal dynamics.

Here, we developed a method that combines two non-invasive human brain imaging techniques using computational models: fMRI, which provides high spatial detail, and MEG, which captures millisecond-level timing. We use fMRI to model the detailed layout of the visual system, and predict how this spatial layout responds to specific visual stimuli and compare these predictions with MEG recordings. This allows us to pinpoint not just where visual processing happens, but also when.

Our results reveal a clear processing hierarchy: primary visual cortex responds first and explains most of the MEG signal, while higher-level visual areas activate later. We show that our method works across different stimuli, MEG sensor types, and brain areas, proving its robustness. This approach offers a new way to track how information flows through the living human brain, opening up new possibilities to study vision in both health and disease."
"Phage-induced lysis of bacteria transforms population dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem functioning. Scaling up infected cell fate to ecosystem-scale impacts requires quantitative estimates of viral life history traits, including underlying heterogeneity in the timing, efficiency, and outcome of lytic infections. Here, we apply a nonlinear model of phage-bacteria infection dynamics to infer single-cell heterogeneity of phage-induced lysis from population-scale time series. We evaluate this inference approach in an ecologically relevant system: Syn9, a T4-like cyanophage infecting Synechococcus strain WH8109, a representative of globally abundant marine cyanobacteria. The model infers heterogeneous distributions of latent period and burst size that were subsequently validated using a single-cell assay. We find observed latent period variation exceeds that found in coliphage with holin lysis systems and that burst size variability is largely explained due to latent period variation. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of inferring phage trait heterogeneity from population data in ecologically relevant systems even in the absence of single-cell experiments."
"AmpC {beta}-lactamases (blaAmpC) are one of the important drivers for a high incidence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within ESKAPE pathogens, which are a group of bacteria that are the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections. Investigating the presence and characteristics of the blaAmpC is essential for understanding the molecular mechanism of resistance and developing effective strategies to combat AMR. We have investigated the presence of blaAmpC, distribution on plasmids/chromosomes, copy number, amino acid identities/variabilities, and evolutionary characteristics in ESKAPE pathogens. Our analysis indicates 1790 AmpC enzymes in 4713 completely assembled genomes, subdivided into nine different enzyme groups. AmpC is more common in A. baumannii, followed by P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter spp., but absent in E. faecium and S. aureus. Among the nine AmpC enzyme groups, ACC, ACT, CMH, and MIR are exclusively found in Enterobacter spp., while the largest enzyme group ADC is only present in A. baumannii; PDC and PIB are found only in P. aeruginosa. Phylogenetic analysis revealed significant divergence amongst few enzyme groups and closer evolutionary relationships within others. Functional motif analysis identified conserved catalytic residues across all enzyme groups, except PIB, which demonstrates structural and functional divergence. Because of these variations, PIBs ability to bind cephalosporins decreases while enhancing its activity against carbapenems, hence, we have excluded PIB from further analysis. This is the first detailed report on AmpC in ESKAPE pathogens, which also re-emphasizes the wise use of antibiotics to reduce the rise of AmpC cephalosporins resistance, a significant public health concern.

"Despite advances in immunotherapy, clinical responses remain heterogeneous, underscoring the need to elucidate the gut microbiomes role in modulating therapeutic efficacy. We conducted a large-scale genome-resolved metagenomic analysis of 624 stool samples from 11 cohorts spanning five cancer types from three continents to identify conserved microbial biomarkers of immunotherapy response. Responders (R; n = 362) exhibited enrichment of Blautia species, linked to acetate production from CO2 via the Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway, glycoside hydrolases (GH), and amino acid biosynthesis. Non-responders (NR; n = 262) showed increased oral (e.g. Veillonella parvula, Dialister invisus) and food-derived taxa included opportunistic species e.g. Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella spp., alongside depletion of gut-resident microbes and enriched lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and flagellar assembly pathways. Interestingly, part of NR-associated microbes originated from non-intestinal niches (oral/food), which may correlate with reduced gut microbial load in the large intestine. These findings redefine dietary interventions as dual-edged: while carbon sources such as fiber processed by GH or CO2 processed by WL pathway supports beneficial taxa and immune system, pathogen-free food sourcing is critical to avoid introducing opportunistic microbes. Our work establishes the resident-to-transient microbial ratio as a novel predictive biomarker and positions Blautia as a keystone genus for next-generation probiotics targeting carbon metabolism-immune crosstalk. By integrating taxonomic, functional, and ecological axes, this study provides a roadmap for microbiome-guided precision nutrition to optimize immunotherapy outcomes. While immunotherapy non-responders exhibit gut microbiota enriched with food/oral commensals, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii - shows context-dependent associations, with strain-level variations potentially linked to A blood group antigen N-acetylgalactosamine utilization, highlighting its role as a conditional biomarker and the prognostic value of metagenomics in personalized therapy."
"Bacteria and archaea employ a rudimentary immune system, CRISPR-Cas, to protect against foreign genetic elements such as bacteriophage. CRISPR-Cas systems are found in Bombella apis, a microbe associated with honey bee queens, brood, and royal jelly. Unlike other honey bee microbiome members, B. apis does not colonize the worker bee midgut or hindgut and has therefore been understudied with regards to its importance in the honey bee colony. However, B. apis appears to play beneficial roles in the colony, by protecting developing brood from fungal pathogens and by bolstering their development under nutritional stress. Previously we identified CRISPR-Cas systems as being acquired by B. apis in its transition to bee association, as they are absent in a sister clade. Here we assess the variation and distribution of CRISPR-Cas types across B. apis strains. We found multiple CRISPR-Cas types, some of which have multiple arrays, within the same B. apis genomes and also in the honey bee queen gut metagenomes. We analyzed the spacers between strains to identify the history of mobile element interaction for each B. apis strain. Finally, we predict interactions between viral sequences and CRISPR systems from different honey bee microbiome members. Our analyses show that the B. apis CRISPR-Cas systems are dynamic, that microbes in the same niche have unique spacers which supports the functionality of these CRISPR-Cas systems, and that acquisition of new spacers may be occurring in multiple locations in the genome, allowing for a flexible antiviral arsenal for the microbe.

IMPORTANCEHoney bee worker gut microbes have been implicated in everything from protection from pathogens to breakdown of complex polysaccharides in the diet. However, there are multiple niches within a honey bee colony that host a different group of microbes, including the acetic acid bacterium Bombella apis. B. apis is found in the colony food stores, in association with brood, in worker hypopharyngeal glands, and in the queen digestive tract. The roles that B. apis may serve in these environments are just beginning to be discovered and include production of a potent antifungal that protects developing bees and supplementation of dietary lysine to young larvae, bol-stering their nutrition. Niche specificity in B. apis may be affected by the pressures of bacteriophage and other mobile elements which may target different strains in each specific bee environment. Studying the interplay between B. apis and its mobile genetic elements (MGEs) may help us better understand microbial community dynamics within the colony and the potential ramifications for the honey bee host."
"Numerous studies have shown that metagenomics has opened up a new dimension in reading the contents of archaeological remains as time capsules. Corn mummies are ritual objects made in ancient Egypt by forming human-shaped figures made of cereal grains grown in a mixture of water and earth. We performed metagenomic analyses on samples from a corn mummy dated to the second half of the 3rd century BC. Alongside a number of clearly modern contaminants, we identified organisms that cannot be excluded as being of historical origin. Besides considerable amounts of bacterial sequences belonging to the genera Bacillus, Mesobacillus, Metabacillus, Neobacillus, Niallia, Peribacillus and Paenibacillus, we also found traces of plants, animals, and humans. Sequences assigned to the genus Triticum showed the highest similarity to ancient T. turgidum ssp. dicoccum specimens from Egypt and the southern Levant. The fragments identified as of Lepidopteran origin showed the greatest similarity to the genomes of the Sphingidae. Analysis of the human-derived sequences revealed L3 (mtDNA), E and J (Y chromosome) haplotypes, which are common lineages in Africa today."
"The uterus is central to the establishment, maintenance, and delivery of a healthy pregnancy. Biomechanics is an important contributor to pregnancy success, and alterations to normal uterine biomechanical functions can contribute to an array of obstetric pathologies. Few studies have characterized the passive mechanical properties of the gravid human uterus, and ethical limitations have largely prevented the investigation of mid-gestation periods. To address this key knowledge gap, this study seeks to characterize the structural, compositional, and time-dependent micro-mechanical properties of the nonhuman primate (NHP) uterine layers in nonpregnancy and at three time-points in pregnancy: early 2nd, early 3rd, and late 3rd trimesters. Distinct material and compositional properties were noted across the different tissue layers, with the nonpregnant endometrium and pregnant decidua being the least stiff, most viscous, least diffusible, and most hydrated layers of the NHP uterus. Pregnancy induced notable compositional and structural changes in the decidua and myometrium but had no effect on their micro-mechanical properties. Further comparison to published human data revealed marked similarities across species, with minor differences noted for the perimetrium and nonpregnant endometrium. This work provides insights into the material properties of the NHP uterus and demonstrates the validity of NHPs as a model for studying certain aspects of human uterine biomechanics."
"Archaeal membrane lipids are markedly distinct from those in bacteria and eukaryotes, serving as unique biomarkers for unraveling their ecological and biogeochemical roles. Recent advancements in lipidomics have facilitated detailed cellular-level characterizations of lipid compounds. However, the lack of a comprehensive and dedicated database has severely limited large-scale, high-throughput investigations of archaeal lipids. We present ArchLips, a comprehensive database containing 218,868 in silico molecular structures and tandem mass spectra of 199,248 corresponding archaeal lipids. ArchLips enables the rapid and accurate identification of characterized archaeal lipid compounds from both pure cultures and environmental samples, serving as a transformative tool for enhancing our understanding of archaeal diversity and their ecological and evolutionary significance within global ecosystems."
"Intermediate omics traits, which mediate the effects of genetic variation on phenotypic traits, are increasingly recognised as valuable components of genetic evaluation. In particular, rhizosphere microbiota play a crucial role in plant health and productivity; however, their complex interactions with host genetics remain challenging to model. Although two-step modeling frameworks have been proposed to integrate intermediate omics traits into phenotype prediction, existing approaches do not incorporate nonlinear relationships between different omics layers. To address this, we have proposed a two-step phenotype prediction framework that integrates genomic, rhizosphere microbiome, and metabolome (meta-metabolome) data, while explicitly capturing omicsomics nonlinearities. The first step is to predict meta-metabolome traits from genetic and microbial features, thus effectively isolating them from the environmental noise. In this process, intermediate ""proxy"" omics traits are generated as general biological information to provide robust models. The second step utilises this ""proxy"" to enhance the accuracy of the phenotype prediction. We compared the linear model (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction, BLUP) and the nonlinear model (Random Forest, RF) at each step, as demonstrated through simulations and empirical analysis of a multi-omics soybean dataset in which nonlinear modeling captures intricate omics interactions. Notably, our approach enables phenotype prediction without requiring the original meta-metabolome data used in model training, thereby reducing reliance on costly omics measurements. This framework integrates intermediate omics traits into genomic prediction to improve prediction accuracy and provide solutions for deeper insights into plant-microbiome interactions."
"Variant effect predictors (VEPs) - computational tools that assess the potential impact of genetic variants - have become increasingly vital for clinical variant interpretation. Currently, most VEPs used in variant prioritisation have been trained on datasets of clinically curated or population-derived variants. These datasets, however, disproportionately represent individuals of European descent. We hypothesised that this bias may lead to unequal VEP performance across different populations. To test this, we evaluated the scoring patterns of 52 VEPs for missense variants across 14 ancestry groups. We observe striking disparities: some VEPs predict a markedly higher proportion of damaging variants in underrepresented populations, such as those of Malay descent, compared to individuals of European ancestry. In contrast, VEPs that do not rely on clinical or population data predict more consistent pathogenicity burdens across ancestry groups. Moreover, we could closely link these discrepancies across methods to biases in training data. Our findings underscore the urgent need to adopt tools that minimise ancestry bias to ensure fairer and more accurate variant effect prediction and genetic diagnoses for all populations."
"MotivationDisease models serve as fundamental tools in drug discovery and early-stage drug development. However, these models are not a perfect reflection of human disease, and selecting a suitable model can be challenging. Existing computational approaches for molecular validation of pathophysiological resemblance to human conditions at single-cell resolution remain limited. Although quantitative computational methods exist to inform this selection, they are very limited at the single-cell resolution, which can be critical for model selection. Quantifying the resemblance of disease models to the human condition with single-cell technologies in an explainable, integrative, and generalizable manner remains a significant challenge.

ResultsWe present singIST, a computational method for comparative single-cell transcriptomics analysis between disease models and human conditions. singIST provides explainable quantitative measures on disease model similarity to human condition at both pathway and cell type levels, highlighting the importance of each gene in the latter. These measures account for orthology, cell type presence in the disease model, cell type and gene importance in human condition, and gene changes in the disease model measured as fold change. This is achieved within a unifying framework that controls for the intrinsic complexities of single-cell data. We tested our method using three well-characterized murine models of moderate-to-severe Atopic Dermatitis, demonstrating its ability to recapitulate established biological knowledge while generating novel hypothesis through pathway-level analysis.

Author SummaryIn this study, we set out a method to improve how researchers evaluate disease models - tools that are essential for understanding human illness and developing new treatments. A major limitation of current methods is that they overlook the fine-scale differences between disease models and human conditions at the single-cell level. Yet, many diseases are driven by changes that occur in specific cell types.

To address this, we developed singIST, a method that allows us to compare disease models to human diseases using single-cell gene expression data. What makes singIST unique is its ability to provide clear, interpretable measures of similarity between a disease model and the human condition, specifically at the level of cell types and groups of functionally related genes.

We demonstrated the method using three well-characterized mouse models of atopic dermatitis and showed that singIST could both reflect known disease biology and uncover new insights into disease mechanisms. Further, we developed statistical tests to validate the trained models. Our approach is flexible and broadly applicable, making it a valuable tool for improving the selection and understanding of disease models in biomedical research."
"Predicting repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) effects on whole-brain dynamics in clinical populations is crucial for developing personalized therapies and advancing precision medicine in brain disorders. This study provides the first proof-of-concept demonstrating that the Digital Twin Brain (DTB) can forecast rTMS effects on brain state dynamics in individuals with brain disorders (chronic tinnitus). First, we identified two aberrant brain states that predominantly overlapped with the somatomotor and default mode networks, respectively. Subsequently, we developed DTB for patients and derived regional responses for each brain region, revealing distinct roles of the parieto-occipital and frontal regions. Mechanistically, we examined the biological plausibility using tinnitus-specific risk genes and investigated the multi-scale neurobiological relevance. Clinically, we found that DTB can predict rTMS effects in an independent, longitudinal dataset (all r > 0.78). Particularly, the predictive capacity exhibits a state-specific nature. Overall, this work proposes a novel DTB-based framework for predicting rTMS effects in clinical populations and provides the first empirical evidence supporting its clinical utility. This approach may be generalizable to other brain disorders and neuromodulation techniques, promoting broader advancements in brain health."
"Living things self-regulate in response to various stimuli, including chemicals, light and heat [1]. In engineered biological systems, on-demand activation or repression of transcription underpins the design of genetic programs that control synthesis of useful products [2-9]. Even electrical stimuli can be used to control gene expression, but previous such  electrogenetic approaches have required a combination of exogenous redox mediators and complex regulatory proteins [10,11]. Here we show that transcription can be modulated electrically in a cell-free system through the use of a DNA triplex as a molecular brake, which is opened or closed by means of electrolytic decomposition of water. Our DNA constructs comprise a double-stranded region with a single-stranded tail that folds over to form a triplex, where this construct is made using a customised synthesis protocol. Over measurements of 48 triplex-forming constructs and their corresponding controls, we observe that triplexes inhibit gene expression more often than not. Our approach, Electrically Directed Gene Expression ( EDGE), could be used to modulate in vitro synthesis of RNA therapeutics and also has applications in smart biomaterials, where the RNA transcript would act as a signal for a change of state. To test EDGE, we produced customised 96-well plates and control electronics, demonstrating how 3D-printing and in-house manufacturing techniques can be used to provide hardware for unusual experiments with specific needs. With further development the EDGE methodology could also be used to enable electrical control over protein expression."
"In the initial phase of infections, prior to the development of the follicular antibody response, an extrafollicular B cell response develops in lymphoid organs, with activation of cells displaying B cell receptors with low affinity to the different epitopes of the invading pathogen. To evaluate if this response allows early protection in the murine host, we investigated its role during infection with Sylvio X10/4 (a low virulence Trypanosoma cruzi parasite) of CD28KO mice, a mouse strain that does not develop a follicular antibody response, in parallel with infected C57BL/6 mice (used as control). We observed that T. cruzi infection allowed CD28KO mice to survive for a long period of time, ranging from a few weeks to almost a year. However, the CD28KO mice showed higher levels of subpatent parasitemia than C57BL/6 mice, as well as more intense and long-lasting inflammatory infiltrates in the heart. Following the CD28KO mice throughout the infection, we found a significant reduction in the number of CD8+ T cells in the spleen, but not CD4+ T cells, as well as a strong fluctuation in the number of B cells. Meanwhile, although the production of IFN-{gamma} in the spleen was not affected by CD28 deficiency, a reduction in IL-2 production was observed in anti-CD3 stimulated CD4+ T cells from infected CD28KO mice. Regarding the humoral response, after confirming that the T follicular helper (TFH) cells and germinal center B cells (GC-B) were absent in the infected CD28KO mice, we demonstrated that the extrafollicular antibodies, present in CD28KO infected mice, allowed an early protection in the murine host, since the transfer of serum from chronic CD28KO mice to naive CD28KO mice, which were infected with T. cruzi 24 hours later, promoted a significant reduction in parasitemia. These results demonstrate that low-affinity anti-T cruzi extrafollicular antibodies contribute to the control of circulating parasites, allowing Sylvio X10/4-infected CD28KO mice to survive for a long time.

AUTHOR SUMMARYLow-affinity anti-T cruzi extrafollicular antibodies contribute to the control of circulating parasites, allowing Sylvio X10/4-infected CD28KO mice to survive for a long time."
"Glioblastoma, aggressive primary brain tumors with a dismal prognosis, promote the recruitment of microglia, brain resident innate immune cells, and ultimately their activation toward a tumor-supportive phenotype that increases gliomal proliferation and invasion capability. Here, we report that upon stimulation by glioma cells, microglia transit via a reactive state holding anti-tumoral properties coupled to reduced DNMT3A chromatin occupancy and DNA demethylation that promote microglial pro-inflammatory gene expressions. We find that upon repression of Dnmt3a expression in microglia, those cells maintain anti-tumoral attributes in vitro and in vivo. In a syngeneic immunocompetent glioblastoma mouse model, brain delivery of antisense oligonucleotide targeting Dnmt3a expression led to reduced tumor growth. Taken together, our results reveal the involvement of DNA demethylation in the control of glioma cells-induced microglia activation and indicate that microglial DNMT3A is a potentially therapeutic target to treat brain neoplasms such as glioblastoma that include a microglial component."
"No method has been developed for single-cell analysis of the large repositories of preserved whole blood samples stored in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes. To address this gap, two nuclei isolation techniques for single-nucleus RNA sequencing were evaluated: mechanical separation (MS), using an Acrodisc filter, and cell lysis (CL). While both methods captured nuclei from all major immune cell types, CL resulted in up to two orders of magnitude higher nuclei yields and less biased proportions of immune cells than MS. High ambient globin gene counts following CL were substantially reduced by CRISPR-guided globin gene depletion of complementary DNA, resulting in more sensitive and efficient gene detection per cell. Despite capturing only nuclear transcripts, CL-derived samples maintained similar cell-type proportions and gene expression as matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples, while retaining granulocytes. The CL isolation with globin depletion method enables comprehensive analysis of PAXgene whole blood samples at single-cell resolution.

MOTIVATIONPAXgene Blood RNA Tubes are commonly used for blood preservation and gene expression studies due to the ease of use and stabilization of RNA. To date, transcriptomic studies using PAXgene tubes have been limited to bulk RNA profiling approaches such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Here we introduce a method for recovering high-quality nuclei from frozen blood preserved in PAXgene tubes for single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq). Using this approach, all white blood cell types - including granulocytes - are captured, thereby enabling comprehensive transcriptomic profiling of peripheral blood at single-cell resolution."
"Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica co-infections in gastroenteritis cases are underexplored, particularly in relation to microbiome dysbiosis. This study uses metagenomic and culture-based approaches to investigate pathogen genotypes and stool microbiome composition. Stool samples from three patients were analysed using culture, qPCR and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of genomes and metagenomes. Strain typing and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling were conducted for both pathogens. The stool microbiome structure was compared between the three patients and across three time points in one patient.

C. jejuni and Salmonella enterica were of different strains and different proportions in the cases. C. jejuni sequence types were identified as ST-794, ST-50 and ST-10025, while S. enterica serovars Enteritidis ST-183 and S. Derby ST-39 were identified. C. jejuni AMR genotypes included blaOXA-447, gyrA (T86I), and tet(O). S. Enteritidis contained AMR gene mdsaA-B, and S. Derby contained mdsaA-B and fosA7 genes.

Despite similarities in Bristol scales for stool composition, the three cases exhibited distinct microbiome population structures, suggesting there is no one signature microbial profile of microbiomes with a Campylobacter-Salmonella co-infection. A temporal trend towards microbial diversity was observed within a patient, shifting from Proteobacteria dominance (93.3%) during acute infection towards Bacteroidetes (89.5%) abundance post-infection, suggesting that moving towards diverse communities may play a key role in patient recovery.

These findings reveal a case study of microbiome disruption for patients infected with C. jejuni and S. enterica and highlight the value of direct stool sequencing in understanding pathogen abundance in stool and microbiome dysbiosis."
"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of most insulin-producing {beta}-cells, along with dysregulated glucagon secretion from pancreatic -cells. We conducted an integrated analysis that combines electrophysiological and transcriptomic profiling, along with machine learning, of islet cells from T1D donors to investigate the mechanisms underlying their dysfunction. Surviving {beta}-cells exhibit altered electrophysiological properties and transcriptomic signatures indicative of increased antigen presentation, metabolic reprogramming, and impaired protein translation. In -cells, we observed hyper-responsiveness and increased exocytosis, which are associated with upregulated immune signaling, disrupted transcription factor localization and lysosome homeostasis, as well as dysregulation of mTORC1 complex signaling. Notably, key genetic risk signals for T1D were enriched in transcripts related to -cell dysfunction, including MHC class I which were closely linked with -cell dysfunction. Our data provide novel insights into the molecular underpinnings of islet cell dysfunction in T1D, highlighting pathways that may be leveraged to preserve residual {beta}-cell function and modulate -cell activity. These findings underscore the complex interplay between immune signaling, metabolic stress, and cellular identity in shaping islet cell phenotypes in T1D.

"LINE-1 (L1) is a type of mobile genetic element (retrotransposon) that can self-copy into distinct parts of its host genome by dynamically shaping its content. In humans, misregulation of these elements have been associated as the potential cause of distinct types of pathologies and neurodevelopmental disorders, including cancer, Rett syndrome and Aicardi Goutierrez disease. However, the precise annotation of these 6 kb long nucleotide sequence is a challenging task due to the high similarity between their internal regions (coding and non-coding) for distinct L1 families. Current L1 reference annotations such as RepeatMasker still lack sequence details and also provide confounding annotated information, that includes thousands of incomplete L1 sequences annotated as representative full-length, and missing information on their regulatory and coding regions (5UTR, ORF1, intron, ORF2 and 3UTR). Additionally, current L1 resources also provide annotations based on consensus reference genomes and does not include individual genome information at allele-level and nucleotide-level resolution. Here, we present L1Farm as a complementary databank and annotation resource that contains a comprehensive analysis and annotation of L1 subfamilies identified in the current human reference genome (build Hg38) and in two individual Asian and Caucasian genomes at allele-level and nucleotide-level resolution. L1 elements sequences were also annotated with genomic loci and ranked according to their full-length content and similarity."
"Pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) is a highly aggressive brain tumor characterized by transcriptional plasticity and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed diverse malignant and immune cell populations, with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) emerging as the primary source of SPP1 (osteopontin), a glycoprotein that suppresses T cell activation through CD44 binding. Cell-cell communication analysis identified the SPP1-CD44 axis as a dominant immunosuppressive pathway in the tumor microenvironment. Despite extensive transcription factor screening, no strong regulators of SPP1 were identified, suggesting regulation occurs via alternative mechanisms. To assess structural features of SPP1, replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations were performed, revealing that the CD44-binding domain is conformationally stable. Phosphorylation at Ser169, a conserved site, further stabilized this region, suggesting a potential mechanism for enhanced CD44 interaction. To disrupt this axis, among 2,500 variants of anti-SPP1 23C3 antibody, a lead candidate variant (23C3-v1) with improved SPP1 binding affinity and minimal sequence divergence was identified. Furthermore, humanized 23C3-v1 (Hu23C3-v1) was designed to neutralize Class I and Class II epitope hits from murine antibody derived 23C3-v1 antibody. Together, this study integrates transcriptomic and structural bioinformatics approaches to the target SPP1-CD44 axis, which can help reduce immunosuppressive characteristics of pHGG tumor microenvironment (TME)."
"Our work reveals the structure of the active state of Methyl-Coenzyme M Reductase (MCR), the key and rate-limiting enzyme in biological methane formation. We find large differences between the active Ni(I) and inactive Ni(II) proteins and provide insight into how nature makes and breaks the C-H bond of methane. The Ni(II)-F430 center in inactive MCR contains four planar nitrogen ligands, a lower axial glutamine oxo, and an upper axial thiolate. The Ni(I)-enzyme replaces the axial ligands with a single water. The one-electron redox change results in movement of the Ni ion and upward swing of the {beta}-lactam ring in the tetrapyrrole coupled to a domino-like protein quake through second sphere residues, inter-subunit interactions, a substrate tunnel, affecting even the dimensions of the unit cell. These structural changes lead Ni(I)-MCR to release a charge clamp that, in the Ni(II) state, locks down substrate Coenzyme B. Determining the Ni(I)-MCR structure required development of rigorous anaerobic crystallographic techniques. Validation of the MCR redox state was accomplished by in-line and parallel spectroscopic and unit cell analyses. This structure has large implications for developing technologies to limit methane emissions and efficiently produce biofuels. Methodology described here will enhance structural biology for other oxygen-sensitive enzymes."
"The increasing availability of protein structures presents new opportunities for detecting homologous proteins. While global alignment methods are widely used and generally effective, they often struggle to identify related structures obscured by differences in protein size and domain architecture. To address this limitation, we introduce Structome-TM, a web server for protein structure comparison and phylogenetic analysis using TM-score as a metric. By emphasizing local structural alignments, Structome-TM improves the detection of homologous proteins that global methods might overlook. With a user-friendly interface and efficient pairwise comparisons, Structome-TM expands the structural neighbourhood landscape and facilitates phylogenetic reconstruction.

"When enteropathogenic bacteria breach the intestinal epithelium, they are recognized by epithelial and immune cells that elicit an intestinal regenerative response. However, less is known about whether and how intestinal progenitors directly detect invading pathogenic bacteria and couple this to their proliferation. Here we show that adult Drosophila midgut progenitors recognise peptidoglycan from pathogenic bacteria through the peptidoglycan recognition proteins, PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE, and translate this to ISC proliferation by stimulating MKK3-p38 signalling. Moreover, we find that PGRP-LC/LE-MKK3-p38 signalling in progenitors regulates p38 activation throughout the midgut epithelium after infection, indicating that progenitors can influence the regenerative niche in a non-cell autonomous manner. Whilst it was previously thought that ISC proliferation in both mammals and flies is driven solely by damage-induced signals after infection, our work reveals that progenitors can directly recognise pathogenic bacteria and mount a strong parallel regenerative response that spreads throughout the midgut epithelium. Increased ISC proliferation after bacterial recognition may also serve as a strategy to repopulate the epithelium with uninfected cells."
"The conserved GTPase Cdc42 is a major regulator of polarized growth in most eukaryotes. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Cdc42 activity displays anticorrelated oscillatory dynamics between the growing ends enabling bipolarity. Cdc42 at each end is activated only when the opposite end loses activity. This suggests that a regulator of Cdc42 likely travels end-to-end to activate Cdc42. The oscillatory dynamics between the growing ends have also been observed in Cdc42 activator Scd1, its scaffold Scd2. It is unclear how these proteins move between the ends to facilitate bipolarity. We find that Scd1 does not travel between the cell ends via actin-mediated delivery. Instead, we show that Scd1 is mostly cytoplasmic and diffuses between the cell ends. The rate of diffusion is not entirely proportional to increasing the mass of Scd1 and cells lacking the inhibitor Pak1 kinase show decreased diffusion. Moreover, we show that Scd1 diffuses at a much faster rate compared to its scaffold Scd2. These findings suggest that Scd1 diffusion is not random and is regulated by Pak1 kinase. We find that decreasing the rate of diffusion disrupts Cdc42 oscillatory dynamics and results in monopolarity. Our results show that end-to-end Scd1 diffusion drives Cdc42 oscillatory dynamics and regulates cell polarity.

"De novo shoot regeneration via the two-step tissue culture method is widely used for vegetative reproduction of plants and for gene transformation and editing. A key step in tissue culture is the fate transition from shoot progenitor cells (SPCs) to productive SPCs (prSPCs), which are capable of differentiating into a shoot. In this study, we identified the class I KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factor gene SHOOT-MERISTEMLESS (STM) as the key controller of, and marker gene for, the fate transition from SPCs into prSPCs, indicating that STM might serve as a candidate of molecular tools to improve de novo shoot regeneration in the agricultural applications."
"BACKGROUNDAtrial fibrillation (AF) susceptibility is heightened in endurance athletes but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Because pulmonary vein (PV) myocyte triggers are critical determinants of AF, we investigated PV electrophysiological remodelling in animal models of the athletes heart.

METHODSThe following experiments were performed in canines and mice after 16 or 6 weeks, respectively, of daily exercise training (ExT), and compared to sedentary (Sed) controls: ECG recording, echocardiography, pharmacological autonomic block, extrastimulus pacing, multielectrode array mapping, monophasic and intracellular action potential (AP) recording with custom-designed pattern recognition analysis, histology, RNAseq and spatial in situ transcriptomics.

RESULTSAF propensity was significantly increased in ExT animals. Mapping studies identified heightened rotational activity in the PV-left atrial (LA) junction of ExT vs. Sed canines in vivo, and enhanced automaticity, triggered activity and AP duration variability ex vivo in ExT canines and mice. Intracellular recordings in mouse PV cardiomyocytes determined at least six AP subtypes with increased frequency of pacemaker-like APs in ExT PV, concomitant with increased expression of pacemaking HCN4, Cav1.3 and Cav3.1 channels. PV spontaneous excitability was also significantly enhanced. Subcellular resolution spatial transcriptomics in mouse PV-LA identified diffuse ion channel remodelling and activation of established AF-promoting pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and chemokines in ExT PV cardiomyocytes. Conduction slowing in the ExT PV-LA junction was attributable to: gap junction remodelling, reduced Na+ channel expression and increased extracellular matrix deposition with enhanced myofibroblast number and proximity to PV cardiomyocytes.

CONCLUSIONSEndurance exercise elicits proarrhythmic electro-anatomical remodelling of the PV-LA junction with enhanced pacemaking ion channel expression and immune-inflammatory pathway activation in PV myocytes as prominent contributors.

"Although language neuroscience has largely focused on  core left frontal and temporal brain areas and their right-hemisphere homotopes, numerous other areas--cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar--have been implicated in linguistic processing. However, these areas contributions to language remain unclear given that the evidence for their recruitment comes from diverse paradigms, many of which conflate language processing with perceptual, motor, or task-related cognitive processes. Using fMRI data from 772 participants performing an extensively-validated language  localizer paradigm that isolates language processing from other processes, we a) delineate a comprehensive set of areas that respond reliably to language across written and auditory modalities, and b) evaluate these areas selectivity for language relative to a demanding non-linguistic task. In line with prior claims, many areas outside the core fronto-temporal network respond during language processing, and most of them show selectivity for language relative to general task demands. These language-selective areas of the extended language network include areas around the temporal poles, in the medial frontal cortex, in the hippocampus, and in the cerebellum, among others. Although distributed across many parts of the brain, the extended language-selective network still only comprises [~]1.2% of the brains volume and is about the size of a strawberry, challenging the view that language processing is broadly distributed across the cortical surface. These newly identified language-selective areas can now be systematically characterized to decipher their contributions to language processing, including testing whether these contributions differ from those of the core language areas.

Significance statementLanguage processing consistently recruits a left-lateralized fronto-temporal brain network, but language tasks often engage areas outside this core system. In an fMRI dataset of 772 participants performing a validated language localizer task, we identified 17 brain areas outside the core network that respond to both auditory and written language. Most of these areas show selectivity for language, including regions in the temporal poles, medial frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Despite its large number of components, this extended language network still only takes up [~]1.2% of the brains volume, challenging the view that language processing is broadly distributed in the brain. These findings lay the foundation for systematically characterizing these newly identified non-canonical language-selective areas."
"Mechanical forces are essential for tissue morphogenesis, but risk causing ruptures that could compromise tissue function. In epithelial tissues, adherens junctions withstand the forces that drive morphogenesis by recruiting proteins that stabilize cell adhesion and reinforce connections to the actin cytoskeleton under tension. However, how junctional actin networks respond to forces in vivo is not well understood. Here we show that the actin crosslinker Fimbrin is recruited to tricellular junctions under tension and plays a central role in amplifying actomyosin contractility and stabilizing cell adhesion. Loss of Fimbrin results in a failure to reorganize actin under tension and an inability to enhance myosin-II activity and recruit junction-stabilizing proteins in response to force, disrupting cell adhesion. Conversely, increasing Fimbrin activity constitutively activates force-response pathways, aberrantly stabilizing adhesion. These results demonstrate that Fimbrin-mediated actin crosslinking is an essential step in modulating actomyosin dynamics and reinforcing cell adhesion under tension during epithelial remodeling."
"Cells under high confinement form highly polarized hydrostatic pressure-driven, stable leader blebs that enable efficient migration in low adhesion, environments. Here we investigated the basis of the polarized bleb morphology of metastatic melanoma cells migrating in non-adhesive confinement. Using high-resolution time-lapse imaging and specific molecular perturbations, we found that EGF signaling via PI3K stabilizes and maintains a polarized leader bleb. Protein activity biosensors revealed a unique EGFR and PI3K activity gradient decreasing from rear-to-front, promoting PIP3 and Rac1-GTP accumulation at the bleb rear, with its antagonists PIP2 and RhoA-GTP concentrated at the bleb tip, opposite to the front-to-rear organization of these signaling modules in integrin-mediated mesenchymal migration. Optogenetic experiments showed that disrupting this gradient caused bleb retraction, underscoring the role of this signaling gradient in bleb stability. Mathematical modeling and experiments identified a mechanism where, as the bleb initiates, CD44 and ERM proteins restrict EGFR mobility in a membrane-apposed cortical actin meshwork in the bleb rear, establishing a rear-to-front EGFR-PI3K-Rac activity gradient. Thus, our study reveals the biophysical and molecular underpinnings of cell polarity in bleb-based migration of metastatic cells in non-adhesive confinement, and underscores how alternative spatial arrangements of migration signaling modules can mediate different migration modes according to the local microenvironment."
"Genomic resources, new microsatellite markers and a novel observation of a fractal pattern of the genetic population structure are presented for curimba Prochilodus lineatus, a suitable model organism for freshwater migratory species in South America. Our main goals were to investigate the presence of mixed fish stocks, the effects of isolation by dams and broodstocking over the genetic diversity for this species. We focused on the upper segment of the extremely fragmented Grande River, MG, Brazil, from the megadiverse continental La Plata Basin. Two main co-occurring genetically admixed stocks were identified by maximum likelihood estimation and iteratively unfolded with two further steps, through a hierarchical analysis of genetic structure. It consistently unveiled two newly defined internal groups, from the previously resolved clusters (23). We suggest this stratified pattern of mixed stocks from the main river channel may be attributed to the existence of different, well defined breeding grounds, nested within differential scales throughout this basin, arranged according to fractal geometry (1st order river, 2nd and 3rd order tributaries, and so on). This would imply in homing behaviour for this species. Our work also provides massive molecular data for this fish, including its first draft genome assembly and a valuable panel for the rapid and low-cost development of new microsatellite DNA markers. These findings will likely benefit researchers and environmental managers in tackling challenging issues regarding the conservation of Neotropical migratory fishes, as they support the hypothesis of the isolating effects of dams and broodstocking over genetic variability. More importantly, the results presented here point to the potential role of tributaries of different orders in harbouring genetically diverse populations of migratory freshwater fishes."
"Mollusks are an abundant group of animals with many economically important members that are phylogenetically distinct from nearly all genetic model organisms. This study provides clade-wide evaluation of sRNA biogenesis pathways, with emphasis on the easter oyster, Crassostrea virginica. Understanding these molecules prescribes RNAi-based gene silencing approaches, benefiting genetic investigation and biotechnology. Similar to other animal groups, mollusks have conserved microRNAs (miRNAs) with some shared with ecdysozoans and deuterostomes; however, there was no evidence of an endogenous small-interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway. These results suggest that long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-based RNAi is not appropriate for gene silencing in Mollusks as well as other members of the broader Lophotrochozoan clade. The study also finds an abundance of piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in both soma and gonads. Differences are also found in piRNA biology. Many invertebrates exhibit somatic piRNAs; however, mollusk piRNAs appear to be restricted to a subset of cells, limiting the potential of piRNA-based RNAi. Further, individual animals also express a unique collection of piRNAs that seem to be only partially determined through inheritance from both parents. Together this work defines the RNAi mechanisms in mollusks, which represent 23% of animals, and provides insights into the phenotypic diversity seen in this group.

Significance StatementThis study provides an extensive, clade-wide evaluation of small RNA (sRNA) biogenesis pathways in mollusks. Our findings reveal that, unlike ecdysozoans and deuterostomes, mollusks lack a functional siRNA pathway, which fundamentally changes expectations around RNA interference (RNAi) applications in Mollusca. Instead, we find the expected microRNAs and an assortment of piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). We show that piRNA biology in mollusks is highly cell-type specific and genetically individualized. We further demonstrate that piRNA expression is likely linked to stem-like, quiescent cells, suggesting a critical role in genomic maintenance. This work offers insight into RNAi potential in mollusks, the second largest animal phylum, and has significant implications for both basic biology and applied sciences such as pest control and aquaculture."
"Humans have a remarkable capacity to adjust reaching movements rapidly and accurately when visual targets jump to a new location. The short latency of such online corrections has led to the hypothesis that they constitute a distinct class of movement and arise from an  automatic pilot that is selectively engaged only during ongoing movements. However, concrete evidence for this hypothesis is scarce.

Here, we test this idea by measuring muscle recruitment, force, and kinematics in a jumping target reaching task. In separate blocks of trials, participants were instructed to respond to target jumps by (1) following the jumped target, (2) stopping the on-going movement, or (3) ignoring the jumped target. This allowed us to establish the automaticity and timing of responses to target jumps and to compare such measures to the original reaching movement initiated from rest.

We find that the earliest phase of muscle recruitment elicited by the jumped target corresponds to a subcortical reflex, beginning at [~]80ms and ending by [~]120ms, preceding the onset of voluntary recruitment at [~]130ms. This reflex inexorably drives a reaching adjustment towards the new target in all three blocks; it is only somewhat reduced in the  stop and  ignore blocks. Critically, this earliest phase of muscle recruitment was also present at the exact same latency (80ms) for the original reaching movement initiated from rest. Thus, rather than supporting the model of online corrections as distinct class of movement that is mediated by an  automatic pilot, our results suggest that all reaches, whether adjusted in mid-flight or initiated from rest, arise from a common nested control system featuring subcortical and cortical components whose influence can be strategically preset by task demands."
"The Tandem of pore domain in a Weak Inward Rectifying K+ channel 2 (TWIK-2; KCNK6) is a member of the Two-Pore Domain K+ (K2P) channel family, which is associated with pulmonary hypertension, lung injury, and inflammation. The structure and regulatory mechanisms of TWIK-2 remain largely unknown. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human TWIK-2 at [~]3.7 [A] and highlight its conserved and unique features. Using automated whole-cell patch clamp recordings, we demonstrate that gating in TWIK-2 is voltage-dependent and insensitive to changes in the extracellular pH. We identify key residues that influence TWIK-2 activity by employing structure and sequence-guided site-directed mutagenesis and provide insights into the possible mechanism of TWIK-2 regulation. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of high-throughput automated whole-cell patch clamp platforms to screen small molecule modulators of TWIK-2. Our work serves as a foundation for designing high-throughput small molecule screening campaigns to identify specific high-affinity TWIK-2 modulators, including promising new anti-inflammatory therapeutics."
"The evolution of modern humans is as fascinating as it is complicated. Various environmental and socio-political factors have played a significant role in shaping different migratory paths and lifestyles in ancient times and the establishment of current sub-populations around the globe. These factors have impacted the molecular evolution of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). To account for the role of genetic background and variable sites in shaping the migratory and evolutionary paths, we analyzed the ancient mtDNA as spatiotemporal co-mutation networks. Haplogroup-based analysis of the variable sites suggests a transition from hunter-gatherer to agrarian lifestyle during the Copper-Bronze transition period. Furthermore, the genetic interaction networks showed that COX and CYB genes behaved diversely with time and that there is an interplay of the genetic interactions with NADH Dehydrogenase genes specific to each age. We performed a phylogeny (tree) based gene network analysis and examined polymorphism to divergence ratios to complement the co-mutation networks. The tree-based gene networks exhibit similar topology with reduced co-mutation among the genes. The more traditional polymorphism/divergence analysis indicated that the CYB gene has been under long-term purifying selection. In contrast, other genes (ATP6, COX, NADH hydrogenases) have undergone episodes of purifying selection corresponding to different ages. We believe this network-based exploratory study provides insights into early lifestyle transitions and haplogroup establishment of the current human population."
"In multicellular organisms such as animals and plants, development requires the precise regulation of gene expression, mediated not only by transcription factors but also by chromatin-based mechanisms. Among these, histone modifications like H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 play opposing roles in gene activation and repression, respectively. In Arabidopsis thaliana, H3K27me3 is deposited by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), while Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins mediate H3K4me3 deposition. While the functions of these writer complexes have been extensively studied, far less is known about the histone mark readers that interpret these modifications during development. Here, we investigate the antagonistic interplay between H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 during Arabidopsis embryogenesis. We identify a developmentally specific interaction between the FIS-PRC2 complex and ALFIN-LIKE (AL) proteins--a family of plant-specific PHD domain proteins that read H3K4me3. Our findings reveal a dynamic competition between these two marks during early embryogenesis that helps shape the epigenomic landscape of the developing seed. Disruption of AL function leads to severe developmental defects and loss of cell identity in early embryos. Moreover, loss of ALs impairs H3K4me3 deposition, resulting in aberrant spreading of H3K27me3, misregulation of developmental genes, and defects that persist into adult plant traits.

Together, our results show that proper embryonic development relies on a finely tuned antagonism between activating and repressive chromatin states--an interplay orchestrated not only by their writers but also by specific readers that translate these epigenetic cues into developmental outcomes."
"Microalgal hydrogen production driven by solar energy offers significant promise as a sustainable energy alternative, yet remains economically challenging due to issues of scalability from laboratory to industrial applications. Here, we demonstrate scalable hydrogen production at semi-industrial volumes using the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii pgr5 mutant, employing an optimized cultivation protocol and photobioreactor design. This approach achieves a fivefold increase in hydrogen yield. Notably, the post-production biomass maintains a high-quality protein and nutrients profile, emphasizing microalgae as a ""green coin"" with energy security on one side and food security on the other. Techno-economic analysis suggests, achievable hydrogen production costs could reach $2.70/kg H2 under projected improvements, and potentially decrease furthur to $1.48/kg with full optimization. By effectively bridging laboratory research and practical industrial implementation, our study establishes a dual-purpose algal hydrogen production platform aligned with circular economy principles, positioning microalgae prominently within sustainable energy and food frameworks."
"While monogenic variants in CDC45-MCM-GINS (CMG) replisome proteins cause human natural killer cell deficiencies (NKD), family members with the same inherited variants often have variable clinical and cellular phenotypes. We investigated two siblings with inherited compound heterozygous GINS4 variants but variable disease expressivity. Cell cycle impairment and increased apoptosis were detected following NK cell lineage commitment but not in pluripotent cells. While this effect was detected in both siblings, the efficiency of NK cell differentiation was variable and correlated with differential clinical severity of NKD. Further investigation of allelic expression of inherited GINS4 variants demonstrated expected biallelic expression of GINS4 in pluripotent cells and progenitors. However, allelic bias in lineage-committed NK cells led to over- or under-representation of more damaging GINS4 heterozygous variants associated with differential cellular and clinical severity. This study identifies allelic bias that causes phenotypic variation of monogenic diseases and defines mechanisms underlying immunodeficiency."
"Developing organisms exhibit varying susceptibility to environmental pollutants depending on the timing of exposure during development. Early-life development is particularly vulnerable, and many marine species spend early life in nearshore environments, elevating their risk of pollutant exposure. Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants are persistent and ubiquitous pollutants, particularly in nearshore marine environments. They disrupt early-life development and pose ongoing risks for ocean health. However, whether early-life exposure influences neurotoxic effects, and whether those effects are durable throughout life, remains poorly understood. Using Fundulus heteroclitus, we tested whether early-life exposure to 2,2,4,4,5-pentaBDE (BDE-99) leads to persistent behavioral and molecular alterations in adulthood and whether outcomes differ by exposure route. We conducted two complementary experiments comparing progenitor (maternal) exposure and direct waterborne exposure during embryonic development. Similar doses to developing fish were achieved in both experiments.

After hatch, all fish were reared in clean water until adulthood over two years later, at which time we assessed impacts on behavior and brain gene expression. Both exposure routes led to long-term hyperactivity and reduced anxiety-like behavior, but specific effects varied by dose and sex. Progenitor exposure altered behavior and the brain transcriptome in F1 males (females not tested), whereas direct embryonic exposure affected behavior in females and not males.

These findings highlight the importance of maternal influences, such as chemical metabolites, altered lipid provisioning, small molecules, and epigenetic imprinting, alongside chemical transfer, in shaping the long-term persistence of behavioral and molecular effects from early-life exposure. The distinct effects between exposure routes suggest that dosing with chemical alone is not the only determinant of toxicity. We conclude that maternal factors that are modified by exposure significantly contribute to health outcomes in developing offspring, emphasizing the need to consider exposure route when assessing risks from persistent pollutants. Given that maternal and environmental exposures co-occur in nature, future studies should assess their combined impacts to better predict real-world risks."
"D-aspartate is an endogenous agonist of NMDA and mGlu5 receptors, with a distinctive spatiotemporal expression profile that peaks in the prenatal and early postnatal brain. This suggests a critical role for D-aspartate metabolism in modulating neurodevelopmental processes linked to glutamatergic neurotransmission. However, the precise mechanisms through which D-aspartate exerts its effects remain unclear. To elucidate the molecular pathways orchestrated by early D-aspartate signalling, we employed a knockin mouse model characterized by constitutive D-aspartate depletion due to the prenatal expression of its degradative enzyme, D-aspartate oxidase. Using an advanced quantitative proteomic approach based on Tandem Mass Tag isobaric labelling and nano-liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, we investigated the proteomic variations induced by D-aspartate depletion during postnatal brain development comparing Ddo knockin mice with their wild-type littermates. Our findings reveal that D-aspartate modulates the neonatal expression of proteins involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission, nervous system development, and cytoskeleton organization. Moreover, proteomic analysis identified a subset of D-aspartate-regulated proteins mapping molecular pathways associated with autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. These findings offer new perspectives on the complex protein networks influenced by D-aspartate metabolism in the developing brain and highlight its potential impact on cerebral function in health and psychiatric disorders."
"The Hsp90 machinery is the most complex chaperone system in the eukaryotic cell. It is characterized by numerous co-chaperones that modulate the function of Hsp90. In S. cerevisiae, most of these cofactors can be deleted without affecting viability. Of the three essential ones, only the function of Sgt1 remained enigmatic. Our in vivo and in vitro experiments define key structural elements and determine the essential function of Sgt1 in the chaperoning of client proteins. We show that yeast Sgt1 exhibits a unique binding mode to Hsp90. The simultaneous interaction of Sgt1 with Hsp90 and client proteins enhances client maturation efficiency. Specifically, Sgt1 stabilizes Hsp90-client complexes and prevents their dissociation by the co-chaperone Aha1. Together, our findings reveal a distinct regulatory mechanism of the Hsp90 function, highlighting Sgt1 as a critical modulator of chaperone cycle progression."
"Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) is a leading cause of infection-related mortality in humans globally. The characteristic cell wall-anchored Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) is expressed by all S. pyogenes strains and consists of a polyrhamnose backbone with alternating N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) side chains, of which 25% are decorated with glycerol phosphate (GroP). The genes in the gacA-L cluster are critical for GAC biosynthesis with gacH-L being responsible for the characteristic GlcNAc-GroP decoration, which confers the agglutination in rapid test diagnostic assays and contributes to S. pyogenes pathogenicity. Historical research papers described S. pyogenes isolates, so-called A-variant strains, that lost the characteristic GlcNAc side chain following serial animal passage. Genomic analysis of a single viable historic parent/A-variant strain pair revealed a premature inactivating stop codon in gacI, explaining the described loss of the GlcNAc side chain. Subsequently, we analyzed the genetic variation of the 12 gacA-L genes in a collection of 2,021 S. pyogenes genome sequences. Although all gac genes (gacA-L) displayed genetic variation, we only identified 26 isolates (1.3%) with a premature stop codon in one of the gac genes. Twelve out of 26 (46%) isolates contained a premature stop codon in gacH, which encodes the enzyme responsible for the GroP modification. To study the functional consequences of the different premature stop codons for GacH function, we plasmid-expressed three gacH variants in a S. pyogenes gacH-deficient strain. Cell wall analysis confirmed GacH loss-of-function for the studied gacH variants through the significant reduction of GAC GroP, complete resistance to killing by the human bactericidal enzyme group IIA-secreted phospholipase, and susceptibility to zinc toxicity. Overall, our data provide a comprehensive overview of the genetic variation of the gacA-L cluster in a global population of S. pyogenes strains and the functional consequences of rare inactivating mutations in gacH for host interaction."
"As climate change increases global water temperatures, ecologists expect intestinal helminth infection ranges to expand and increase the health burden on aquatic organisms. However, the gut microbiome can interact with these parasites to influence infection outcomes, raising the possibility that its response to increasing temperatures may help buffer against increased infection burden. To evaluate this hypothesis, we sought to determine if the microbiome is resistant or resilient to the stressors of increased water temperature, helminth exposure, and their combination, and whether this variation linked to infection outcomes. We leveraged the zebrafish (Danio rerio) model organism to measure how these variables relate to the temporal dynamics of the gut microbiome. In particular, we exposed adult zebrafish to the parasitic whipworm Pseudocapillaria tomentosa across three different water temperatures (28{degrees}C, 32{degrees}C, 35{degrees}C), and analyzed fecal microbiome samples at five time points across 42 days. Our findings show that parasite exposure and water temperature independently alter gut microbiome diversity. Moreover, we find that water temperature moderates the association between parasite infection and the gut microbiome. Consistent with this observation, but at odds with current expectations, we find that increasing water temperature reduces parasitic infection in fish. Overall, our results indicate that water temperature alters the contextual landscape of the gut microbiome to impact its response to an exogenous stressor of an intestinal parasite in zebrafish. Furthermore, our findings represent the first report of the effects of elevated temperature on parasitic nematode development in a fish host. Importantly, our study demonstrates that climate change may have unanticipated and environmentally contingent impacts to vertebrate gut microbiomes and health outcomes in response to an exogenous stressor."
"BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD), disproportionally affecting women, is generally regarded as a disease of the brain. Yet, cumulative evidence increasingly supports a more systemic, full-body view on this incurable disorder, with the liver and kidneys playing an important role in amyloid clearance. The latter is likely potentiated by caloric restriction (CR), but its impact on the metabolism of key amyloid-handling tissues is poorly understood.

MethodsWe examined the sex-specific effects of amyloidosis and CR on oxidative and metabolic processes in APPPS1 mice, expressing mutant amyloidogenic proteins under the neuronal Thy-1 promoter. Wild-type (WT) and APPPS1 mice were either fed ad libitum (AL) or received 70% of their individual AL intake (CR regimen).

ResultsCompared to age-matched WT controls, the brain, liver, and kidney of 9-month-old AL APPPS1 mice exhibited higher levels of oxidative stress markers along with altered activity of antioxidant enzymes, including higher superoxide dismutase and lower catalase activity. These differences were sex- and tissue-specific, with kidneys showing the largest AD-induced differences between sexes. As for key glycolytic enzymes, APPPS1 mice possessed higher activity of pyruvate kinase than WT mice in all organs and higher hexokinase and phosphofructokinase activities in the brain, with stronger effects observed in males. CR intensified oxidative stress in the liver and the female brain but reduced it in the female kidney. Moreover, it potentiated glycolysis predominantly in females and modulated glutathione-dependent enzymes in a sex-dependent manner.

ConclusionsNeuron-driven amyloidosis induces strong and significant metabolic changes in the entire body, encompassing ubiquitous oxidative damage, enhancement of glycolysis, and antioxidant defense. The lower activity of glycolytic enzymes in the female brain and decreased antioxidant defense in the female liver and kidney provide yet another facet to the complex picture of female vulnerability in AD. Females seemed to profit more from CR, but the general CR effect was not very strong."
"The insular cortex serves as a critical hub for human cognition, but how its anatomically distinct subregions coordinate diverse cognitive, emotional, and social functions remains unclear. Using the Human Connectome Projects multi-task fMRI dataset (N=524), we investigated how insular subregions dynamically engage during seven different cognitive tasks spanning executive function, social cognition, emotion, language, and motor control. Our findings reveal five key principles of human insular organization. First, insular subregions maintain distinct functional signatures that enable reliable differentiation based on activation and connectivity patterns across cognitive domains. Second, these subregions dynamically reconfigure their network interactions in response to specific task demands while preserving their core functional architecture. Third, clear functional specialization exists along the insulas dorsal-ventral axis: the dorsal anterior insula selectively responds to cognitive control demands through interactions with frontoparietal networks, while the ventral anterior insula preferentially processes emotional and social information via connections with limbic and default mode networks. Fourth, we observed counterintuitive connectivity patterns during demanding cognitive tasks, with the dorsal anterior insula decreasing connectivity to frontoparietal networks while increasing connectivity to default mode networks - suggesting a complex information routing mechanism rather than simple co-activation of task-relevant networks. Fifth, while a basic tripartite model captures core functional distinctions, finer-grained parcellations revealed additional cognitive domain-specific advantages that are obscured by simpler parcellation approaches. Our results illuminate how the insulas organization supports its diverse functional roles through selective engagement of distinct neural networks, providing a new framework for understanding both normal cognitive function and clinical disorders involving insular dysfunction."
"Decision confidence plays a key role in flexible behavior and (meta)cognition, but its underlying neural mechanisms remain elusive. To uncover the latent dynamics of confidence formation at the level of single neurons and population activity, we trained nonhuman primates to report choice and confidence with a single eye movement on every trial. Monkey behavior was well fit by a bounded accumulator model instantiating parallel processing of evidence, rejecting a serial model in which the choice is resolved first followed by post-decision accumulation for confidence. Neurons in area LIP reflected concurrent accumulation, showing covariation of choice and confidence signals across the population, and within-trial dynamics consistent with parallel updating at near-zero time lag. The results demonstrate that the primate brain can process a single stream of evidence in service of two computational goals simultaneously--a categorical decision and associated level of confidence--and illuminate a candidate neural substrate for this capacity."
"The human cerebral cortex undergoes a complex developmental process during gestation, characterised by rapid cortical expansion and gyrification. This study investigates in vivo cortical growth trajectories using longitudinal MRI data from fetal and preterm cohorts. We employed anatomically constrained multimodal surface matching (aMSM) to quantify cortical surface area expansion and compare in-utero versus ex-utero cortical growth using cortical surface data from 22 to 44 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA), acquired as part of the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). Our findings revealed distinct regional and temporal growth patterns during the 2nd and 3rdrd trimesters of healthy fetal cortical expansion. Ex utero brain development following preterm birth was shown to follow a modified trajectory compared to normal gestation, with potential implications for cortical organisation. Our methodology, combining biomechanically constrained surface registration with high quality fetal and neonatal imaging, provides a powerful framework for understanding early cortical development and deviations associated with preterm birth."
"Unconventional secretion of Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) is based upon direct self-translocation across the plasma membrane, a process that involves the transient formation of a lipidic membrane pore. The opening of this pore is triggered by PI(4,5)P2-dependent oligomerization of FGF2 at the inner plasma membrane leaflet. Subsequently, FGF2 oligomers populating the pore are captured by membrane-proximal heparan sulfate chains of Glypican-1 (GPC1), resulting in translocation of FGF2 to cell surfaces. PI(4,5)P2 is a highly negatively charged membrane lipid that is exclusively localized at the inner plasma membrane leaflet. Therefore, local accumulation of PI(4,5)P2 triggered by FGF2 oligomerization at the inner plasma membrane leaflet produces a steep and spatially restricted electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. Furthermore, PI(4,5)P2 has a wedge-like shape, turning it into a non-bilayer lipid that destabilizes membranes at high local concentrations. Here we demonstrate that an asymmetric distribution of PI(4,5)P2 across the leaflets of synthetic lipid bilayers accelerates the opening of FGF2-induced membrane pores. Consistently, we find unconventional secretion of FGF2 from cells to be inhibited under conditions compromising the native transbilayer asymmetry of PI(4,5)P2 of plasma membranes. We propose the asymmetric distribution of PI(4,5)P2 to lower the free energy required to transform the lipid bilayer into a lipidic membrane pore. Furthermore, in the proximity of FGF2 membrane translocation sites, PI(4,5)P2 in the outer plasma membrane leaflet could potentially repel negatively charged heparan sulfates chains compromising the function of GPC1 in FGF2 translocation into the extracellular space. Thus, transbilayer asymmetry of PI(4,5)P2 is a key parameter enabling fast kinetics of FGF2 membrane translocation into the extracellular space."
"Plant cells control their volume by regulating the osmotic potential of their cytoplasm and vacuole. Water is attracted into the cell as the result of a cascade of solute exchanges between the cell subcompartments and the cell surroundings, which are governed by chemical, electrostatic and mechanical forces. Due to this multi-physics aspect and to couplings between changes of volumes and chemical effects, modeling these exchanges remains a challenge that has only been partially adressed. In this paper, we introduce an energy-based approach to couple chemical, electrical and mechanical processes taking place between several subcompartments of a plant cell. The contributions of all physical effects are gathered in an energy function that allows us to derive the equations satisfied by each variable in a systematical way. This results in a modular, unified approach that can be interpreted analytically. We illustrate these properties on the modeling of ion and water transport in a guard cell during stoma opening. We represent the stoma opening process as a quasi-static evolution driven by hydrogen pumps in the plasma and vacuolar membranes, resulting in an interpretable model with few parameters. We perform numerical simulations to investigate the role of each hydrogen pump in this process. We show that this energy-based approach allows us to highlight a hierarchy between the forces involved in the system, that can be exploited to interpret the emergent properties of this complex multi-physics system."
"SC05-UT is an anaerobic mixed microbial enrichment culture that reduces chloroform (CF) to dichloromethane (DCM) through reductive dechlorination, which it further mineralizes to carbon dioxide. This DCM mineralization yields electron equivalents that are used to reduce CF without addition of exogenous electron donor. By studying this self-feeding CF-amended culture and a DCM-amended enrichment culture (DCME), we previously found the genomic potential to perform both biodegradation steps in two distinct Dehalobacter strains: Dehalobacter restrictus SAD and Candidatus Dehalobacter alkaniphilus DAD. Though present in each enrichment culture, strain SAD is more abundant in CF-fed subculture SC05-UT, while strain DAD is more prominent in the DCM-fed subculture DCME. To understand if genomic differences between strains and impact their metabolic mechanisms, the genome of each strain was curated to reconstruct genome-scale metabolic models of each strain, which were then constrained based on thermodynamic and experimental conditions. We demonstrate that metabolic differences between the two strains may allow Dehalobacter strain DAD to outcompete strain SAD in the absence of CF, while strain SAD exhibits an advantage in the presence of CF. Additionally, we predict electron cycling methods to reconcile redox imbalances in the cell is required for tandem CF and DCM dechlorination. This work highlights the importance of hydrogen and amino acid exchange in these microbial communities and contributes to the growing body of work surrounding organohalide syntrophy.

ImportanceChloroform and dichloromethane contaminate groundwater around the world but can be remediated by microbes capable of metabolizing these toxic compounds. Here we study two distinct strains of Dehalobacter and show that while both strains can degrade both chloroform and dichloromethane, differences in their genetic makeup allow each strain to thrive under different environmental conditions. This has implications for understanding the fate of halogenated methanes in the environment and the application of Dehalobacter for bioremediation of chlorinated compounds."
"Intratumoral heterogeneity drives therapy resistance and relapses in advanced stage cancers, such as ovarian cancer. Here, we present a live cell imaging assay using patient-derived ovarian cancer organoids for real time capture and quantification of natural killer cell-mediated apoptotic events in >500 organoids simultaneously. Our assay revealed significant inter- and intratumor response heterogeneity and identified a rare resistant organoid population, opening avenues to test immunomodulatory strategies that overcome resistance."
"Argonautes are ancient proteins with well-characterised functions in cell-autonomous gene regulation and genome defense but less clear roles in non-cell-autonomous processes. Extracellular Argonautes have been reported across plants, animals and protozoa yet their biochemical and functional properties remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that an extracellular Argonaute (exWAGO) released by the rodent-infective parasitic nematode Heligmosomoides bakeri is detectable inside mouse cells during the natural infection. We further show that exWAGO is released from H.bakeri in both vesicular and non-vesicular forms that have different resistances to proteolysis, different accessibilities to antibodies and associate with different subsets of secondary siRNAs. Using recombinant exWAGO protein we demonstrate that non-vesicular exWAGO is directly internalised by mouse cells in vitro and that immunisation of mice with exWAGO confers partial protection against subsequent H. bakeri infection and generates antibodies that block exWAGO uptake into cells. Finally, we show that properties of exWAGO are conserved across Clade V nematodes that infect humans and livestock. Together this work expands the context in which Argonautes function and illuminates an RNA-binding protein as a vaccine target for parasitic nematodes."
"How are memories stored and subsequently retrieved? Pattern separation and pattern completion are distinct neurocognitive hippocampal processes that are thought to facilitate encoding and retrieval of memories. However, the way in which these operations affect the quality of memory remains unclear and there is currently no single behavioural task in humans to measure both mechanisms simultaneously. Here, we describe a novel paradigm which provides a distinct measure of each process and apply it to people with focal epilepsy, a condition associated with hippocampal dysfunction, comparing them with healthy young and older participants. Pattern separation and pattern completion were observed in healthy younger individuals. A specific deficit in pattern completion was identified in people with focal epilepsy, while the healthy older cohort showed degraded ability to perform pattern separation. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we simulated human performance using an auto-associative neural network. Modelling indicated that disruption in different populations of neurons could explain the observed memory profiles. These findings show that pattern separation and pattern completion are distinct processes that can be measured from a single behavioural task and are differentially affected by focal epilepsy and aging."
"DNA-encoded library (DEL) technology has become a powerful tool in modern drug discovery. Fully harnessing its potential requires the use of advanced computational methodologies, which are often available only through proprietary software. This limitation restricts flexibility and accessibility for academic researchers and small biotech companies, hindering the growth of the technology. Here, we present DELi, an open-source DEL informatics platform designed for library design, NGS decoding and calling, and enrichment analysis. To showcase its capabilities, we used DELi to design an in-house custom library (UNC-DEL006), a benzimidazole-based DEL, and performed proof-of-concept selection experiments against Bromodomain-containing Protein 4 (BRD4). The DELi decoding and analysis modules identified top-performing compounds, leading to the off-DNA synthesis of UNC 002-080, which was confirmed as a nanomolar BRD4 binder via isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). In contrast, a chemically similar compound not prioritized by DELi, UNC 002-083, showed no measurable binding. These results demonstrate DELi as an effective tool for DEL design and analysis. Further, its open-source nature will promote ongoing development and contributions from the DEL community to expand its applications and capabilities.

"To provide a stable percept of the surface color of objects, the visual system needs to account for variation in illumination chromaticity. This ability is called color constancy. The details of how the visual system disambiguates effects of illumination and reflectance on the light reaching the eye are still unclear. Here we asked how independent illumination and reflectance judgments are of each other, whether color constancy depends on explicitly identifying the illumination chromaticity, and what kinds of contextual cues support this identification. We studied the simultaneous identification of illumination and reflectance changes with realistically rendered, abstract 3D-scenes. Observers were tasked to identify both of these changes between sequentially presented stimuli. The stimuli included a central object whose reflectance could vary, and a background that only varied due to changes in illumination chromaticity. We manipulated the visual cues available in the background: local contrast and specular highlights. We found that identification of illumination and reflectance changes was not independent: While reflectance changes were rarely mis-identified as illumination changes, illumination changes clearly biased reflectance judgments. However, correct identification of reflectance changes was also not fully dependent on correctly identifying the illumination change: Only when there was no illumination change in the stimulus did it lead to better color constancy, that is, correctly identifying the reflectance change. Discriminability of illumination changes did not vary based on available visual of local contrast or specular highlights. Yet discriminability of reflectance changes was improved with local contrast, and to a lesser extent with specular highlights, in the stimulus. We conclude that a failure of color constancy does not depend on a failure to identify illumination changes, but additional visual cues still improve color constancy through better disambiguation of illumination and reflectance changes."
"Tactile signals arising on ones own body allow estimation of ones own sensory state and foster interactions with the environment. However, tactile perception can be influenced by various factors. For instance, tactile perception is suppressed on a moving limb compared to when it is resting, a phenomenon termed tactile suppression. Here we examine whether tactile perception during resting and during movement is robust over shorter and longer time intervals. Participants had to detect tactile stimuli of various intensities on their index finger while this finger was resting or moving (finger extension). This detection task was performed on four sessions at separate days across a period of one month. We found that tactile perception during resting is robust within single sessions and across days. However, tactile perception during movement changed across days, but these changes lacked a clear systematic pattern. We further show that temporal changes in perception alone cannot fully account for the previously reported tactile suppression effects. Finally, split-half correlations reveal high consistency in the estimated perceptual measures, demonstrating that estimates of tactile perception are robust across measurement points."
"Muscle atrophy occurs during physiological (i.e., fasting, aging) and pathological (i.e., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cancer) conditions and anticipates death. Since not all patients will undergo muscle wasting, it would be highly useful to identify them soon to intervene early. We have studied the promoters/enhancers of a subset of atrophy-related genes or atrogenes upregulated in muscles of rodents during various kinds of atrophy (i.e., disuse, diabetes, cancer, fasting, uremia) for their ability to induce early atrophy. Comparing their upstream non-coding regions, using as backbone MuRF1 promoter (one of the earliest muscle-specific genes induced by wasting), we cloned various promoters upstream of a doubled reporter system (FLuciferase/tdTomato). Through in vitro and in vivo studies in mice subjected to denervation or cancer injection, we selected a sequence (i.e., MyoRep) able to predict atrophy upon cut of the sciatic nerve or cancer. In vivo imaging of MyoRep mice emit a bioluminescent signal earlier than muscle loss. Importantly, MyoRep was unable to sense atrophy during fasting or physiological variations following the circadian rhythms. Since MyoRep can discriminate muscle loss due to pathological conditions from physiological ones anticipating wasting, it represents an unprecedented tool to predict it early in various diseases with local or systemic atrophy."
"BackgroundA high-fat diet (HFD) (which contains palmitate) is the primary factor for dietinduced obesity. Lack of sleep leads to the selection of HFD to maintain wakefulness. Sleep deprivation, along with HFD, induces obesity by leptin resistance. The sleep hormone melatonin secreted at night is responsible for the sleep-wake cycle based on circadian rhythm. It has various other functions in the central and peripheral axes, including food intake and energy expenditure. Primarily, melatonin regulates intracellular signaling via its receptors MT1 and MT2 (GPCR) in the cell membrane and can directly enter the cytoplasm.

AimTo study the role of melatonin and its receptor-mediated signaling in palmitate-induced obesity and leptin resistance using the 3T3-L1 cell line.

MethodsLipid accumulation was induced in differentiated 3T3-L1 cell lines by sodium palmitate (0.8 mM). Further, we exposed the cells to melatonin (1 mM) and melatonin receptor inhibitors (luzindole/and 4P-PDOT). Lipid accumulation and melatonins effect were studied using thin-layer chromatography and oil-red O staining, and the mRNA and protein expression of lipid-synthesizing genes and lipases were analyzed using qRT-PCR and western blotting. Leptin secretion was quantified by ELISA assay. Calcium imaging was done by Fura2-AM fluorescent staining.

ResultsPalmitate induction in differentiated 3T3-L1 cell line elevated triacylglycerol (TAG) in lipid droplets along with an increase in the mRNA expression of PPAR{gamma}, SREBP1c, FASN, ACC1, and leptin secretion but decreased the lipases (HSL and ATGL) and PI3K and AKT. Treatment with melatonin restored the TAG level, lipid droplet size, and gene expression of PPAR{gamma}, SREBP1c, FASN, and ACC1, as well as leptin secretion, but increased protein expression of lipases. Melatonin receptor inhibitors, along with palmitate and melatonin, reversed the positive effects of melatonin on fat accumulation and leptin resistance. Intracellular calcium levels were reduced with palmitate induction, and melatonin rescued the calcium level equal to the control group through its receptor signaling. Melatonin restores the mRNA expression of PI3K and AKT genes in palmitate-induced conditions via its receptors.

ConclusionMelatonin is vital for hormonal regulation and energy metabolism, including obesity and leptin secretion. Studying the role of melatonin in leptin regulation and lipid metabolism will help us combat the pathologies of obesity caused by HFD. From our study, the action of melatonin against lipid accumulation and the regulation of leptin secretion is mediated through its receptors MT1 and MT2 by activating the downstream PI3k/AKT signaling.

"Odor cues in nature are sparse and highly fluctuating due to turbulent transport. To investigate how animals perceive these intermittent cues, we developed a behavioral task in which head-restrained mice made binary decisions based on the total number of discrete odor pulses presented stochastically over several seconds. Mice readily learned this task, and their performance was well-described by widely used decision models. Logistic regression of binary choices against the timing of odor pulses within the respiratory cycle revealed that mice placed higher perceptual weight to stimuli arriving during inhalation than exhalation, a phase dependency that strongly correlated with the magnitude of responses in olfactory sensory neurons. The population response of anterior piriform cortex (APCx) neurons to odor pulses was also modulated by respiration phase, although individual neurons displayed varying levels of phase-dependence. Single APCx neurons responded stochastically and transiently to odor pulses, leading to a representation that carries signatures of sensory evidence, but not its accumulation. Our study reveals that mice can integrate intermittent odor signals across dozens of breaths, but respiratory modulation of sensory inputs imposes limits on information acquisition that cortical circuits cannot overcome to improve behavior."
"Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is well known for its unique morphology, physiology, and enzootic lifecycle. Building on previous work that showed peptide transport is essential for viability, we endeavored to more clearly define the impact of peptide starvation on the spirochete and directly compare peptide starvation to targeted free amino acid starvation. Herein, we confirm the ability of a putative GltP, BB0401, to facilitate transport of glutamate and aspartate as well as demonstrate its requirement for cell growth and motility. Using conditional mutants for both peptide transport and BB0401, we characterize these systems throughout the enzootic cycle, both confirming their essential role during murine infection and revealing that they are, surprisingly, dispensable during prolonged colonization of the tick midgut. We broadly define the metabolic perturbations resulting from these amino acid starvation models and show that, even under the most severe amino acid stress, B. burgdorferi is unable to modulate its physiological response via the canonical (p)ppGpp-driven stringent response."
"Ultra-high resolution 3D single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) traditionally requires complex dual-objective lenses (4Pi) configurations to enhance axial (z) precision through interferometry. Here we present a streamlined chip-based alternative, Silicon-assisted interferometric Localization Microscopy (SiLM), which achieves comparable performance using a single-objective lens design. By combining tunable axial structured illumination field, arising from surface-generated excitation interference, with asynchronous interferometry, SiLM enhances axial localization precision to approximately twice that of the lateral (xy), comparable to 4Pi-based methods. Additionally, SiLM provides intrinsic axial self-referencing, offering dramatically improved robustness against mechanical drift. Our method is readily implementable on standard SMLM-capable microscopes and supports a broad range of applications including dual-color imaging, extended-depth imaging, and live-cell 3D single-molecule tracking. Using SiLM, we demonstrate accurate mapping of the stratified nanoscale architecture of integrin-based focal adhesions, establishing it as a powerful and accessible method for high-precision 3D structural cell biology."
"Protein phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism in circadian systems. TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1(TOC1) is a core transcriptional repressor in the plant circadian system that is phosphorylated near its N-terminus. Phenotype testing of single and multi-phosphosite mutants shows incomplete rescue of the short period toc1 mutant. We establish that TOC1 phosphorylation (particularly at S175) is necessary for optimal interaction with FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3) and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 5 (PIF5) at the CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) promoter to downregulate CCA1 expression. At the same time, expression of the closely related LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) also requires TOC1, but is independent of the TOC1 phosphorylation state, suggesting different TOC1-dependent mechanisms in the repression of these two genes. We additionally show how phosphorylation-dependent interactions of TOC1 at specific clock gene promoters selectively regulate these circadian system components more acutely than non-rhythmic genes. Our genome-wide analysis shows that the phosphostate of TOC1 is important for optimal chromatin presence and robust rhythmic gene expression."
"Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are non-coding DNA sequences that modulate gene expression. Their identification is critical to study the transcriptional regulation of genes controlling key traits that govern plant growth and development. They are also crucial components for the delineation of gene regulatory networks, which represent regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes. In maize, CREs have been profiled using different computational and experimental methods, but the extent to which these methods complement each other in identifying functional CREs is unclear. Here, we report the data-driven integration of different maize CRE profiling methods to optimize the capture of experimentally-confirmed TF binding sites, resulting in maps of integrated CREs (iCREs) showing increased levels of completeness and precision. We combined the iCREs with a wide diversity of gene expression data under drought conditions to perform motif enrichment and infer drought-specific GRNs. Mining these organ-specific GRNs revealed known and novel candidate regulators of maize drought response, and showed these networks significantly overlap with drought eQTL regulatory interactions. Furthermore, by studying the transposable elements (TEs) overlapping with iCREs, we identified few TE superfamilies displaying typical epigenetic features of regulatory DNA that are potentially involved in wiring specific TF-target gene regulatory interactions. Overall, our study showcases the integration of different omics data sources to generate a high-quality collection of CREs, together with their applicability to better characterize gene regulation in the complex maize genome."
"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that specifically recognize cell surface glycans associated with cancer and infectious disease hold tremendous value for both basic research and clinical applications. However, high-quality anti-glycan mAbs, especially those with sufficiently high affinity and specificity, remain scarce, highlighting the need for protein engineering approaches based on rational design or directed evolution that enable optimization of antigen-binding properties. To this end, we sought to enhance the affinity of a polysialic acid (polySia)-specific antibody called mAb735, which was raised by animal immunization and possesses only modest affinity, using a combination of rational design and directed evolution. The application of these approaches led to the discovery of affinity-matured IgG variants with up to [~]7-fold stronger affinity for polySia relative to the parental antibody. The higher affinity IgG variants were observed to opsonize polySia- positive cancer cells more avidly, which in turn resulted in significantly greater cytotoxicity as determined by both antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assays. Collectively, these results demonstrate the effective application of both rational and random molecular evolution techniques to an important anti-glycan antibody, providing insights into its carbohydrate recognition while at the same time uncovering variants with greater therapeutic promise due to their enhanced affinity and potency."
"Infants preferentially process familiar social signals, but the neural mechanisms underlying continuous processing of maternal speech remain unclear. Using EEG-based neural encoding models based on temporal response functions, we investigated how 7-month-old infants track maternal vs. unfamiliar speech and whether this affects simultaneous face processing. Infants showed stronger neural tracking of their mothers voice, independent of acoustic properties, suggesting an early neural signature of voice familiarity. Face tracking responses differed depending on the voice infants heard. When listening to a strangers voice, face-tracking accuracy at central electrodes increased with occipital face tracking, suggesting heightened attentional engagement. However, we found no evidence for differential processing of happy vs. fearful faces, contrasting previous findings on early emotion discrimination. Our results reveal interactive effects of voice familiarity on multimodal processing in infancy: while maternal speech enhances neural tracking, it may also alter how other social cues, such as faces, are processed. The findings suggest that early auditory experiences shape how infants allocate cognitive resources to social stimuli, emphasizing the need to consider cross-modal influences in early development.

Significance statementHow infants continuously process familiar social signals and how this familiarity shapes perception has remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that infants brains preferentially track maternal speech over unfamiliar voices, highlighting the early tuning of the auditory system to socially relevant signals. Moreover, the maternal voice modulates the neural encoding of concurrently presented faces--altering the interplay between early visual and attentional processing--without eliciting emotion-specific differences. These findings underscore the role of caregiver signals in shaping multisensory integration during early development."
"The role of the non-immune bone marrow microenvironment (BME) in the transition from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) into clinically active multiple myeloma (MM) remains incompletely defined. To address this, we transcriptionally profiled endothelial cells (EC), mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and MM cells at single-cell resolution from two genetically engineered mouse models (BIc{gamma}1 and MIc{gamma}1) that recapitulate MGUS to MM progression. Our analysis revealed distinct transcriptional trajectories in EC and MSC, uncovering stage-specific BME-PC interactions shaping disease progression. EC acquired a stress phenotype during MGUS transitioning to angiogenesis in MM, while MSC exhibited early impaired differentiation capacity during MGUS that persisted in MM. Notably, an interferon (IFN)-associated MM signature was detected in EC and MSC from the BIc{gamma}1 model but was absent in the more aggressive MIc{gamma}1 model. Treatment with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone remodeled the BME by suppressing MM-IFN signaling, promoting an adaptive response in EC, and restoring osteogenic potential in MSC-- shifting the niche toward a less tumor-permissive state. Importantly, the MM-IFN signature was validated in patients across the MGUS-to-MM spectrum, supporting the translational relevance of our findings. Together, these data define novel dynamic and targetable alterations in the non-immune BME during myeloma progression.

"Glioblastoma is a fatal primary malignant brain tumor, with an average survival of only 15 months despite surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Due to the concurrent deregulation of numerous genes in glioblastoma, molecular monotherapies have not improved clinical outcomes. Evidence suggests that effectively targeting multiple deregulated molecules is essential for better therapies; however, this is limited by the lack of suitable drugs and the increased toxicity of combination therapies. To address this, we hypothesized that miRNAs, small gene-regulatory RNAs that suppress multiple target genes via sequence complementarity, could be developed to inhibit multiple deregulated genes simultaneously, leading to more effective treatments. We identified master regulatory miRNAs--those that target several deregulated genes in glioblastoma--using PAR-CLIP screenings in glioblastoma cells and analyzed TCGA tumor data to find which targets were deregulated. An algorithm ranked these targets based on their significance in glioblastoma malignancy. We selected two tumor suppressor master regulatory miRNAs, miR-340 and miR-382, and one oncogenic miRNA, miR-17. Validation showed that these miRNAs target critical glioblastoma pathways and significantly inhibit cell growth, survival, invasion, and tumor growth in vivo. We developed an innovative therapeutic delivery approach using Brain Penetrating Nanoparticles in combination with MRI-guided focused ultrasound and microbubbles, resulting in reduced tumor volume and extended survival in glioblastoma-bearing mice. This strategy offers a promising pathway for translating miRNA-based therapies into clinical trials for glioblastoma and other cancers.

One Sentence SummaryWe developed and used new computational, experimental, and therapeutic approaches to identify and therapeutically deliver master regulatory miRNAs to inhibit the growth of glioblastoma, the most common and deadly primary brain tumor."
"Mnemonic discrimination (MD) is the ability to distinguish current experiences from similar memories. Research on the brain correlates of MD has focused on how regional neural responses are linked to MD. Here we go beyond this approach to investigate inter-regional functional connectivity patterns related to MD, its inter-individual variability and training-related improvement. Based on prior work we focused on medial temporal lobe (MTL), prefrontal cortex (PFC) and visual regions. We used fMRI to determine how functional connectivity patterns between these regions are related to MD before and after 2-weeks of web-based cognitive training. We identified a functional connectivity signature involving MTL-PFC-visual areas during successful MD. We found that hippocampal-PFC connectivity was negatively associated with interindividual variability in MD performance across two different tasks. Hippocampal-PFC connectivity decrease was also linked to interindividual variability in post-training MD improvement. Additionally, training led to increased connectivity from the lateral occipital cortex to the occipital pole area. Our results point to a hippocampal-PFC connectivity pattern which is a reliable, task-invariant, marker of MD performance. This pattern is further related to MD training gains providing causal evidence for its relevance in distinguishing similar memories. Overall, we show that hippocampal-PFC connectivity constitutes a neural resource for MD that enables training-related improvements and could be targeted in future research to enhance cognition."
"DNA replication and transcription must be intricately coordinated, as both machineries navigate the same chromatin landscape to ensure genome stability and proper cell function. Here, we uncover that a global imbalance between their elongation rates-- specifically, slowed transcriptional elongation alongside rapid replication fork progression--does not elicit replicative stress. Instead, this uncoupling accelerates the acquisition of naive pluripotency during in vitro de-differentiation, revealing an unexpected link between transcription kinetics and cell plasticity. Mechanistically, we show that the transition to naive pluripotency is accompanied by a distinctive alternative splicing program indicative of reduced RNAPII elongation, both in vitro and in vivo. These findings redefine the functional relationship between replication and transcription dynamics and uncover transcriptional velocity as a tunable layer of control over cellular identity transitions.

HighlightsO_LIReplication and transcription elongation rates can be uncoupled genome-wide.
C_LIO_LISlow transcription elongation accelerates the acquisition of naive pluripotency during in vitro de-differentiation.
C_LIO_LIHigh replication fork speed is maintained in slow-transcribing cells during cell state transitions.

"ObjectiveIn the testis of Drosophila, spermatogonia transit-amplification (TA) divisions are necessary for germline proliferation and differentiation. Both the germline and the surrounding somatic cyst cells (SCCs) have a significant influence on these processes. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown.

MethodsFlies were used to generate tissue-specific gene knockdown. Immunofluorescence was used to determine protein localization and expression pattern. Small interfering RNAs were used to knockdown genes in S2 cells. qRT-PCR was used to examine the relative mRNA expression level.

ResultsOur findings indicate that spermatogonial RpS13 regulates cyst cell growth through a non-autonomous manner. In terms of mechanism, RpS13 may regulate the adhesion junctions of the soma-germline via the DE-cad and Arm proteins in addition to dpERK, which is found in SCCs. Interestingly, Rho1 and RpS13 mutually inhibit each other in Drosophila S2 cells. Additionally, Rho1 controlled cell adhesions that rely on DE-cad, Arm, and dpERK and imitated the actions of RpS13 in Drosophila testis.

ConclusionAll of these findings implied that during spermatogonia TA-divisions in the testis of Drosophila, RpS13 regulates the development of cyst cells via Rho1-mediated adhesion junctions."
"Image analysis is a rapidly developing field that provides unique opportunities to characterize and quantify spatial information in images. We study cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), non-coding DNA regions that regulate gene expression, during development using fluorescent reporters in vivo. Characterizing CRM activity during development presents challenges including image segmentation into biologically relevant regions of interest that are not easily distinguishable via common segmentation methods, fluorophore band passing, and variable transfection undermine standardized analysis. To quantify and compare CRM activity levels, we compiled an open-source computer vision tool stack in the form of a Python-based Jupyter notebook and tested four analysis methods to assess their efficacy in quantifying CRM expression in limb development. This Jupyter notebook provides a reproducible, standardized workflow that can be adapted to numerous image analysis applications."
"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has co-evolved with humans for thousands of years causing variation in virulence, transmissibility, and disease phenotypes. To identify bacterial contributors to phenotypic diversity, we developed new RNA-seq and phylogenomic tools to capture hundreds of Mtb isolate transcriptomes, link transcriptional and genetic variation, and find associations between variants and epidemiologic traits. Across 274 Mtb clinical isolates, we uncovered unexpected diversity in expression of virulence genes which we linked to known and previously unrecognized regulators. Surprisingly, we found that many isolates harbor variants associated with decreased expression of EsxA (Esat6) and EsxB (Cfp10), which are virulence effectors, dominant T cell antigens, and immunodiagnostic targets. Across >55,000 isolates, these variants associate with increased transmissibility, especially in drug resistant Mtb strains. Our data suggest expression of key Mtb virulence genes is evolving across isolates in part to optimize fitness under drug pressure, with sobering implications for immunodiagnostics and next-generation vaccines."
"Obesity is associated with increased gut permeability, which contributes to a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. Obesity is also linked with altered neurocognitive functions, including impaired learning and memory. Whether these changes are secondary to neuroinflammation vs. other comorbidities associated with obesity is unknown. Here, we modeled the chronic low-grade inflammation that accompanies diet-induced obesity, but in the absence of obesity or consumption of an obesogenic diet. Male rats were implanted with intraperitoneal osmotic minipumps, continuously dispensing either saline (control) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin produced in the gut that triggers inflammation when in circulation. Immunohistochemistry results revealed that LPS exposure led to neuroinflammation, with an increased number of Ionized Calcium-Binding Molecule 1 (Iba1+) cells in the amygdala and hippocampus in LPS rats vs. controls. Given that these brain regions are associated with impulse control, anxiety-like behavior, and learning and memory, we tested whether chronic LPS treatment impacted these behaviors. Interestingly, LPS exposure did not affect hippocampal-dependent memory in the Morris water maze, novel location recognition, or novel object in context memory tests, suggesting that neuroinflammation in the absence of obesity does not induce memory impairments. Further, chronic LPS significantly decreased anxiety-like behavior in the open field test and food impulsivity in an operant-based procedure. LPS animals also had significantly lower corticosterone and melatonin levels when compared to controls, which may contribute to these behavioral outcomes. These results suggest that the low-grade inflammation associated with obesity is not driving obesity-associated memory impairments but does reduce anxiety and food-motivated impulsive responses.

"Human reads are a key contaminant in microbial metagenomics and enrichment-based studies, requiring removal for computational efficiency, biological analysis, and privacy protection. Various in silico methods exist, but their effectiveness depends on the parameters and reference genomes used. Here, we assess different methods, including the impact of the updated T2T-CHM13 human genome versus GRCh38. Using a synthetic dataset of viral and human reads, we evaluated performance metrics for multiple approaches. We found that the usage of high-sensitivity configuration of Bowtie2 with the T2T-CHM13 reference assembly significantly improves human read removal with minimal loss of specificity, albeit at higher computational cost compared to other methods investigated. Applying this approach to a publicly available microbiome dataset, we effectively removed sex-determining SNPs with little impact on microbial assembly. Our results suggest that our high-sensitivity Bowtie2 approach with the T2T-CHM13 is the best method tested to minimise identifiability risks from residual human reads."
"Spatial proteomics measures multiple proteins in situ, capturing tissue complexity. However, cell classification in densely packed tissues remains challenging due to the lack of efficient classification algorithms, annotation tools, and high-quality labeled datasets to benchmark computational methods. We introduce CellTune, an integrated software for analysis of large spatial proteomics datasets, which streamlines precise cell classification through an optimized human-in-the-loop active learning workflow. It advances core capabilities across within a unified, intuitive, and code-free interface. To evaluate CellTune, we created CellTuneDepot, a resource of 40k manually-annotated cells and 3.5 million high-quality labeled cells across 60 cell types. CellTune outperforms alternative methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human performance while enabling increased classification resolution and discovery of novel cell types. Together, CellTune and CellTuneDepot provide researchers with a tool for state-of-the-art classification accuracy and resolution at scale to drive biological insights."
"Adult zebrafish retinas rely on the resident Muller glia to maintain homeostasis and enable regeneration. Retina regeneration remains incomplete in mammals despite extensive efforts to emulate zebrafish regenerative conditions. Many studies have examined the reprogramming of zebrafish Muller glia cells, which is necessary for regeneration driven by regeneration-associated gene expression. Here, we show that the lncRNA malat1, crucial for many biological functions, plays essential roles during retina regeneration. We demonstrate that malat1 functions through an Egr-dependent axis, modulated by Wnt, Notch, and TGF-{beta} signaling pathways, and is necessary for effective retina regeneration. Moreover, we uncover that the antisense lncRNA talam1, which regulates malat1 availability, is differentially regulated in zebrafish and mice, highlighting species-specific gene regulatory mechanisms after retinal injury. Cells with active TGF-{beta} signaling stabilize Malat1 in mice while the same signaling destabilizes malat1 in zebrafish. Taken together, our work uncovers a new role for the malat1/Egr1 axis in necessitating retina regeneration, which may have important implications for differential regenerative ability in vertebrates."
"Synapses in the nervous system show considerable volatility, raising the question of how the brain maintains functional stability despite continuous synaptic motility. Previous studies have suggested that functionality may be maintained by an ongoing process of activity-dependent plasticity. Here, we address this question in the context of rhythmogenesis. Specifically, we investigated the hypothesis that rhythmic activity in the brain can develop and be stabilized via activity-dependent plasticity in the form of spike-timing-dependent-plasticity (STDP), extending our previous work that demonstrated rhythmogenesis in a toy model of two effective neurons. We examined STDP dynamics in large recurrent networks in two stages. We first derived the effective dynamics of the order parameters of the synaptic connectivity. Then, a perturbative approach was applied to investigate stability. We show that for a wide range of parameters STDP can induce rhythmogenesis. Moreover, STDP can suppress synaptic fluctuations that disrupt functionality. Interestingly, STDP can channel fluctuations in the synaptic weights into a manifold on which the network activity is not affected, thus, maintaining functionality while allowing a subspace in which synaptic weights can be widely distributed."
"The receptive field (RF) of visual cortical neurons is highly dynamic and context-dependent, shaped by both the spatial and temporal properties of stimuli and the complex architecture of cortical circuits. While classical RF mapping through extracellular recordings reveals only the area triggering spiking responses, intracellular recordings reveal a much broader region of subthreshold synaptic input. We investigated how neurons in different cortical layers integrate visual input across space, with a focus on the linearity of spatial summation. Using intracellular recordings, we found that supragranular complex cells integrate input in a highly sublinear manner, in contrast to infragranular complex cells and simple cells, which exhibited near-linear summation. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we employed a large-scale recurrent spiking model of cat primary visual cortex (V1). Modeling results point to the differential patterning of long-range horizontal connections--particularly their targeting of excitatory versus inhibitory neurons--as a potential source of the observed layer-specific integration properties. These findings suggest that RFs emerge from interaction of feedforward, horizontal, and possibly feedback inputs, that are continuous in space, challenging the conventional notions of fixed spatial RF boundaries in early visual processing.

O_LIThe properties of receptive fields (RF) of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) are not static but change depending on spatiotemporal properties of visual stimulus.
C_LIO_LITo study spatial integration of visual information by V1 neurons in a RF independent way, we made intracellular recordings across the cat V1 in response to drifting gratings confined to either circular apertures of variable diameters (disks), or in annuli with fixed outer diameters and variable inner diameters (rings).
C_LIO_LIWe find that supragranular complex cells integrate input in a sublinear manner, whereas infragranular complex cells and simple cells exhibit near-linear summation.
C_LIO_LIOur large-scale recurrent spiking model shows that these differences between supragranular and infragranular complex cells can be explained by laminar differences in horizontal connectivity properties.
C_LIO_LIThese results highlight the substantial differences in spatial integration of visual information at different stages of visual processing

Actual versions of hifiasm often produce unbalanced haplotype contigs for autopolyploid genome assemblies. Adding a contraint on the distribution of proteins among haplotypes improves haplotype sizes and busco scores balances. Four species were used to benchmark this approach against hifiasm raw results.

"Fusobacteria are commensal members of the oral microbiome that can spread from their primary niche and colonize distal sites in the human body. Their enrichment in colorectal and breast cancer tissue has been associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and chemotherapeutic resistance. The use of non-selective antibiotics to remove fusobacteria impairs tumor progression, but prolonged application risks side effects such as gastrointestinal problems and dysbiosis. Species-specific antisense antibiotics based on peptide nucleic acid (PNA) have shown efficacy in many Gram-negative species, suggesting that antisense PNAs may also enable a tailored depletion of fusobacteria. Here, we have investigated the antibacterial potential of cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)-PNA conjugates targeting the mRNA of putative essential genes in Fusobacterium nucleatum. Unexpectedly, we observed no growth inhibition with any of the target-specific PNAs, but identified a non-targeting control CPP-PNA (FUS79, (RXR)4XB-GACATAATTGT) as a potent growth inhibitor of F. nucleatum. Our data suggest that the CPP and specific sequence features of FUS79 are responsible for its activity, rather than an antisense effect. Interestingly, FUS79 also inhibits the growth of five additional fusobacterial strains but not of F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (FNV). RNA-seq analysis indicates that FUS79 induces a membrane stress response in a vulnerable F. nucleatum strain but not in FNV. Collectively, our attempt at developing antisense antibiotics for fusobacteria discovers a potent growth inhibitor, whose bactericidal effect appears independent of target-specific mRNA inhibition.

IMPORTANCEEnrichment of F. nucleatum at cancer sites is associated with increased tumor growth and metastasis. Antibiotic treatment to remove the bacteria was shown to change the course of cancer progression. Here we explore first steps to establish peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) as specific antisense antibiotics, thereby laying the foundation for further development of antisense technology in fusobacteria. While the CPP-PNA FUS79 was initially designed as a control, we observed that the compound was bactericidal for specific fusobacterial strains. Our results suggest that FUS79 might be able to selectively deplete fusobacterial strains from bacterial communities, offering a new perspective on fusobacterial removal at the tumor site."
"We develop a framework for understanding indirect assortative mating and provide updated definitions of key terms. We then develop family models that use partners of twins and siblings to freely estimate the degree of genetic and social homogamy, and account for it when investigating sources of parent-offspring similarity. We applied the models to educational attainment using 1,545,444 individuals in 212,070 extended families in the Norwegian population and Norwegian Twin Registry. Partner similarity in education was better explained by indirect assortment than direct assortment on observed educational attainment, with social homogamy being particularly important. The implied genotypic partner correlation (r=.34) was comparable to earlier studies, and higher than expected under direct assortment. About 38% of the parent-offspring correlation (r=.34) was attributable to various forms of environmental transmission. Alternative models that assumed direct assortment estimated environmental transmission to be lower, but these did not fit the data well."
"The development of therapies and vaccines targeting integral membrane proteins has been complicated by their extensive hydrophobic surfaces, which can make production and structural characterization difficult. Here we describe a general deep learning-based design approach for solubilizing native membrane proteins while preserving their sequence, fold, and function using genetically encoded de novo protein WRAPs (Water-soluble RFdiffused Amphipathic Proteins) that surround the lipid-interacting hydrophobic surfaces, rendering them stable and water-soluble without the need for detergents. We design WRAPs for both beta-barrel outer membrane and helical multi-pass transmembrane proteins, and show that the solubilized proteins retain the binding and enzymatic functions of the native targets with enhanced stability. Syphilis vaccine development has been hindered by difficulties in characterizing and producing the outer membrane protein antigens; we generated soluble versions of four Treponema pallidum outer membrane beta barrels which are potential syphilis vaccine antigens. A 4.0 [A] cryo-EM map of WRAPed TP0698 is closely consistent with the design model. WRAPs should be broadly useful for facilitating biochemical and structural characterization of integral membrane proteins, enabling therapeutic discovery by screening against purified soluble targets, and generating antigenically intact immunogens for vaccine development."
"Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are key mediators of lung function and are potential targets for therapies during respiratory infections. TGF{beta} is an important regulator of AM differentiation and maintenance, but how TGF{beta} directly modulates the innate immune responses of AMs remains unclear. This shortcoming prevents effective targeting of AMs to improve lung function in health and disease. Here we leveraged an optimized ex vivo AM model system, fetal-liver derived alveolar-like macrophages (FLAMs), to dissect the role of TGF{beta} in AMs. Using transcriptional analysis, we first globally defined how TGF{beta} regulates gene expression of resting FLAMs. We found that TGF{beta} maintains the baseline metabolic state of AMs by driving lipid metabolism through oxidative phosphorylation and restricting inflammation. To better understand inflammatory regulation in FLAMs, we next directly tested how TGF{beta} alters the response to TLR2 agonists. While both TGF{beta} (+) and TGF{beta} (-) FLAMs robustly responded to TLR2 agonists, we found an unexpected activation of type I interferon (IFN) responses in FLAMs and primary AMs in a TGF{beta}-dependent manner. Surprisingly, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein and the interferon regulator factors 3 and 7 were required for IFN production by TLR2 agonists and the IFN response was dependent on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Together, these data suggest that TGF{beta} modulates AM metabolic networks and innate immune signaling cascades to control inflammatory pathways in AMs."
"Siphonophores (Cnidaria:Hydrozoa) are pelagic colonial marine invertebrates with many highly specialized bodies (zooids) within a single colony. Their unique biology and ecological importance have made them of particular interest. Recent work revealed siphonophore genomes to be larger than in most other cnidarians. To investigate siphonophores genome biology and develop resources for future studies, we sequenced the genome of a single Nanomia septata to chromosome scale. The haploid genome is 1.5GB across 8 chromosomes, a reduction relative to the 15 chromosomes seen in closely related hydrozoan genomes, and is highly rearranged, consistent with multiple mixing events. Genome expansion occurred through intergenic repeat expansion, with protein-coding genes shorter than in most cnidarians. We found no genomic features clearly associated with siphonophores exceptional colony-level complexity. Gene families that play critical roles in cnidarian development have not expanded, and gene proximity was not generally correlated to their expression across zooids, except in male gonophores. To contextualize these observations, we genome sequenced 20 additional Nanomia specimens across the globe and mapped them to our chromosome-scale reference. Population genomic analyses support three previously recognized species of Nanomia, and at least one additional undescribed species. Overlapping geographic distribution of some Nanomia species suggest reproductive isolation in sympatry. Phylogenetic analyses of genome size indicate Nanomia septata and Nanomia cara have similarly large genomes between 1.5-1.7GB, while Nanomia bijuga and an undescribed species show a secondary reduction to 0.7GB. These results highlight how genomic factors have shaped colony organization and genome diversity within Nanomia."
"Here we describe Vepris wadigo based on new collections and observations of the informally published Diphasia sp. A of the Flora of Tropical East Africa. Vepris wadigo is known with certainty only from Kaya Kinondo and Kaya Timbwa forests in Kwale District of coastal Kenya where it is known as Mchikoma (Digo language). A sterile specimen from the Usambara Mts of Tanzania suggests that the species may also occur there, but this needs verification with a fertile specimen.

Vepris wadigo is compared with the only other known diphasoid Vepris species of East Africa, Vepris morogoroensis of Tanzania. However, Vepris wadigo most closely resembles Vepris stolzii of Tanzania which differs in the 4-locular fruit.

The chemistry of Vepris wadigo is unique among the African species of Vepris which have been analysed, since acridones, quinolines and limonoids which characterise the genus were not detected. The six compounds which were characterised included compound 1 a benzamide newly described and named in this paper as wadigin (N-(2,6-dihydroxybenzoyl)-O-methyltyramine) which is an O-glucosylated derivative of riparin III, and four lignans and neolignans not previously found or very unusual in Vepris, namely heterotropan (2), asaraldehyde (3) a degradation product of compound 4, E-asarone (4) and its isomer, Z- asarone (5). Finally, Lupeol (compound 6) which has previously been found in African Vepris.

Vepris wadigo is here provisionally assessed as Endangered, EN B1ab(i-iii)+B2ab(i-iii) since only two threat-based locations are known, with an area of occupation of 8 km2 using the IUCN preferred 4 km2 cell size, although the actual total area of the habitat occupied is 22.57 Ha as calculated with Google Earth Pro. Since there are only two points the extent of occurrence cannot be calculated. Satellite imagery has shown that the area of the habitat has slowly decreased in recent decades."
"Non-resolving bacterial infections involve biofilm formation and are often complicating treatments. Utilizing lytic bacteriophages with antibiotics holds promise in biofilm eradication. Accurately matching phage-antibiotic combinations against target bacteria, termed Clinical Phage Microbiology (CPM), is crucial in effective phage therapy treatments. However, compared to planktonic cultures, performing CPM on biofilm infections poses a significant challenge due to the lack of effective methods and a standard protocol. This study compared various CPM approaches in biofilms. To this end, the activity of five phages was assessed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms using nine methods and multiple approaches. Here, we discuss various aspects of each technique, including sensitivity, duration, ease of implementation in diagnostic labs, and labor. Finally, we offer a preliminary protocol for testing phage-sensitivity in biofilm, which was tested on various bacteria species, and may serve as a basis for comprehensive CPM in biofilm."
"The N400 component of ERPs is modulated by how predictable a word is, but predictability is usually quantified with lexical cloze--the probability that readers supply that exact word in offline sentence completion tasks. This form-based metric is at odds with decades of evidence that the N400 is primarily sensitive to meaning. Here, we asked whether a measure of semantic feature predictability can better account for N400 amplitude modulation. We reanalysed two independent EEG datasets (N = 26 and N = 334), computing lexical and semantic cloze for each critical word. Across the two datasets, semantic cloze explained significantly more N400 variance than lexical cloze. Using the same materials, we then compared semantic and lexical cloze with probabilities from four large language models (GPT-2, GPT-2.7b, RoBERTa, ALBERT). None of the LLM-derived predictors outperformed semantic cloze. Our findings support the view that the N400 primarily reflects semantic--not exact-word--processing. Methodologically, we argue that replacing lexical cloze with semantic cloze can substantially increase the explanatory power of N400 studies, and caution against substituting human norms with raw LLM probabilities."
"BackgroundThere is a critical need for management of vascularization in bone tissue engineering. The purpose of this study was to use HIF-1-transduced BMSCs fabricated prevascularized osteogenic cell sheets and explore HIF-1 promoted osteogenic-angiogenic coupling response of BMSCs cell sheets in vitro.

MethodsHIF-1 was over-expressed by using a lentiviral vector, and transduced steadily in Wistar rats bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells(BMSCs). Real-time quantitative and western blot were performed to assess the expression level of HIF-1. Then, HIF-1/BMSCs were cultured to form osteogenic cell sheets(OCTs). ALP activity and Alizarin-red staining were performed respectively at day 14 and 21 to detect the characteristic of osteogenesis. Simultaneously, HIF-1/BMSCs were induced to differentiate into endothelial-like cells(iECs) for 14 days, and flow cytometry was further detected the conversion rates of HIF-1/BMSCs to iECs. Finally, iECs were seeded onto the OCTs to construct the prevascularized-osteogenic cell sheets (P-OCTs). In order to detect the role of HIF-1 involved in osteogenic-angiogenic coupling response of P-OCTs, Immunofluorescent staining for CD31 was performed on P-OCTs at 1, 3, 7, 14 days to check the formation of networks, and western blot of osteopontin(OPN) and osteocalcin (OCN) at 1, 7, 14 days to detect bone formation. Meanwhile, the none transduced BMSCs were as control.

ConclusionBMSCs were transduced by Lenti-HIF-1 with optimal multiplicity of infection was 30(MOI=30), meanwhile, qPCR and western blot were performed to confirm this result. Next, the flow cytometric analysis results showed the conversion rate of BMSCs differentiated to iECs was 92.43%, which indicated BMSCs transduced by HIF-1 had a great superiority to differentiate into endothelial cells under experimental conditions. Then, ALP at day 14 and Alizarin-red staining at day 21 on OCTs showed an obvious osteogenic differentiation characteristic with more deep stained calcium nodules deposits than the control groups. Finally, we fabricated P-OCTs and observed iECs migrated reticulated fast and formed a large number of lumens and networks in experimental groups. At the same time, the results of Immunofluorescent staining for CD31 at day 1, 3, 7, 14 and osteogenic proteins expressions of OCN,OPN at day 1, 7, 14 showed that HIF-1 could promote osteogenic-angiogenic coupling response in P-OCTs significantly in vitro. All in all, the over-expressed HIF-1 of BMSCs cell sheets strategy can provide a new promising method for bone engineering, and we will detect further in vivo."
"MotivationThe growing availability of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data highlights the necessity for robust integration methods to uncover both shared and unique cellular features across samples. These datasets often exhibit technical variations and biological differences, complicating integrative analyses. While numerous integration methods have been proposed, many fail to account for individual-level covariates or are limited to discrete variables.

ResultsTo address these limitations, we propose scINSIGHT2, a generalized linear latent variable model that accommodates both continuous covariates, such as age, and discrete factors, such as disease conditions. Through both simulation studies and real-data applications, we demonstrate that scINSIGHT2 accurately harmonizes scRNA-seq datasets, whether from single or multiple sources. These results highlight scINSIGHT2s utility in capturing meaningful biological insights from scRNA-seq data while accounting for individual-level variation.

Availability and implementationThe scINSIGHT2 method has been implemented as an R package, which is available at https://github.com/yudimu/scINSIGHT2/."
"Holistic processing has traditionally been regarded as unique to faces, attributed to the spatial layout across facial features and their variability across individuals. However, whether such processing can occur in stimuli other than faces has remained an open and contentious question. Here, we show that novel non-face stimuli, which are designed to be differentiated strictly by configural properties, can drive holistic processing effects, while similar non-configural stimuli do not generate these effects. Using novel, abstract stimuli that isolate configural information, we systematically examined four effects typically associated with holistic face perception: the inversion, part-whole, composite, and misalignment effects. We observed all four effects with these stimuli, suggesting that this special form of visual processing extends beyond the realm of faces, and primarily requires that stimuli contain configural information for accurate classification. These effects manifested with minimal training, demonstrating that the visual system can rapidly integrate spatial relationships. Furthermore, convolutional neural networks, trained to categorize these stimuli, also show these effects, and like humans, these effects are only observed with the configural stimuli, and not with the non-configural stimuli. Our results challenge the traditional view of holistic processing as face-specific, and propose that configural processing itself serves as a primary driver of holistic perception and may be a fundamental visual process of its own."
"The study of viral quasispecies structure and diversity presents unique challenges in comparing samples, particularly when dealing with single observations of single biosamples, taken from different time points or conditions. Traditional statistical methods are often inapplicable in these scenarios, where a biosample observation is represented by a vector of haplotypes and associated frequencies, necessitating the use of resampling techniques to empirically generate haplotype distributions from which estimate estimate expected values and corresponding variability. The authors propose a random delete-d jackknife to estimate standard errors followed by a z-test for comparing single quasispecies observations. The research highlights several key challenges in quasispecies analysis, including the need for high sequencing depth, limited clinical samples, technical inconsistencies leading to coverage disparities, and the sensitivity of diversity indices to sample size differences. To address these issues, the authors suggest using a combination of metrics with varying susceptibilities to large sample sizes, ranging from observed differences and ratios to multitest adjusted p-values. The paper emphasizes the importance of not relying solely on p-values, as the high statistical power resulting from large sample sizes can lead to very low p-values for small, potentially biologically insignificant differences."
"The hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus thrives in extreme temperatures and exhibits a complex response to heat shock. However, the regulatory dynamics of genetic information during heat shock remain poorly understood. In this study, we exposed P. furiosus (cultured at 90{degrees}C) to acute heat shock by boiling (101-102{degrees}C) and analyzed its transcriptomic and proteomic responses. The levels of 16S and 23S rRNAs and of total tRNA were decreased by approximately 50%, and pre-tRNA splicing was inhibited, indicating suppression of translation. By contrast, approximately 90% of the proteome remained stable, underscoring the robustness of existing proteins. However, the transcriptome exhibited widespread alterations with limited correlation to the proteome (correlation coefficient r = 0.32), except for a few key proteins. These proteins included PF1883 (small heat shock protein), PF1385 (uracil-DNA glycosylase), and PF1616 (inositol-1-phosphate synthase), which are involved in protein chaperoning, stress-related metabolite synthesis, and DNA repair, respectively. Additionally, PF0624, previously annotated as a hypothetical protein, was identified as a putative histone motif-containing protein. Experimental evidence suggests that PF0624 may contribute to chromatin formation via archaeal histones in P. furiosus. In summary, our findings reveal that P. furiosus responds to acute heat shock by maintaining protein stability, suppressing translation, limiting genomic damage, and potentially compacting genomic DNA into archaeal chromatin.

IMPORTANCEHyperthermophilic archaea, such as Pyrococcus furiosus, thrive in extreme environments where the temperatures may reach up to 100{degrees}C. However, the precise mechanisms by which these organisms protect their genomic DNA from heat-induced damage remain incompletely understood. In this study, we propose that PF0624, a histone-like protein that is transcriptionally induced and translated in response to acute heat shock, is critical in stabilizing archaeal chromatin structure through histone-mediated mechanisms. Our results highlight the sophisticated molecular strategies employed by P. furiosus to survive extreme thermal stress."
"Synaptic pruning, especially in the cerebellum, is a dominant process of circuit assembly, known to eliminate a large proportion of synapses formed during development. Yet, very little is understood about how the drastic elimination of a large number of synapses affects circuit computation and behavior. Zebrafish are an ideal model organism to address this question as they undergo cerebellar maturation while navigating complex aqueous environments. Here, we first establish the timelines of synaptic pruning in the olivocerebellar climbing fiber (CF) to Purkinje neuron (PN) synapses of larval zebrafish. We then show that during this window, CF to PN inputs show improvements in encoding of sensori-motor mismatches, tuning of sensory representations and more robust predictive signals. Concomitant with these changes, larval visuomotor behaviors are faster and better adaptable to current sensory input. We propose that developmental synaptic pruning makes circuits fit for complex computations such as predictive processing and contributes to improved behavioral performance."
"Brain asymmetry is widely observed in different species. Studies on rodent hippocampi have provided morphological and physiological explanations for left-right asymmetry and have shown that the environment influences hippocampal lateralization in the CA1 region. However, how the left-right asymmetry arises, and its significance are not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the transcriptome profiles of the rat hippocampus associated with lateralization and to assess the sensitivity of the bilateral CA1 region to an enriched environment. Transcriptomic analysis using RNA-seq was performed on the left and right CA1 regions of male rats reared in isolated or enriched environments. Although differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were not found between left and right CA1 under either environmental condition, environment-induced DEGs were significantly detected in both left and right CA1. DEGs common to both hemispheres were also found in the environmental comparison, and immediate early genes were suggested as relevant together with gene co-expression network analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the profiles of gene expression change due to the enriched environment in the bilateral CA1 were significantly enriched in the suppressed direction in several gene sets, including those related to synaptic signaling and organization, and neuronal connection."
"Protein dynamics have emerged as a key feature associated with function in various systems. Here, NMR-based studies coupled with computational cheminformatics and cellular function are leveraged to identify a relationship between the human cold and menthol receptor TRPM8 dynamics, chemical structure, and cellular potency. TRPM8 is a validated target for a variety of pain indications but generally has been clinically limited by on-target side effects impacting thermosensing and thermoregulation. This study shows that cheminformatic analysis of a TRPM8 regulating small molecule ligand library correlates with cellular function. Electrophysiology studies further validate the relationship and show a correlation between chemical structure and functional features such as compound potency. Solution NMR studies of the TRPM8 voltage sensing-like domain, which houses the canonical menthol ligand binding site, show that ligand binding conformationally selects NMR-detected TRPM8 dynamics in a manner that quantitatively correlates with chemical structure. The relationship between chemical structure and protein dynamics can be used predictively, where a chemical structure is predictive of dynamics in a latent reduced dimensionality space. Moreover, the robustness of the conformational selection of the dynamic ensemble is evaluated by varying related and divergent chemotypes, signal-to-noise sensitivity, and sample bias. Taken together, this study identifies that protein dynamics can serve as a quantifiable bridge between chemical structure and cellular function, which has implications for drug discovery in difficult systems."
"Applicable methods of rejuvenating organisms and improving resistance to environmental stimuli are needed. During attempts to synchronize heart rates in unhealthy colonial chordates, we observed morphological rejuvenation. While the importance of endogenously generated bioelectric currents in development is well-established1,2, and exogenously applied current has shown promise in regenerative medicine3,4,5,6,7,8,9, a model that robustly increases longevity and fertility while providing detailed mechanistic insights has not been reported. Here, we report the establishment of such a model using pulsatile electrical current (PEC) in Botryllus schlosseri, an established colonial chordate model10,11,12,13,14,15. PEC treatment significantly improved survival, morphological integrity, stem cell mediated regeneration, and gonad production in Botryllus. Transcriptomic analysis revealed pathway changes associated with cellular metabolism, cell cycle, stem cell activity, DNA repair, and immune modulation. Notably, PEC-induced expression patterns resemble the exercise-induced macrophage-associated transcriptional response previously observed across several mammalian species16,17. This transcriptomic signature correlated with an increase in immune-cell-containing populations. These findings demonstrate that PEC can improve longevity, vitality, and reproduction in an established model renowned for defining broadly applicable biological principles. These studies offer insights into novel strategies for promoting healthy aging and organismal survival."
"O_LIBird seasonal migration is a remarkable biogeographic phenomenon, yet its deep-time origin(s) and evolutionary history remain poorly understood, with the bird fossil record largely overlooked. This study explores the predictability of bird migratory behaviour from the oxygen isotope composition of their bone apatite phosphate ({delta}18Op), a promising approach in this regard because: (i) sedentary and migratory birds tend to occupy distinct climatic niches year-round; (ii) their {delta}18Op values primarily reflect the climate-driven isotopic composition of their drinking water; and (iii) this isotopic signature can persist through fossilisation.
C_LIO_LIBone tissues were categorised based on their potential to yield spatio-temporally distinct climatic records: ""early bone tissues"" (EBT), deposited before somatic maturity, and ""late bone tissues"" (LBT), resulting from bone remodelling events over the lifespan. The predictability of migratory behaviour was theoretically assessed by modelling tissue-specific {delta}18Op values for thousands of birds across 77 migratory and sedentary species, based on their tracking or observational data, using a revised phosphate-water fractionation equation. These theoretical results were confronted with data from 11 extant bird species obtained using a new experimental framework that combines histological and isotopic analyses.
C_LIO_LIWe emphasised that, under specific sampling protocols, a significantly positive correlation between the {delta}18Op value and the proportion of LBT of bone samples is characteristic of long-distance migratory birds. Additionally, migratory birds that perished outside their natal sites can be identified when their {delta}18Op,EBT value falls outside the range observed in local juvenile and sedentary birds.
C_LIO_LIWe conclude that the migratory behaviour of birds can be inferred from the {delta}18Op values of their skeletal remains, with relatively low sensitivity (not all migratory behaviours are detected), but with high specificity (sedentary birds are rarely misclassified as migratory). We argue that the same method can be used to infer past bird migratory behaviours from well-preserved fossil bones, provided the palaeoclimatic context is carefully considered. More broadly, this study establishes a framework for inferring the migratory behaviour of any vertebrate from non-fully remodelled biomineralised remains.

"Melanocytes reside in diverse microenvironments that influence their susceptibility to oncogenic transformation, however, studying rare melanoma subsets has been hindered by the lack of suitable animal models. We developed a primary, immune-competent zebrafish model to study uveal melanoma (UM), utilizing choroidal-targeted injection and electroporation of plasmids containing human GNAQQ209Land CRISPR/Cas9 cassettes for tumor suppressor gene deletion. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of genetically identical eye- and skin-derived tumors revealed distinct oncogenic pathways, highlighting the importance of studying melanoma subtypes in their correct anatomical context. Additionally, we identified a population of tfec- and pax3a-expressing melanocyte progenitor cells in mitfa-deficient embryos and adult zebrafish eyes, which were highly susceptible to GNAQ-driven transformation. While previous studies have linked mitfa deficiency to accelerated UM onset, our findings suggest that an expanded progenitor population in mitfa-deficient animals drives this susceptibility. Our study establishes a critical role for MITF-independent melanocyte progenitors in UM pathogenesis.

"Myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) is caused by CTG repeat expansions in the DMPK gene leading to mRNA toxicity and sequestration of the splicing regulator MBNL1, affecting many tissues. We have developed an in vitro screening platform based on ddPCR and in-cell western to quantify these mRNAs and proteins and characterised more than 20 cell models to define DM1 biomarkers that could be useful for drug screening. DMPK protein levels were reduced in DM1-immortalised myoblasts and myotubes, but not in fibroblasts, while MBNL1 protein was consistently lower in all DM1 myogenic cultures, whether primary or immortalised. Myogenic differentiation of cultures led to an increase in DMPK mRNA expression, which was translated into increased MBNL1 sequestration in foci. We further corroborated the platforms ability to assess therapeutic outcomes, evaluating the effect of a DMPK gapmer ASO and one siRNA: while the gapmer increased MBNL1 protein levels, the siRNA had no significant effect on MBNL1 release. Our platform and the in-depth characterisation of some of the most used models would be of use to the DM1 research community.

Significance statementMyotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) is a multisystemic disease with a complex pathogenesis and multiple outcome measures for drug assessment in vitro. In the last years, the increasing number of new potential therapies targeting DM1 in clinical trials has increased the need for robust and rapid evaluation of preclinical candidates, as well as in-depth knowledge of the cell models used. Here, we present a new cell-based platform that enables robust quantification of DMPK and MBNL1 in cell culture for cell model characterisation and drug screening. Indeed, we highlight the differences observed in DMPK and MBNL1 protein quantification in primary fibroblasts and myotubes, immortalised fibroblasts, myoblasts and myotubes. We then, we performed a proof-of-concept drug evaluation of potential therapeutic strategies targeting DMPK, showing the most suitable for targeting the DMPK expanded transcript."
"In angiosperms, the stigma is the first point of contact between the pollen (male) and pistil (female) during pollination. The stigma facilitates pollen capture and adhesion, compatibility responses, pollen germination, and pollen tube guidance to the transmitting tract. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the stigma is composed of single-celled stigma papillae that initiate from the apex of the carpels. Despite their critical function in plant reproduction, little is known about the cell and molecular mechanisms that govern stigma papillae growth and development. Using morphometric analysis of stigma papillae growth during different stages of floral development, we show that Arabidopsis stigma papillae grow via an anisotropic diffuse growth mechanism. Consistent with this conclusion, vegetative anisotropic growth mutants with defective microtubule and cellulose microfibril organization also have compromised stigma papillae growth."
"Perivascular space (PVS) surrounds the perforating arteries or draining veins of the cerebral cortex as part of the brain clearance system. Previous studies showed that sleep aTects both brain clearance function and brain functional connectivity (FC). However, the impact of PVS characteristics on brain FC remains unclear. This study investigated these associations and their link to cognition. We utilized cross-sectional structural MRI and resting state-fMRI data from 512 health aging population in the HCP-Aging dataset, together with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and NIH cognitive tests. Our results showed that basal ganglia (BG)-PVS volume fraction (VF) was positively correlated with FC in the right anterior medial temporal gyrus (aMTG) and right temporal regions, while centrum-semiovale (CSO)-PVS VF was positively correlated with FC in the left hippocampus and right frontal regions. Increased CSO-PVS VF in early middle-aged adults showed higher hippocampal FC and better cognitive performance. Interestingly, individuals with longer time spent in bed had larger BG-PVS VF linked to higher FC in the right aMTG. Additionally, older adults with better sleep quality had larger BG-PVS VF linked to higher FC in the right aMTG. These findings suggest that PVS morphology may reflect changes in neural connections involved in memory-related regions."
"Display technologies are used extensively in the discovery of peptides and antibodies towards the development of new medicines and diagnostic tools. Phage display technology enables the filtering of <1010 random peptides/antibodies down to and enriched pool of candidates with favourable binding affinities. In recent years, next-generation DNA sequencing technologies have increased the precision and accuracy with which the peptide sequences of phage display library clones are identified. Inaccuracies in DNA sequencing such as substitutions, insertions and deletions in the library oligonucleotide region have the potential to result in the identification of erroneous candidate sequences. Here, we describe a Python Pipeline for Phage Analysis through a Normative Unified Toolset (P3ANUT) which employs Levenshtein distance, k-mer approaches and a novel encoding scheme on paired-end sequencing outputs to correct sequencing errors from next-generation sequencing outputs of display library screens. We introduce an easy-to-use and highly customisable computational tool with graphical user- and command line interfaces to process entire datasets within a single input, as well as visualisation tools for candidate analysis and data generation. P3ANUT shows significant improvements in read recovery, overall read quality, and runtime compared to a previously published pipeline.

"Hyperactive WNT signaling is a potent cancer driver, but clinical translation of WNT inhibitors has been hampered by on-target toxicities. WNT signaling can be constrained through inhibition of the PARP family enzymes Tankyrase 1 (TNKS1) and Tankyrase 2 (TNKS2), however, existing TNKS inhibitors suppress WNT signaling in both tumor and healthy tissues. In this study, we show that the loss of chromosome 8p that occurs in approximately half of advanced epithelial malignancies, creates a collateral vulnerability that enables tumor-selective inhibition of Tankyrase activity. 8p loss depletes expression of TNKS1 and creates a tumor-specific dependency on the functionally redundant TNKS2 protein. Through structure-guided drug design, we identify a first-in-class TNKS2-selective inhibitor that can drive selective WNT inhibition in TNKS1-deficient oncogenic cell and organoid models. This work demonstrates a targetable vulnerability in multiple cancer types, providing a new approach to potent and selective WNT-targeted therapies."
"Balancing selection, a form of selection that maintains genetic diversity, is difficult to detect, and the importance of balancing selection for the maintenance of genetic variation may be larger than often assumed. We use modeling to explore the possibility that the diversity-promoting effects of balancing selection extend to other loci that show sign epistasis with a locus under balancing selection. We delineate the conditions under which this can occur in diploids and find that the recombination rate and the dominance of sign epistasis are key parameters that determine the maintenance of polymorphism beyond the locus under direct balancing selection. We suggest that the effect we explore may play a significant role, especially when balancing selection acts on major effect loci."
"EHEC O157:H7 is responsible for Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) outbreaks in humans and its virulence is associated with Shiga toxin (Stx). During the pathogenesis of HUS, EHEC O157:H7 is phagocytized by the intestinal host macrophage into the phagosome. According to our study, a low percentage of phagocytized bacteria survived in the murine macrophage phagosome. To understand the initials mechanisms involved in bacterial persistence, we performed a global profile of bacterial RNAseq analysis in the early phagosome of murine macrophage and in vitro assays with more extreme stress conditions. The defense strategy of an early murine phagosome consisted on producing DNA damage, membrane damage, acid pH and nitric oxide (NO) agents. These hostile conditions triggering the bacterial SOS response, lipid biosynthesis and NO detoxification enzymes in response to DNA damage, membrane damage and nitric oxide agents, respectively. In turn, to survive, the bacterium conserves energy by downregulating flagellar biosynthesis, T3SS and T6SS virulence mechanisms. In contrast, stx2a expression is upregulated. At the same time, it increases the ribosomal levels and amino acid synthesis to react more effectively against adverse conditions. Under more extreme stress conditions, EHEC O157:H7 expressed genes related to an acidic environment (pH 4.5) upregulating the acid stress response pathways AR2-5, whereas, upon high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, it transcribed higher levels of genes of the OxyR pathway and subsequently hydrogen peroxide oxidative stress-related genes."
"TDP-43 mislocalization, aggregation, and loss of splicing function are neuropathological hallmarks in over 97% of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), 45% of Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD), and 60% of Alzheimers Disease, which has been reclassified as LATE-NC. However, the mechanisms underlying TDP-43 dysfunction remain elusive. Here, we utilize APEX2-driven proximity labeling and mass spectrometry to characterize the context-dependent TDP-43 interactome in conditions of cytoplasmic mislocalization, impaired RNA-binding contributing to aggregation, and oxidative stress. We describe context-dependent interactors, including disrupted interactions with splicing-related proteins and altered biomolecular condensate (BMC) associations. By integrating ALS and FTLD snRNA-seq data, we uncover disease-relevant molecular alterations and validate our dataset through a functional screen that identifies key TDP- 43 regulators. We demonstrate that disrupting nuclear speckle integrity, particularly through the downregulation of the splicing factor SRRM2, promotes TDP-43 mislocalization and loss of function. Additionally, we identify NUFIP2 as an interactor associated with mislocalization that sequesters TDP-43 into cytoplasmic aggregates and co-localizes with TDP-43 pathology in patient tissue. We also highlight HNRNPC as a potent TDP-43 splicing regulator, where precise modulation of TDP-43 or HNRNPC can rescue cryptic exon splicing. These findings provide mechanistic insights and potential therapeutic targets for TDP-43 dysfunction."
"Parental health strongly influences the development of embryos, and can ultimately influence behavior post-birth. When exposed to pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14), C. elegans produces a robust immune response, as well as a learned behavior to avoid PA14 in the future. This learned avoidance of PA14 can be inherited by the F1 generation. An important trigger of the worms immune response to infection is the Nrf2 homologue, SKN-1. We find that the SKN-1B isoform strongly influences the intergenerational inheritance of PA14 avoidance in F1 animals via DAF-7 (TGF-{beta}) signaling from ASI. Functional SKN-1B is required in both the P0 and F1 generations to facilitate F1 avoidance of PA14 due to parental exposure. While inherited avoidance of PA14 was not observed in F2+ generations, the single generation learning investigated here may provide a parallel pathway to improve the fitness of F1 animals in a dynamic environment."
"Drosophila and parasitic wasps in the genus Leptopilina have long been a model for understanding host-parasite interactions. Indeed, parasitic wasps are important drivers of ecological and evolutionary processes broadly, but we are generally lacking information about the diversity, natural history, and evolution of these relationships. We collected insects from the Caribbean Island of Saint Lucia, home to the eastern Caribbean  dunni subgroup of Drosophila: a clade long appreciated for its recent patterns of speciation and adaptation. Here we present an integrative approach that incorporates natural history, taxonomy, physiology, and genomics to describe Leptopilina n. sp. Buffington, Lue, Davis & Tracey sp. nov. (Hymenoptera: Figitidae), a virulent parasitoid of dunni group flies, especially Drosophila antillea. Leptopilina n. sp. is nested within an early-branching clade of Leptopilina, offering insights into the evolution of this important genus of Drosophila parasitoids. We present a high-quality assembly for this wasps 1Gbp genome, and for its bacterial endosymbiont: Wolbachia strain ""wLmal"". Furthermore, we show that wLmal induces parthenogenesis in the wasp, and that these wasps are reliant upon their Wolbachia infections to produce female offspring. Finally, comparison to historical museum specimens indicate that Leptopilina n. sp. had been collected approximately 40 years prior from the nearby island of Guadeloupe and were also asexually reproducing. This work represents one of only a handful of studies in which field biology, taxonomy, systematics, genomics, and experimental biology are integrated into a species description: showcasing the possibilities for biodiversity research in the genomic era."
"Ticks are obligate hematophagous parasites and pathogen vectors responsible for morbidity and mortality worldwide. Ixodes scapularis is a vector for at least seven pathogens relevant to human and animal health including the Lyme disease microbe, Borrelia burgdorferi, and the causative agent of anaplasmosis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Tick-host interactions are a driving influence on the maintenance of tick-borne pathogens in a population. Here, we report that repeated I. scapularis larval infestations on the wild host species Peromyscus leucopus leads to immune-mediated rejection of the tick, a phenomenon termed acquired tick resistance (ATR). We found that over 50% fewer larvae reached repletion and had decreased blood meal weights compared to larvae fed on naive hosts. Additionally, mice exhibited increasingly severe inflammation at tick bite sites characterized by an influx of basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, and T lymphocytes. Larvae fed on sensitized mice ingested higher quantities of host leukocytes when compared to ticks fed on naive hosts, which rarely ingested nucleated cells. When challenged with B. burgdorferi or A. phagocytophilum, larvae fed on sensitized mice ingested more bacteria. Altogether, we demonstrate that reservoir host species develop ATR against larval I. scapularis, which reduces tick feeding success and affects pathogen ingestion by larvae. These results indicate that ATR could impact Ixodes population dynamics, prevalence of infected ticks, and pathogen circulation in the wild."
"Candida auris is an often multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen notorious for persistent skin colonization and transmission in healthcare settings. However, the mechanisms driving its adherence to skin remain poorly understood. Here, we developed in vitro systems to allow for detailed analysis of early skin colonization events and identified critical host and pathogen mediators of attachment. Across multiple strains and clades of C. auris, we identified that Als4112, a conserved adhesin, is required for skin colonization via keratinocyte attachment and direct interactions with host extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, especially basement membrane proteins such as laminin. In a murine epicutaneous infection and human skin explants, deletion of ALS4112 significantly reduced skin colonization, underscoring its essential role in establishing cutaneous persistence. Als4112 also contributes to systemic infection, highlighting the connection between adherence and pathogenicity in this organism. Finally, coating plastic and catheter surfaces with collagen I or III markedly inhibited C. auris attachment and biofilm formation, offering an approach to curb nosocomial transmission. Our study highlights the critical role of Als4112 in C. auris colonization and virulence in vivo, making it an attractive target for future vaccine development. This study also explores the potential of specific collagen coatings as a novel strategy to prevent C. auris adherence to abiotic surfaces, offering new therapeutic avenues to control the spread of C. auris in healthcare settings."
"Cells must sense and respond to available nutrients to utilize resources and establish fungal colonies. Saprophytic microbes harvest carbon from plant biomass, which contains insoluble, complex carbohydrates that must be degraded extracellularly prior to import into the cell. Filamentous fungi can degrade these complex carbohydrates. However, while many single cellular microbes can utilize the building blocks of these insoluble polysaccharides, they frequently are unable to degrade insoluble carbohydrates. Cellobiose is a disaccharide breakdown product of cellulose, the most abundant component of plant biomass. We investigated the genetic regulation of cellobiose utilization in the oleaginous, basidiomycete yeast Rhodotorula (Rhodosporidium) toruloides using a combination of phylogenetic, genetic, and genomic approaches. We tested the closest R. toruloides homolog of the cellulose degradation regulator CLR-2/ClrB for a role in cellobiose utilization. Deletion of this transcription factor, which we named Cbr1, eliminated the ability of cells to grow on media containing cellobiose as the sole carbon source. Although the role of CLR-2/ClrB is limited to regulating the expression of genes involved in the utilization of cellulose and hemicellulose, Cbr1 plays a role not only in cellobiose utilization, but also utilization of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the genes activated by Cbr1 included genes encoding {beta}-glucosidases and transporters. These {beta}-glucosidases are secreted and are necessary for cellobiose utilization, while one of the transporters is required for utilization of the TCA cycle intermediate, citrate. Additionally, Cbr1 inhibits carbon catabolite repression specifically during utilization of disaccharides, which may have evolved to limit the repression of genes encoding secreted proteins that cleave disaccharides into glucose extracellularly. The co-regulation of cellobiose and TCA cycle utilization with carbon catabolite repression may shed light on alternative methods of the regulation of carbon catabolite repression in fungi."
"Auditory learning is supported by long-term changes in the neural processing of sound. We examined these task-depend changes in auditory cortex by mapping neural sensitivity to timbre, pitch and location cues in trained ferrets (n = 5), and untrained control ferrets (n = 5). Trained animals either identified vowels in a two-alternative forced choice task (n = 3) or discriminated when a repeating vowel changed in identity or pitch (n = 2). Neural responses were recorded under anesthesia in two primary auditory cortical fields and two tonotopically organized non-primary fields. In trained animals, the overall sensitivity to sound timbre was reduced across three cortical fields compared to control animals, but maintained in a non-primary field (the posterior pseudosylvian field). While training did not increase sensitivity to timbre across auditory cortex, it did change the way in which neurons integrated spectral information with neural responses in trained animals increasing their sensitivity to first and second formant frequencies,, whereas in control animals cortical sensitivity to spectral timbre depends mostly on the second formant. Animals trained on timbre identification were required to generalize across pitch when discriminating timbre and their neurons became less modulated by fundamental frequency relative to control animals. Finally, both trained groups showed increased spatial sensitivity and an enhanced response to sound source locations close to the midline, where the loudspeaker was located in the training chamber. These results demonstrate that training elicited widespread alterations in the cortical representation of complex sounds."
"Intrinsically disordered proteins and polypeptides can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form condensates/coacervates, which play numerous regulatory roles in the cell. Recently, the relevance of such LLPS occurring in the vicinity of membranes has been brought to light by several experimental studies. Membrane-adsorbed condensates are crucial for biomolecular localization, and in some cases, phase separation of proteins at the membrane surface induces significant changes in membrane morphology. A detailed microscopic understanding of the mechanisms behind these observations remains incomplete. Here we combine experiments and molecular simulations to unravel structural and dynamic features of the coacervate/membrane interface across scales. We study poly-Lysine/poly-Aspartate (K10/D10) coacervates as a prototype of phase-separated condensates with different unilamellar liposomes. Using a multiscale characterization approach that combines confocal microscopy, hyperspectral imaging, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, and two complementary coarse-grained approaches, we show that the membrane-condensate affinity can be tuned by the anionic lipid content and quantified through the intrinsic contact angle - a material property derived from system geometry - both in vitro and in silico. We find that the membrane region in contact with the condensate displays a nearly two-fold reduced fluidity compared to the bare membrane. This is attributed to orientational ordering of lipid tails, resulting in decreased area per lipid. Moreover, we observed local lipid de-mixing induced by the coacervate adsorption. This study provides an effective framework for integrating experiment and computation to characterize the properties of coacervate/membrane interfaces that are critical to the functional impacts of these interactions."
"SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is mediated by the spike protein, which drives membrane fusion. While cryo-EM has revealed stable prefusion and postfusion conformations of the spike, the transient intermediate states during the fusion process have remained poorly understood. Here, we designed a near-native viral fusion system that recapitulates SARS- CoV-2 entry and used cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to capture fusion intermediates leading to complete fusion. The spike protein undergoes extensive structural rearrangements, progressing through extended, partially folded, and fully folded intermediates prior to fusion-pore formation, a process that is dependent on protease cleavage and inhibited by the WS6 S2 antibody. Upon interaction with ACE2 receptor dimer, spikes cluster at membrane interfaces and following S2 cleavage concurrently transition to postfusion conformations encircling the hemifusion and pre-fusion pores in a distinct conical arrangement. Subtomogram averaging revealed that the WS6 S2 antibody binds to the spikes stem-helix, crosslinks and clusters prefusion spikes and inhibits refolding of fusion intermediates. These findings elucidate the complete process of spike-mediated fusion and SARS-CoV-2 entry, highlighting the neutralizing mechanism of S2-targeting antibodies."
"Phosphorus (P) availability affects soil carbon (C) cycling such as microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) and priming effects (PEs). While non-allophanic Andosols are characterized by high organic C content and strong P retention, the effects of different soil P fertility levels on C dynamics in these soils remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a 20-day incubation experiment using 13C-enriched glucose to investigate how different soil P levels (Truog-P: 157 mg P kg-1 and 12 mg P kg-1) impacted microbial C dynamics in non-allophanic Andosols under different field management practices. Our results showed that soil organic matter (SOM) priming strongly depends on soil P levels, although total primed CO2-C emissions were low in these soils. The addition of glucose alone promoted positive PEs compared to the addition of glucose with nitrogen (N). In high P soils, glucose and N addition resulted in negative PEs, whereas in low P soils, the same treatment stimulated microbial SOM mining, resulting in positive PEs. Additionally, higher CUE was found in high P soils than in low P soils after 20 days of incubation. These findings suggest that soil P levels influence both substrate-induced microbial assimilation and SOM decomposition. In P-limited soils, microbial P requirements drive SOM decomposition, which in turn regulates CUE. This study contributes to an understanding of the role of P in soil C cycling and provides insights into soil fertility management strategies for improving C sequestration in non-allophanic Andosols."
"In temporal interference (TI) electrical brain stimulation (EBS), an emerging neuromodulation technique, the interference of two high-frequency currents with a small frequency difference is used to target specific brain regions with better focality than in standard EBS. While the magnitude of the modulation depth has been previously investigated, an explicit formula for the directions in which this modulation is maximized has been lacking. This work provides a novel closed-form analytical expression for the orientation of maximum modulation depth in TI EBS. We also found a secondary orientation where the modulation depth has a local maximum and provide closed-form analytical formulas for this orientation as well as for the modulation depth along this orientation. To our knowledge, this is the first published closed-form expressions for these specific orientations in the context of TI stimulation. We mathematically derive these compact formulas and validate them through comprehensive computational simulations using a realistic human head model. Our simulations demonstrate that the modulation depth predicted with our new analytic direction formula of maximum modulation depth is indeed the maximum compared to other directions. The derived closed-form expression offers a faster and more precise alternative to numerical iterative optimization methods used in previous studies to estimate this direction. We also provide a complete analytical derivation of the widely used (Grossman et al., 2017) formula for the maximum modulation depth magnitude. Furthermore, we found that due to interference in 3D, the modulation depth along the secondary maximum orientation can be of similar strength than the maximum modulation depth intensity when interfering electric field vectors are significantly misaligned. Finally, we show that by modifying the ratio of the injected current strengths, it is possible to steer these directions to fine tune the stimulation along a desired direction of interest. Overall, this work represents a detailed treatment of TI electrical fields in 3D. The presented closed-form expressions for the directions of maximum and secondary maximum modulation depths are relevant for the better interpretation of both simulated and experimental results in TI studies by allowing comparison with neuronal orientations in the brain."
"Eukaryotic cells primarily generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation and substrate-level phosphorylation. Despite the superior efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, eukaryotic cells often utilize both pathways as aerobic glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen. However, its role in cell survival remains poorly understood. In this study, aerobic glycolysis of the Warburg effect in breast cancer cells (MCF7) and the Crabtree effect in a laboratory strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S288C) were compared following treatment with electron transport chain inhibitors, including FCCP, antimycin A, and oligomycin. MCF7 and S288C exhibited strikingly similar metabolic rewiring toward substrate-level phosphorylation against the inhibitor treatment, suggesting that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and cytosolic substrate-level phosphorylation communicate through a common mechanism. Measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP concentration further indicated that cytosolic ATP was transported into the mitochondria under conditions of reduced electron transport chain activity. This ATP was likely utilized by the reverse mode of H+/ATPase to maintain the MMP which contributed to avoiding programmed cell death. These results suggest that the ATP supply to mitochondria plays a conserved role in aerobic glycolysis across yeast and mammalian cancer cells. This mechanism likely contributes to cell survival under conditions of fluctuating oxygen availability."
"Cognitive flexibility in the human brain engages dynamic interactions between the Default Mode Network (DMN) and the Fronto-Parietal Network (FPN), a functional architecture that is metabolically demanding and thus potentially susceptible to age-related decline. How the aging brain reorganizes its functional architecture to sustain cognitive flexibility under metabolic constraints remains an open question. In this study, we modeled resting-state functional flexibility across the adult lifespan (ages 18-88) using structural balance theory. Our findings align with the predictions of the SENECA model (Synergistic, Economical, Nonlinear, Emergent, Cognitive Aging), revealing a midlife neurocognitive transition: (i) from a metabolically costly, flexible DMN-FPN architecture, toward (ii) a more redundant configuration dominated by low-cost, sensory-driven interactions. The medio-parietal DMN and the Cingulo-Opercular Network (CON) are crucial to this transition, contributing to maintain global brain activity near a critical dynamic regime in older adulthood that optimizes for cognitive flexibility in face of declining metabolic resources. These findings advance a theoretical and methodological framework for understanding neurocognitive flexibility in aging and underscore the importance of multimodal fMRI-PET studies in midlife. They also open promising avenues for translational applications in neuropathology.

"Experimental data-driven research relies on raw data, which consist of unprocessed experimental outputs, whereas derived data are transformed through a number of processing steps to reveal specific insights. Such processing, however, can potentially introduce biases or information loss, compromising transparency and reproducibility. In nucleic acid sequencing, nucleotide sequences stored in the FASTQ format are widely shared, but FASTQ files are generated from platform-specific raw data outputs, which vary depending on the sequencing platform used. The raw data produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing devices contain valuable biological information and are also useful to improve data processing methods, which includes basecaller optimisation and modification detection. Increasing attention goes to exploring these raw signals to develop algorithms that could improve ONT device portability and enhance target enrichment efficiency through adaptive sampling. Despite these benefits, the storage and sharing of raw nanopore data remain limited due to technical constraints and the lack of appropriate, standardised and centralised infrastructure. To address this challenge, we developed SquiDBase (https://squidbase.org), a dedicated repository to collect raw microbial nanopore sequencing data. To maximise the utility of SquiDBase from its inception, we built SquiDPipe, a Nextflow pipeline for the automated removal of human or unwanted reads from raw nanopore data. Additionally, we sequenced 24 clinically relevant viruses and incorporated them into SquiDBase, significantly expanding the diversity of publicly available reference datasets. By offering a centralised, open-access raw data collection platform, SquiDBase facilitates data sharing, enhances reproducibility, and supports the development and benchmarking of novel computational tools, reinforcing open science in nanopore sequencing research."
"Multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy provides detailed insights into the spatial architecture of cancer tissue. Classical analysis approaches focus on single-cell data but can be limited by segmentation accuracy and the representational power of extracted features, potentially overlooking crucial spatial interrelationships among cells. We developed a hierarchical self-supervised deep learning approach that learns feature representations from multiplexed microscopy images without expert annotations. The method encodes tissue samples at both the local (cellular) level and the global (tissue architecture) level. We applied our method to lung, prostate, and renal cancer tissue microarray cohorts to investigate whether self-supervised learning can recognize clinically meaningful protein marker patterns from multiplexed microscopy images. We observed that the learned features identified prognostically distinct patient groups, which show significant differences in survival outcomes. These patient groups matched earlier findings obtained with classical single-cell analysis using expert annotations. Moreover, attention maps extracted from these models highlighted crucial tissue regions that correlate with specific marker combinations. Overall, the approach effectively profiles complex multiplexed microscopy images, offering potential for improved biomarker discovery and more informed cancer treatment decisions."
"Automated protein function annotation is a fundamental problem in computational biology, crucial for understanding the functional roles of proteins in biological processes, with broad implications in medicine and biotechnology. A persistent challenge in this problem is the imbalanced, long-tail distribution of available function annotations: a small set of well-studied function classes account for most annotated proteins, while many other classes have few annotated proteins, often due to investigative bias, experimental limitations, or intrinsic biases in protein evolution. As a result, existing machine learning models for protein function prediction tend to only optimize the prediction accuracy for well-studied function classes overrepresented in the training data, leading to poor accuracy for understudied functions. In this work, we develop MSRep, a novel deep learning-based protein function annotation framework designed to address this imbalance issue and improve annotation accuracy. MSRep is inspired by an intriguing phenomenon, called neural collapse (NC), commonly observed in high-accuracy deep neural networks used for classification tasks, where hidden representations in the final layer collapse to class-specific mean embeddings, while maintaining maximal inter-class separation. Given that NC consistently emerges across diverse architectures and tasks for high-accuracy models, we hypothesize that inducing NC structure in models trained on imbalanced data can enhance both prediction accuracy and generalizability. To achieve this, MSRep refines a pre-trained protein language model to produce NC-like representations by optimizing an NC-inspired loss function, which ensures that minority functions are equally represented in the embedding space as majority functions, in contrast to conventional classification methods whose embedding spaces are dominated by overrepresented classes. In evaluations across four protein function annotation tasks on the prediction of Enzyme Commission numbers, Gene3D codes, Pfam families, and Gene Ontology terms, MSRep demonstrates superior predictive performance for both well- and underrepresented classes, outperforming several state-of-the-art annotation tools. We anticipate that MSRep will enhance the annotation of understudied functions and novel, uncharacterized proteins, advancing future protein function studies and accelerating the discovery of new functional proteins. The source code of MSRep is available at https://github.com/luo-group/MSRep."
"BackgroundThe avian caecal microbiota plays a vital role in host nutrition, enabling non-digestible, fibrous material to be converted into compounds that can be absorbed and used as an energy source by the host. The diet of adult red grouse (Lagopus scotica) is dominated by heather (Calluna vulgaris), which is particularly high in fibre. It is therefore likely that the caecal microbiota plays a key role in enabling grouse to thrive on this diet. In this study, we present the first characterisation of the caecal microbiota of red grouse using modern sequencing methods.

ResultsWe performed metagenomic sequencing on caecal content samples from fifteen red grouse from three upland estates in Scotland. From this data, we constructed and characterised twelve high-quality, species-level metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). Eleven of these MAGs could not be assigned a taxonomic label at species level, indicating that they may be novel species. MAGs belonged to diverse taxa (5 phyla) and several encoded genes and pathways for the digestion of fibres, including cellulose, hemi-cellulose, xylooligosaccharides and pectin. Several MAGs also contained antimicrobial resistance genes, predominantly related to vancomycin resistance.

ConclusionsThis study is the first to reconstruct commensal microbial genomes from red grouse. The caeca contain diverse, often novel, microbial taxa capable of fermenting various fibres, potentially aiding in the digestion of the red grouses high-fibre diet. Further research is necessary to explore how these bacteria support red grouse nutrition and health."
"Trichuriasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects as many as 500 million individuals and can cause significant morbidity. For decades, it was thought to be caused by one species of whipworm, Trichuris trichiura. Significant differences in response rates to the best available anthelmintic treatment -- a combination of albendazole and ivermectin -- for trichuriasis exist across clinical trial reports yet the underlying reasons are unclear. Here, we present and characterize a human-infecting Trichuris species that we named Trichuris incognita. Combining long- and short-read sequencing approaches, we assembled a high-quality reference genome of T. incognita to construct the species tree of the Trichuris genus using 12434 orthologous groups. We sequenced a total of 747 individual worms which were used to confirm the phylogenetic placement. Comparative genomic analysis of genes implied in the resistance of either albendazole or ivermectin in helminths revealed a high copy number of the beta-tubulin (TUBB) gene, present in the whole population of T. incognita, compared to the canonical T. trichiura species. We conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) comparing 160 albendazole-ivermectin sensitive to 492 drug non-sensitive worms, which did not point towards an adaptation to drug pressure within the same species. Our results demonstrate that trichuriasis can be caused by multiple species of whipworm. This discovery, coupled with high tolerability of T. incognita to albendazole-ivermectin marks a significant shift in how we understand and approach whipworm infections."
"Diverse phage-bacteria communities coexist at high densities in environmental, agricultural, and human-associated micro-biomes. Phage-bacteria coexistence is often attributed to coevolutionary processes mediated by complex, pairwise infection networks. Here, using in vitro experiments and mathematical models, we explore how higher-order interactions function as a complementary, ecological feedback mechanism to stabilize phage-bacteria communities. To do so, we examine an environmentally-derived, synthetic phage-bacteria community comprised of five marine heterotrophic bacteria (Cellulophaga baltica and Pseudoalteromonas strains) and five associated phage. We used Bayesian inference to reconstruct free phage production in one-step growth experiments and then forecasted pairwise phage-bacteria dynamics over multiple infection cycles. In contrast to model predictions of rapid bacterial population collapse, each bacterial strain persisted, consistent with density-dependent stabilization mechanisms at high virus densities. We then extended models into a community context and found an additional stabilization mechanism: life history traits differ in community vs. pairwise contexts. Follow-up experiments confirm that lysis is inhibited at relatively high viral densities and phage traits (including burst size) can shift when infecting single vs. multiple strains. More broadly, these findings suggest that complex community coexistence of phage and bacteria may be more common than anticipated when including feedback mechanisms outside of regimes of fitted pairwise models that do not reflect the full scope of ecologically relevant contexts."
"BackgroundColon cancer progression heavily relies on intricate mechanisms of invasion, metastasis, and migration. Tight junction protein Cldn2 has emerged as a potential regulator of these processes. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms linking Clan2 deletion to gene expression changes related to motility, invasion, and metastasis in colon caner.

MethodsCRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of human Cldn2 in HCT116 cells was conducted, and the resulting cells were compared to the wild-type cells using real-time PCR to analyze the expression of genes associated with invasion and metastasis.

ResultsCldn2-KO resulted in a widespread downregulation of genes linked to motility, invasion, and metastasis, including ZONAB, NDRG1, Cldn14, Cldn23, Bcl2, , P53, and BCL-6. These findings suggest a potential regulatory role of Cldn2 in the expression of these genes, influencing colon cancer cell migration and spread.

ConclusionThis study identified Claudin-2 as a crucial regulator of genes involved in colorectal cancer metastasis. Downregulation of these genes upon Claudin-2 deletion suggests its inhibitory role in cancer cell motility and invasion. Further investigation into the specific downstream signaling pathways mediated by Claudin-2 could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting metastasis inhibition."
"Perceptual decision-making enables humans to process sensory information and translate it into goal-directed actions. A critical component of this process is response time, which declines with age due to the slowing of both non-decision processes and evidence accumulation. While perceptual learning has been shown to counteract these declines, it remains unclear whether non-decision processes can be accelerated through direct neural stimulation, bypassing the need for long training sessions. Here, we propose that Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) can enhance perceptual decision-making by specifically reducing non-decision time. To test this hypothesis, we tracked response times during a perceptual learning task while recording brain activity. Using the Drift Diffusion Model, we quantified the effects of TMS on mental speed and non-decision time. Our findings reveal that perceptual learning decreases response time by simultaneously increasing mental speed and reducing non-decision time. Crucially, TMS application to brain regions associated with perceptual learning further shortened non-decision time without altering mental speed. These results demonstrate that TMS can selectively accelerate non-decision processes, offering a promising intervention for mitigating age-related cognitive slowing and enhancing decision efficiency.

Significance StatementPerceptual decision-making is a fundamental cognitive process that slows with age due to declines in both non-decision processes and mental speed. While perceptual learning can mitigate these declines through practice, we propose that non-decision time can also be reduced by directly stimulating neural ensembles using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Our study demonstrates that TMS applied to task-relevant brain areas decreases non-decision time, thereby accelerating response speed without affecting mental speed. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for enhancing perceptual decision-making efficiency and highlight TMS as a potential tool for counteracting age-related cognitive slowing."
"Macrophages are a pivotal cell type within the synovial lining and sub-lining of the joint, playing a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis of synovium. Although fate-mapping techniques have been employed to differentiate synovial macrophages from other synovial myeloid cells, no comprehensive study has yet been conducted within the mouse synovial macrophage compartment. In this study, we present, for the first time, lineage tracing results from 18 myeloid-specific fate-mapping models in mouse peripheral blood (PB) and synovial tissue. The identification of synovial macrophages and monocyte-lineage cells through flow cytometry was further validated using cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) datasets. These findings provide a valuable methodological tool for researchers to select appropriate models for studying the function of synovial myeloid cells and serve as a reference for investigations in other tissue types."
"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have provided insight into the neurotransmission underlying motor inhibition but are limited to the primary motor cortex (M1). To investigate {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamatergic neurotransmission across the broader motor inhibition network, we combined TMS with electroencephalography (EEG). The N45 and N100 components of the TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) have been liked to GABAa and GABAb signaling, respectively, whereas the N15, P30 and P60 TEPs are believed to reflect glutamatergic neurotransmission. This study investigates how these components are modulated during reactive and proactive motor inhibition. Twenty-four healthy participants completed two TMS-EEG sessions targeting either the left M1 or the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) at rest and during a stop-signal task. We compared TEP amplitudes across TMS conditions (active/sham) and trial types and assessed their relationship with task performance. Participants with a higher N45 amplitude over M1 at rest demonstrated a faster stop-signal reaction time. Active TMS during successful motor inhibition evoked higher N15 amplitudes over preSMA than during uncertain go trials, suggesting that an early excitatory signal from preSMA is crucial for reactive inhibition. In contrast, proactive inhibition was linked to lower P30 amplitudes in M1, possibly reflecting reduced motor facilitation. These findings provide novel empirical insights into the neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning motor inhibition, emphasizing the importance of a coordinated balance between inhibitory processes in M1 and early glutamatergic excitatory signals from preSMA for effective inhibition."
"Triazolinedione (TAD) derivatives have been commonly utilized as protection and labeling reagents for indole and phenol moieties via a reversible ene-type reaction. Previous studies showed that the TAD probes could selectively modify tyrosine and tryptophan side-chains within proteins and peptides under distinct pH conditions. Here, we report a pH-controlled regioselective rapid ene-type reaction (RRER) between TAD and 5-hydroxyindole, where the modification occurs on the C4 position rather than the C3 of inactivated indole rings. Employing this unique reaction, we have performed the selective bioconjugation of serotonylation occurring on the fifth amino acid residue, glutamine, of histone H3 (H3Q5), which does not contain any tryptophan in its protein sequence. Finally, RRER was applied to determine the H3Q5 serotonylation levels in cultured cells and tissue samples, which served as a newly developed powerful tool for in vitro and in vivo histone monoaminylation analysis. Overall, our findings in this research expanded the chemical biology toolbox for investigating histone monoaminylation and facilitated the understandings of TAD-mediated ene-type reactions."
"The carbohydrate 3D structure-prediction tools (builders) at GLYCAM-Web (glycam.org) are widely used for generating experimentally-consistent 3D structures of oligosaccharides suitable for data interpretation, hypothesis generation, simple visualization, and subsequent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The graphical user interface (GUI) enables users to create carbohydrate sequences (e.g. DGalpb1-4DGlcpb1-OH) that are converted to 3D models of the carbohydrate structures in multiple formats, including PDB and OFF (AMBER software format). The resulting structures are energy minimized prior to download and online visualization. There are advanced options for selecting which shapes (rotamers) of the oligosaccharide to generate, and for creating explicitly solvated structures for subsequent MD simulation. The GLYCAM-Web builders integrate known conformational preferences of oligosaccharides, summarized here, and employ the GLYCAM forcefield for energy minimization with algorithms tailored for speed and scalability. Even for large oligosaccharides (100 residues, ~2100 atoms) a 3D structure is typically returned to the user in less than a minute."
"The mechanisms of reversible inhibitors with a single binding site on enzymes are usually divided into basic groups: linear and hyperbolic, also called partial. Each of them subdivided into types: competitive, non-competitive and mixed. These six mechanisms are often considered separate identities. Here, prompted by the characterization of the inhibition of the wild-type and mutant {beta}-glucosidase Sf{beta}gly by Imidazole and Tris (2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol) we developed a unifying enzyme kinetic model that integrates these six basic inhibition mechanism onto a single one. From this model we deduced a general enzyme kinetic equation that through modulation of simple parameters, i.e. the relative inhibitor affinity for two binding sites and the reactivity of the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex, is converted into the particular kinetic equation of each of those six inhibition mechanism. In short, we conclude that six fundamental inhibition mechanisms, linear and hyperbolic, are not isolate compartments, but actually facets of the same general model here presented."
"In animals, collective cell migration is critical during development and adult life for repairing organs. It remains, however, poorly understood compared with single cell migration. Polymerization of branched actin by the RAC1-WAVE-Arp2/3 pathway is well established to power membrane protrusions at the front of migrating cells, but also to maintain cell junctions in epithelial monolayers. Here we performed a screen for novel regulators of collective cell migration by identifying genes associated with the RAC1-WAVE-Arp2/3 pathway at cell junctions using dependency maps and by inactivating these candidates using CRISPR/Cas9. In wound healing, MCF10A epithelial cells collectively migrate towards the free space in a coordinated manner. PKN2 knockout (KO) cells display decreased collective migration due to destabilization of adherens junctions, whereas MOB4 KO cells display increased collective migration with a swirling behavior. Upon wound healing, PKN2 relocalizes to lateral junctions and maintains coordinated migration in the monolayer, whereas MOB4 relocalizes to the front edge of cells migrating towards the wound. The role of MOB4 in controlling collective migration requires YAP1, since MOB4 KO cells fail to activate YAP1 and their phenotype is rescued by constitutively active YAP1. Together, our data reveal two complementary activities required for coordinating cells in collective migration."
"Cells are a fundamental unit of biological organization, and identifying them in imaging data - cell segmentation - is a critical task for various cellular imaging experiments. While deep learning methods have led to substantial progress on this problem, most models are specialist models that work well for specific domains but cannot be applied across domains or scale well with large amounts of data. In this work, we present CellSAM, a universal model for cell segmentation that generalizes across diverse cellular imaging data. CellSAM builds on top of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by developing a prompt engineering approach for mask generation. We train an object detector, CellFinder, to automatically detect cells and prompt SAM to generate segmentations. We show that this approach allows a single model to achieve human-level performance for segmenting images of mammalian cells, yeast, and bacteria collected across various imaging modalities. We show that CellSAM has strong zero-shot performance and can be improved with a few examples via few-shot learning. Additionally, we demonstrate how CellSAM can be applied across diverse bioimage analysis workflows. A deployed version of CellSAM is available at https://cellsam.deepcell.org/."
"Chronic inflammation in autoimmunity is driven by T cell hyperactivation. This unregulated response to self is fuelled by heightened metabolic programmes, which offers a promising new direction to uncover novel treatment strategies. /{beta}-hydrolase domain-containing protein 11 (ABHD11) is a mitochondrial hydrolase that maintains the catalytic function of -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (-KGDH), and its expression in CD4+ T cells has been linked to remission status in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the importance of ABHD11 in regulating T cell metabolism and function - and thus, the downstream implication for autoimmunity - is yet to be explored. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of ABHD11 dampens cytokine production by human and mouse T cells. Mechanistically, the anti-inflammatory effects of ABHD11 inhibition are attributed to increased 24,25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC) biosynthesis and subsequent liver X receptor (LXR) activation, which arise from a compromised TCA cycle. The impaired cytokine profile established by ABHD11 inhibition is extended to two patient cohorts of autoimmunity. Importantly, using a murine model of accelerated type 1 diabetes (T1D), we show that targeting ABHD11 suppresses cytokine production in antigen-specific T cells and delays the onset of diabetes in vivo. Collectively, our work provides pre-clinical evidence that ABHD11 is an encouraging drug target in T cell-mediated autoimmunity.

"Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) and spatially resolved proteomics (SRP) data enable the study of gene expression and protein abundances within their precise spatial and cellular contexts in tissues. Certain SRT and SRP tech-nologies also capture corresponding morphology images, adding another layer of valuable information. However, few existing methods developed for SRT data effectively leverage these supplementary images to enhance clustering performance. Here, we introduce stDyer-image, an end-to-end deep learning framework designed for clustering for SRT and SRP datasets with images. Unlike existing methods that utilize images to complement gene expression data, stDyer-image directly links image features to cluster labels. This approach draws inspiration from pathologists, who can visually identify specific cell types or tumor regions from morphological images without relying on gene expression or protein abundances. Benchmarks against state-of-the-art tools demonstrate that stDyer-image achieves superior performance in clustering. Moreover, it is capable of handling large-scale datasets across diverse technologies, making it a versatile and powerful tool for spatial omics analysis."
"The evolution of vision is a major novelty in animals, playing a fundamental role in developing complex behaviours. Vision initiates with a light-triggered phototransduction cascade occurring in photoreceptor cells (PRCs). The two main PRC types, ciliary and rhabdomeric, employ both specific and common genes for phototransduction. Despite being crucial for vision, the origin and evolution of photoreceptor cells and phototransduction pathways remain unclear.

Using phylogenetic methods, we studied the evolution of all phototransduction genes, elucidating their gene duplication patterns in over 80 species, including non-bilaterian metazoans and other eukaryotes. Then, we investigated the expression of phototransduction genes in available single-cell RNA-sequencing data from various animals, including non-bilaterians. By using phototransduction genes as markers, we identified putative photoreceptor-like cells across animals and compared their regulatory toolkits.

Gene families encoding phototransduction components are generally ancient, predating the origin of vision. However, many phototransduction genes originated in the metazoan stem group. Moreover, putative photoreceptor cells identified in non-bilaterians appeared to express some but not all components of the two well-characterised phototransduction pathways, suggesting potential lineage-specific components involved in phototransduction. Finally, we identified conserved expression of certain transcription factors in putative PRCs in non-bilaterians, suggesting the homology of PRCs."
"Chronic sleep insufficiency is prevalent in modern society and has been associated with age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Loss of sleep accelerates the progression of neurodegeneration in animal models of neurological diseases. Here, we study whether chronic sleep curtailment leads to brain aging in wild-type animals without a genetic predisposition. We used a wild-type mouse model to simulate modern-day conditions of restricted sleep and compared the brain (cortex) proteome of young sleep-restricted animals with different aged control groups. We report the alteration of 149 proteins related to sleep and 1269 related to age with 96 proteins common between them. Through pathway analysis of proteins common to sleep restriction and aging, we discovered that the complement and coagulation cascade pathways were enriched by alterations of complement component 3 (C3), alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), fibrinogen alfa and beta chain (FGA and FGB). This is the first study indicating the possible role of the complement and coagulation pathways in brain aging and by chronic sleep restriction (CSR) in mice."
"The potential for bioremediation of dichloroanilines (2,3- and 3,4-DCA) and dichloronitrobenzenes (3,4-, 2,5- and 2,3-DCNB) was investigated using inocula from an industrial site in northeast of Brazil. Anaerobic biotransformation of these chlorinated compounds was observed in microcosms simulating site conditions, particularly when electron donor was added. To disentangle specific transformation reactions, sub-cultures from active anaerobic microcosms were enriched with individual DCA or DCNB isomers. In these single-compound enrichment cultures, DCNB isomers were reduced to the corresponding DCA. Each DCA isomer was stoichiometrically dechlorinated to the corresponding monochloroaniline (CA) isomers. Further dechlorination of CA to aniline was noted. The reduction of DCNB to DCA was sustained by known fermenters and possibly Desulfitobacterium, while Dehalobacter was clearly responsible for dechlorination of DCAs. These findings helped to attribute function to microbial community data retrieved from field samples to inform the conceptual site model and enable identification of bioactive zones and rate-limiting conditions at a complex site. More generally, these data broaden the understanding of the metabolic repertoire of Dehalobacter and provide a model for incorporating microbial community data into site remediation efforts.

"Defective mitochondrial quality control in response to loss of mitochondrial membrane polarization is implicated in Parkinsons disease by mutations in PINK1 and PRKN. Application of in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) made it possible to visualize the consequences of mitochondrial depolarization at higher resolution than heretofore attainable. Parkin-expressing U2OS cells were treated with the depolarizing agents oligomycin and antimycin A (OA), subjected to cryo-FIB milling, and mitochondrial structure was characterized by in situ cryo-ET. Phagophores were visualized in association with mitochondrial fragments. Bridge-like lipid transporter (BLTP) densities potentially corresponding to ATG2A were seen connected to mitophagic phagophores. Mitochondria in OA-treated cells were fragmented and devoid of matrix calcium phosphate crystals. The intermembrane gap of cristae was narrowed and the intermembrane volume reduced, and some fragments were devoid of cristae. A subpopulation of ATP synthases re-localized from cristae to the inner boundary membrane (IBM) apposed to the outer membrane (OMM). The structure of the dome-shaped prohibitin complex, a dodecamer of PHB1-PHB2 dimers, was determined in situ by sub-tomogram averaging in untreated and treated cells and found to exist in open and closed conformations, with the closed conformation is enriched by OA treatment. These findings provide a set of native snapshots of the manifold nano-structural consequences of mitochondrial depolarization and provide a baseline for future in situ dissection of Parkin-dependent mitophagy."
"Increasing droughts threaten soil microbial communities and the multiple functions they control in agricultural soils. These soils are often fertilized with mineral nutrients, but it remains unclear how this fertilization may alter the capacity of soil multifunctionality (SMF) to be maintained under drought, and how plant-soil interactions shape these effects. In this study, we used a mountain grassland soil to test the interactive effect of mineral nutrient (Nitrogen and Phosphorous) addition and drought on SMF with and without plants (Lolium perenne) in a mesocosm experiment. We calculated SMF based on 8 microbial properties associated with the capacity of soil microbes to store carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in their biomass, and to process these elements through organic matter depolymerization, mineralization, nitrification and denitrification processes. To investigate mechanisms underlying the SMF response we characterized the associated changes in soil stoichiometry and microbial community composition using 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Our results showed that fertilization decreased the SMF drought resistance when plants were present, but the opposite was observed in the unplanted mountain grassland soil. Our analysis suggested this was due to the interaction of plants, fertilization and drought in influencing four coupled properties related to high SMF: high soil moisture, low microbial C limitation, high bacterial diversity and low bacteria gram positive:gram negative ratio. Altogether, our results suggested that reducing the use of mineral fertilizer for plant production in mountain grassland could improve the ability of their soils to maintain their multifunctionality during drought period. Finally, our study clearly further demonstrated the importance of plant in the complex responses of SMF to global changes and showed that combining stoichiometric and microbial diversity assessment represents a powerful approach to disentangle the underlying mechanisms."
"Argonaute proteins provide innate immunity in all domains of life through guide-dependent recognition of invader nucleic acids. While eukaryotic Argonautes (eAgos) act on RNA during RNA interference, prokaryotic Argonautes (pAgos) mainly recognize DNA targets. Many eAgos and some pAgos are active nucleases that directly cleave their targets. In contrast, short pAgos lack the nuclease activity and are co-encoded with additional effectors. Diverse effector domains in short pAgo systems include NADases and tentative nucleases, but their mechanisms of activation remain largely unknown. Here, we characterize SPARHA systems (short prokaryotic argonautes, HNH-associated) encoding HNH nuclease effectors. We show that short pAgo activates the HNH effector after RNA-guided DNA recognition. Target recognition induces formation of filaments of SPARHA with double active sites formed at the interfaces of repetitive HNH domains, which results in indiscriminate collateral degradation of DNA and protects bacterial population from invaders. The results show that pAgos and associated effectors act as modular two-component systems that translate recognition of specific DNA into immune response through assembly of supramolecular complexes, deleterious for invaders and potentially useful for biotechnology."
"Prolonged exposure to Gi/o receptor agonists such as opioids can lead to a sensitization of adenylyl cyclases (ACs), resulting in heterologous sensitization or cyclic AMP (cAMP) overshoot. The molecular consequences of cAMP overshoot are not well understood, but this adaptive response is suggested to play a critical role in the development of opioid tolerance and withdrawal. We found that genetic reduction of AC1 and simultaneous upregulation of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel subunits, SUR1 or Kir6.2, significantly attenuated morphine tolerance and reduced naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. In vitro models utilized an EPAC2-GFP-cAMP biosensor to investigate sensitization of adenylyl cyclase in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and HEK{Delta}AC3/6 knockout cells. Acute application of DAMGO significantly decreased the cAMP signal from the EPAC2-GFP-cAMP biosensor, while chronic DAMGO administration resulted in enhanced cAMP production following AC stimulation. Inhibition of cAMP overshoot was observed with naloxone (NAL), pertussis toxin (PTX), and the neddylation inhibitor, MLN4924 (Pevonedistat), as well as co-expression of {beta}-adrenergic receptor kinase C-terminus ({beta}ARK-CT). After establishment of the AC1-EPAC sensitization in the in vitro models, we found that inhibition of AC1 or EPAC enhanced potassium channel activity after chronic morphine treatment, using a thallium-based assay in SH-SY5Y cells. Similar data were obtained in mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) after chronic morphine treatment. This study presents evidence for investigating further AC1 signaling as a target for opioid tolerance and withdrawal, by increasing EPAC activity and affecting potassium channels downstream of opioid receptors.

"(Macro-)Autophagy is a key cellular stress response mediating the recycling of long-lived or damaged proteins and organelles. In stem cells, autophagy is essential for the decision between quiescence, self-renewal and differentiation. We observed that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and thereof derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) have a functional autophagy machinery, as shown by starvation-induced autophagic flux and ULK1 activation. Using the human iPSC line iPS11 and thereof derived NPCs (niPS11), we investigated whether genotoxic stress induced by benzo[a]pyrene diolepoxide (BPDE) or etoposide can similarly activate autophagy, as previously reported for cancer cell lines. While both BPDE and etoposide induced the DNA damage markers phospho-p53 Ser15 and {gamma}H2AX and slightly altered the expression of DNA repair proteins such as XPC, they did not trigger autophagic flux in either iPSCs or NPCs. After genotoxin treatment, ULK1 activation was only observed in NPCs, but this was not sufficient to trigger a significant downstream autophagic response. Mass spectrometry revealed minimal proteomic changes in iPSCs and moderate changes in NPCs, mainly involving mitotic regulators. These results suggest that genotoxic agents do not strongly affect canonical autophagy in pluripotent stem cells or their neural derivatives despite an otherwise responsive autophagic system."
"ObjectivesExamination of bronchial epithelium-derived gene expression signature of bronchiectasis (BE) in nasal epithelium.

MethodsWe studied 220 participants from the Detection of Early Lung Cancer Among Military Personnel study with bulk RNA-seq of nasal epithelium brushings. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to examine whether genes previously identified as increased or decreased in the bronchial epithelium of individuals with radiologic BE are significantly enriched among the genes most significantly altered in the nasal epithelium. GSEA and cell-type specific gene expression signatures were used to examine changes in the cellular composition of nasal epithelium associated with radiologic BE.

ResultsGenes previously found to have significantly altered expression in bronchial epithelium in radiologic BE are concordantly enriched among the genes most increased or decreased in nasal epithelium in radiologic BE in this validation set (p = 3x10-7, increased; p = 6x10-8, decreased). GSEA performed using cell-type signatures demonstrates that in nasal epithelium, BE is associated with increased multiciliated and deuterosomal cell-related gene expression and decreased expression of basal cell- related gene expression, consistent with our previous findings in bronchial epithelium.

ConclusionOur work validates our bronchial signature of BE in an independent dataset and demonstrates that similar gene expression changes are associated with radiologic BE in the bronchial and nasal epithelium. These findings support considering nasal epithelium brushing as a less invasive tool for screening and monitoring BE.

SummaryThis study validates a previously reported bronchial signature of bronchiectasis (BE) in nasal epithelium. Changes in gene expression and cell-type composition associated with radiologic BE are similar across both bronchial and nasal epithelium."
"Neural stability is essential for executing learned motor behaviors while plasticity provides the flexibility needed to adapt to new tasks and environments. Although low-dimensional neural population dynamics exhibit long-term stability, the extent to which individual neurons retain their functional properties over time and balance the need for both stability and plasticity remains an open question. Tracking individual neurons across multiple recording sessions is crucial to addressing this question, yet conventional methods face challenges such as electrode drift, waveform variability, and large inter-electrode distances that limit the number of channels a neuron is observed on. Here, we introduce a waveform-based neuron tracking method optimized for standard microelectrode arrays, enabling the identification of the same neurons across sessions without relying on spatial overlap, a strategy commonly leveraged with high-density electrode arrays. We apply this method to assess the longitudinal stability of multiple neural properties, including firing rates, inter-spike intervals, tuning properties, and spike-field interactions. Our findings reveal that while spike waveform properties remain stable, certain functional properties such as ISI and tuning can exhibit gradual shifts, suggesting a balance between neural stability and plasticity. Understanding the persistence of individual neural signals provides insight into learning and adaptation while advancing the study of neural stability and plasticity over extended timescales. Beyond basic neuroscience, this framework has potential to enhance the long-term reliability of brain-machine interfaces and closed-loop deep brain stimulation systems that rely on chronic neural sensing."
"Heterotrophic microorganisms in lakewater secrete proteases which contribute to the turnover of dissolved organic matter and the degradation of peptidic contaminants. However, little is known about the identities and substrate specificities of these proteases. Herein, we sought to characterize the global proteolytic fingerprint of the extracellular proteases present in Lake Geneva, the largest freshwater body in Central Europe. Using Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS), we identified preferred enzymatic cleavage next to positively charged and certain non-polar amino acids, while cleavage next to negatively charged residues was disfavored. Specifically, many of the detected cleavage sites were predominantly surrounded by arginine and lysine, consistent with a trypsin-like substrate specificity. This pattern was conserved across seasons and water depths and were shared with two other Swiss lakes. In contrast, we observed variability in the number and types of cleavage sites across samples, suggesting spatial and temporal differences in overall protease diversity. Using class-specific inhibitors, we found that serine and metalloproteases contribute to both exo- and endo-proteolytic activity in lakewater. Our findings expand our understanding of protein stability in lake ecosystems and may be used to predict the fate of peptidic contaminants in the environment."
"Bedaquiline is the cornerstone of a new regimen for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. However, its clinical use is threatened by the emergence of bedaquiline-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Bedaquiline targets mycobacterial ATP synthase but the predominant route to clinical bedaquiline resistance is via upregulation of the MmpS5L5 efflux pump due to mutations that inactivate the transcriptional repressor Rv0678. Here, we show that the MmpS5L5 efflux pump reduces susceptibility to bedaquiline as well as its new, more potent derivative TBAJ-876 and other antimicrobial substrates, including clofazimine and the DprE1 inhibitors PBTZ-169 and OPC-167832. Furthermore, the increased resistance of Rv0678 mutants stems entirely from increased MmpS5L5 activity. These results highlight the potential of a pharmacological MmpS5L5 inhibitor to increase drug efficacy. Verapamil, primarily used as a calcium channel inhibitor, is known to inhibit diverse efflux pumps and to potentiate bedaquiline and clofazimine activity in M. tuberculosis. Here, we show that verapamil potentiates the activity of multiple diverse MmpS5L5 substrates. Using biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that verapamil does not exert this effect by acting as a disruptor of the protonmotive force used to power MmpS5L5, as previously proposed, suggesting that verapamil inhibits the function of the MmpS5L5 pump. Finally, norverapamil, the major verapamil metabolite, which has greatly reduced calcium channel activity, has equal potency in reducing resistance to MmpS5L5 substrates. Our findings highlight verapamils potential for enhancing bedaquiline TB treatment, for preventing acquired resistance to bedaquiline and other MmpS5L5 substrates, while also providing the impetus to identify additional MmpS5L5 inhibitors.

Significance StatementBedaquiline, an antitubercular drug targeting ATP synthase, forms the backbone of highly efficacious treatment regimens for drug-resistant tuberculosis. Bedaquiline resistance is emerging as a significant problem and is most commonly caused by mutations in Rv0678 that result in upregulation of the MmpS5L5 efflux pump. Here we define the contribution of the MmpS5L5 efflux pump to drug resistance in wild-type and Rv0678 mutant strains and show that the commonly used drug verapamil can inhibit MmpS5L5 activity. This suggests that this safe and inexpensive drug may be useful in enhancing bedaquiline treatment of TB and to help prevent bedaquiline acquired resistance."
"Gene expression is constantly regulated by gene regulatory networks that consist of multiple regulatory components to mediate cellular functions. An ideal tool for analyzing gene regulation processes would provide simultaneous measurements of the dynamics of many components in the gene regulatory network, but existing methodologies fall short of simultaneously tracking the dynamics of components over long periods of time. Here, we present CytoTape--a genetically encoded, modular, and scalable analog recorder for continuous, multiplexed in situ recording of gene regulation dynamics over multiple days and weeks at single-cell resolution. CytoTape consists of a flexible, thread-like, elongating intracellular protein self-assembly engineered via AI-guided rational design. Gene regulation dynamics, together with timestamps for reconstruction of the continuous time axis, are directly encoded via distinct molecular tags distributed along single CytoTape assemblies in live cells, to be readout at scale after fixation via standard immunofluorescence imaging. CytoTape recorders are modularly designed to record gene expression driven by a variety of activity-dependent promoters. We demonstrated the utility of CytoTape in mammalian embryonic kidney cells, cancer cells, glial cells, and neurons, achieving simultaneous recording of five cell plasticity-associated transcription factor activities and immediate early gene expression levels, namely CREB, c-fos, Arc, Egr1, and Npas4 activities, within single cells in a spatiotemporally scalable manner. CytoTape revealed complex waveforms and nonlinear temporal couplings among these cellular activities, enabling investigations of how gene regulation histories and intrinsic signaling states shape transcriptional logics. We envision CytoTape to have broad applications in both basic and disease-related cell biology research."
"Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16, one of over 200 known genotypes, is a major cause of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers worldwide. The L1 protein capsid - which represents the exterior shell of the virus - plays essential roles in host cell adhesion and entry, and is the major antigen used in vaccines that protect against HPV. Here we report an all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the intact capsid in explicit solvent, a calculation comprising 16.8 million atoms. The detailed motions and emergent biophysical properties revealed by this simulation provide critical insights into capsid function and immunogenicity, establishing a new platform for rational drug design and antibody engineering."
"BackgroundThe irrational use of antibiotics in poultry production has far-reaching consequences and continues to impact the fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Africa. In Nigeria, antibiotics are available over-the-counter and are widely used in food animal production for various reasons, including prophylaxis and growth promotion. While this practice may support animal production, it also drives the spread of AMR, posing serious health challenges due to close human-livestock interactions and the countrys high disease burden. This study examined poultry farmers knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding antibiotic use and AMR, aiming to highlight the public health risks and challenges in combating AMR in Nigeria.

MethodsA cross-sectional survey of 200 poultry farms in Enugu State, Southeast Nigeria, was conducted to evaluate farmers KAP towards antibiotic usage and AMR. Using a validated, standardized, and self-administered questionnaire, data were collected from farmers responsible for key farm decisions, including input and feed management. The questionnaire comprised three sections: socio-demographic data, knowledge of AMR, and knowledge and practices regarding antibiotic use. Ethical approval was obtained, and participants gave oral consent based on their professional capacity.

ResultsThe evaluation of poultrys farmers KAP regarding antibiotic usage and AMR revealed that the majority of farmers (90.5%) reported using antibiotics, primarily for treating infections (80.5%) or for feed enhancement, growth promotion, and prophylaxis (61%). Ampicillin (75%), ciprofloxacin (71.5%), and doxycycline (71%) were the most commonly administered antibiotics. Monthly administration was the most common (48%), and 89% of respondents believed that antibiotics promote poultry growth. Interestingly, a substantial proportion of respondents (65%) were unaware of AMR, highlighting a significant knowledge gap, with only 16% recognizing the risk of AMR infections.

ConclusionOur study revealed that the surveyed poultry farmers heavily rely on antibiotics, primarily for treating infections and, to a significant extent, for growth promotion, despite their limited awareness of AMR. Ampicillin was identified as the most commonly used antibiotic, raising concerns due to its potential link to beta-lactamase selection amid the countrys carbapenem resistance issues. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted education to address the AMR knowledge gap and reduce the misuse of antibiotics in poultry farming settings in Nigeria."
"Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), the set of fetal and neonatal complications associated with Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnancy, was first noted during the outbreak in the Americas in 2015-16. However, there was an unequal distribution of ZIKV cases and severe outcomes in all areas where ZIKV emerged in the Americas, demonstrating that the risk of CZS varied over space and time. Recently, we demonstrated that phenotypic heterogeneity existed between closely-related ZIKV strains. All ZIKV strains tested infected the placenta but varied in their capacity to cause overt fetal harm. Here, we further characterized the relative contributions of virus genotype and infecting dose of two phenotypically distinct ZIKV strains across multiple timepoints in gestation in pregnant mice that lack type-I interferon receptor function (Ifnar1-/-). To better understand the underlying causes of adverse fetal outcomes, we used RNA sequencing to compare ZIKV-infected and uninfected tissues. We found that ZIKV infection triggers retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor-mediated activation of the interferon response at the maternal-fetal interface. However, modest chemical inhibition of RIG-I activation in the decidua and placenta did not protect against fetal demise. Instead, the fetal interferon response was significantly associated with fetal demise. Together, these findings suggest that the response to ZIKV at the maternal-fetal interface can vary depending on the infecting ZIKV genotype and dose, and that the fetal immune response is an important mediator of fetal harm.

IMPORTANCEPreviously, we used a mouse model of ZIKV infection during pregnancy to assess the pathogenic potential to the fetus of a panel of five, low-passage ZIKV strains representing the viral genetic diversity in the Americas. We found that phenotypic heterogeneity existed between these closely-related ZIKV strains. Here, we show that this heterogeneity is driven by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor-mediated activation of the interferon response at the maternal-fetal interface. We used chemical inhibition of the RIG-I pathway and measured the transcriptional activity of interferon stimulated genes in fetuses to demonstrate that the fetal immune response may contribute to fetal demise."
"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster emerges as an affordable, genetically tractable model of behavior and brain diseases. However, despite the surprising level of evolutionary conservation from flies to humans, significant genetic, circuit-level and behavioral differences hinder the interpretability of fruit fly models for human disease. Therefore, to allow a more direct fly-versus-human comparison, we surveyed the rarely exploited, rich behavioral repertoire of fruit flies with genetic alterations relevant to Parkinsons disease (PD), including overexpression of human mutant Parkin or -synuclein proteins and mutations in dopamine receptors. Flies with different genetic backgrounds displayed variable behaviors, including freezing, slowing and running, in response to predator-mimicking passing shadows used as threatening stimuli in a single-animal trial-based assay. We found that the expression of human mutant Parkin in flies resulted in reduced walking speed and decreased reactivity to passing shadows. Flies with dopamine receptor mutations showed similar alterations, consistent with the motor and cognitive deficits typical in humans with PD. We also found age-dependent trends in behavioral choice during the fly lifespan, while dopamine receptor mutant flies maintained their decreased general reactivity throughout all age groups. Our data demonstrate that single-trial behavioral analysis can reveal subtle behavioral changes in mutant flies that can be used to further our understanding of disease pathomechanisms and help gauge the validity of genetic Drosophila models of neurodegeneration, taking us one step closer to bridging the gap in fly-to-human translation."
"Current flow that gives rise to non-invasive Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data derives predominantly from pyramidal neurons oriented orthogonal to the cortical surface. The estimate of current flow based on extra-cranial magnetic fields is a well-known ill-posed problem; however, this current distribution must depend on anatomy. In other words, a veridical estimate of current flow should discriminate between true and distorted versions of the brain. Here, we make use of advances in diffeomorphic brain shape modelling to construct a set of parametrically deformable cortical surfaces. We use a latent space of 100 components to construct cortical surfaces that are representative of the population. We show how these geometric distortions can be used to quantify the performance of MEG source reconstruction algorithms and metrics of fit."
"ObjectiveTraumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to secondary injury, including axon and myelin damage, which contributes to long-term neurological deficits. The PET tracer [18F]3F4AP, a fluorinated derivative of the FDA-approved drug 4-aminopyridine, selectively binds to voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels, offering a novel approach to assess TBI-related node of Ranvier disruption and demyelination. This study evaluates [18F]3F4AP PET in penetrating and non-penetrating TBI models.

MethodsEither controlled cortical impact (CCI, penetrating) or concussive (non-penetrating) TBI models were used to induce TBI in mice. Dynamic PET imaging with [18F]3F4AP was performed at time points of 0, 3, 7, 14, and/or 31 days post-injury (dpi), with quantitative analyses comparing tracer uptake in injured versus control regions. Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining was conducted to evaluate histological myelin loss.

ResultsIn the CCI model, [18F]3F4AP PET imaging demonstrated a 34% increase in tracer uptake at the injury site at 7 dpi, correlating with histological evidence of demyelination. Tracer uptake gradually declined over time, reflecting potential remyelination. The concussive TBI model showed a smaller and more diffuse increase in uptake at 7 dpi compared to CCI.

Conclusion[18F]3F4AP PET imaging effectively detects demyelination following TBI, with very high sensitivity in penetrating injuries. These findings highlight the potential of [18F]3F4AP as a valuable imaging biomarker for assessing TBI progression and/or therapeutic response. Further studies are warranted to explore its clinical applicability and comparison with other imaging modalities."
"Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) limit the actionability of genetic testing. A prominent example is MUTYH, a base excision repair factor associated with polyposis and colorectal cancer, which has a pathogenic variant carrier rate approaching 1 in 50 individuals in some populations. To systematically interrogate variant function in MUTYH, we coupled deep mutational scanning with a DNA repair reporter containing its lesion substrate, 8OG:A. Our variant-to-function map covers >97% of all possible MUTYH point variants (n=10,941) and achieves 100% accuracy classifying the pathogenicity of known clinical variants (n=247). Leveraging a large clinical registry, we observe significant associations with colorectal polyps and cancer, with more severely impaired missense variants conferring greater risk. We recapitulate known functional differences between pathogenic founder alleles, and highlight sites of complete missense intolerance, including residues that intercalate DNA and coordinate essential Zn2+ or Fe-S clusters. This map provides a resource to resolve the 1,032 existing missense VUS and 90 variants with conflicting interpretations in MUTYH, and demonstrates a scalable strategy to interrogate other clinically relevant DNA repair factors."
"Gram-negative bacteria divide by separating two cell wall layers: peptidoglycan (PG) and the outer membrane (OM). In certain model organisms, the OM is tethered to PG, ensuring it closely follows PG throughout invagination, constriction, and separation. In contrast, Myxococcus xanthus exhibits autonomous OM partitioning, occurring only after complete PG fission. However, reinforcing the OM-PG connection by overexpressing endogenous or exogenous tethering proteins synchronizes the constriction and fission of both layers."
"Planarian regeneration and tissue turnover involve fate specification in pluripotent stem cells called neoblasts. Neoblasts select fates through the expression of fate-specific transcription factors (FSTFs), generating specialized neoblasts. Specialized neoblasts are spatially intermingled and can be dispersed broadly, frequently being far from their target tissue. The post-mitotic progeny of neoblasts, serving as progenitors, migrate and differentiate into mature cell types. Pattern formation is thus strongly influenced by the migratory assortment and differentiation of fate-specified progenitors in precise locations, which we refer to as progenitor targeting. This central step of pattern maintenance and formation, however, is poorly understood. Here, we describe a requirement for the conserved map3k1 gene in targeting, restricting post-mitotic progenitor differentiation to precise locations. RNAi of map3k1 causes ectopic differentiation of eye progenitors along their migratory path, resulting in dispersed ectopic eyes and eye cells. Other neural tissues similarly display ectopic posterior differentiation and pharynx cells emerge dispersed laterally and anteriorly in map3k1 RNAi animals. Ectopic differentiated cells are also found within the incorrect organs after map3k1 RNAi, and ultimately teratomas form. These findings implicate map3k1 signaling in controlling the positional regulation of progenitor behavior - restricting progenitor differentiation to targeted locations in response to external cues in the local tissue environment."
"From an eagle spotting a fish in shimmering water to a scientist extracting patterns from noisy data, many cognitive tasks require untangling overlapping signals. Neural circuits achieve this by transforming complex sensory inputs into distinct, separable representations that guide behavior. Data-visualization techniques convey the geometry of these transformations, and decoding approaches quantify performance efficiency. However, we lack a framework for linking these two key aspects. Here we address this gap by introducing a data-driven analysis framework, which we call Geometry Linked to Untangling Efficiency (GLUE) with manifold capacity theory, that links changes in the geometrical properties of neural activity patterns to representational untangling at the computational level. We applied GLUE to over seven neuroscience datasets--spanning multiple organisms, tasks, and recording techniques--and found that task-relevant representations untangle in many domains, including along the cortical hierarchy, through learning, and over the course of intrinsic neural dynamics. Furthermore, GLUE can characterize the underlying geometric mechanisms of representational untangling, and explain how it facilitates efficient and robust computation. Beyond neuroscience, GLUE provides a powerful framework for quantifying information organization in data-intensive fields such as structural genomics and interpretable AI, where analyzing high-dimensional representations remains a fundamental challenge."
"Bacterial counts from native environments, such as soil or the animal gut, often show substantial variability across replicate samples. This heterogeneity is typically attributed to genetic or environmental factors. A common approach to estimating bacterial populations involves successive dilution and plating, followed by multiplying colony counts by dilution factors. This method, however, overestimates the heterogeneity in bacterial population because it conflates the inherent uncertainty in drawing a subsample from the total population with the uncertainty in the sample arising from biological origins. In other words, this approach may obscure features that may otherwise be present in the data hinting at the presence of genuine subpopulations. For example, in plate counting applied to C. elegans gut microbiota, observed multimodality is often interpreted as large host-to-host variance, while the randomness introduced by measurement is frequently ignored. To explicitly account for the uncertainty introduced by dilution and plating randomness, we introduce REPOP, a PyTorch-based library to REconstruct POpulations from Plates within a Bayesian framework. Beyond simple cases, REPOP addresses more complex scenarios, including multimodal populations and correcting the mathematically subtle, but experimentally relevant, bias introduced by excluding plates deemed too crowded to distinguish individual colonies. We demonstrate REPOPs ability to resolve distinct population peaks otherwise obscured by standard multiplication methods. Applications to both simulated and experimental datasets, including bacterial samples of different concentrations and ones from the gut microbiota of C. elegans, show that REPOP accurately recovers the underlying multimodality by properly accounting for error propagation, where naive multiplication fails. REPOP is available on GitHub: https://github.com/PessoaP/REPOP."
"Detection of somatic mutations in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is challenging due to low variant allele frequencies and pronounced DNA degradation. Here, we present a novel approach and resource for benchmarking of somatic variant calling algorithms in cfDNA samples from cancer patients. Using longitudinally collected cfDNA samples from colorectal and breast cancer patients, we identify patient-matched samples with high and ultra-low circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels. These sample pairs, preserving patient-specific germline and somatic haematopoiesis variant backgrounds, were used to generate dilution series capturing characteristics of bona-fide cfDNA samples. To benchmark the accuracy and limit of detection of 9 somatic variant calling algorithms, we used deep Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS, 150x) and ultra-deep Whole Exome Sequencing (WES, 2,000x) to construct a reference set of [~]37,000 Single Nucleotide Variants and [~]58,000 Insertions/Deletions. We tested methods under variable ctDNA levels and depth of sequencing, generating guidelines for method choice depending on use case. Using a machine learning approach, we further evaluated the potential of fine-tuning individual variant callers, revealing features that may improve accuracy in cfDNA samples. Overall, we present a new resource for benchmarking of somatic variant calling methods in cfDNA, providing insights on method choice to realize the potential of liquid biopsies in precision oncology."
"Phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A) modulators are emerging anticancer agents for tumors that co-express PDE3A and Schlafen 12 (SLFN12), promoting the formation of a cytotoxic PDE3A-SLFN12 complex. The effect correlates with PDE3A and SLFN12 expression levels. In this study, we conducted a high-throughput screening of 526 compounds in three sarcoma cell lines to identify synergistic or antagonistic interactions with PDE3A modulators. Synergistic mechanisms were further investigated in cell lines and in patient-derived xenograft models of leiomyosarcoma and myxofibrosarcoma in mice. Several drug classes showed potential synergy, and PDE3A modulators sensitized cells to otherwise ineffective Bcl-2/xL inhibitors. The combination of a PDE3A modulator and a Bcl-xL inhibitor induced tumor regression in a patient-derived leiomyosarcoma model in vivo. Our findings reveal that PDE3A modulators synergized with several inhibitors of key cancer pathways, offering promising potential for future treatments. With further research, PDE3A modulators and combination therapies could provide effective targeted treatment options for tumors expressing both PDE3A and SLFN12, paving the way for innovative and hopeful advancements in cancer treatment."
"Plants are colonized by a diverse microbiome, with microorganisms residing inside and outside of plant tissues. Plants can harness the protective traits of their microbial inhabitants to ward off insect pests and fungal pathogens. However, current understanding of the role of commensal interactions on activating the desired microbial genomic traits remains limited. Here we show that biosynthesis of the antifungal (L)2-5 dihydro-phenylalanine (DHP) by the endophytic Streptomyces sp. PG2 is strongly induced upon colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana. This protects the plant from infection by the fungal root pathogen Rhizoctonia solani, both in vitro and in vivo. Interaction with sugar beets also enhanced DHP production in Streptomyces sp. PG2. We identified the DHP biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) and showed that heterologous expression of the BGC in DHP non-producer Streptomyces coelicolor conferred plant-inducible DHP production. The BGC was also found in plant-associated Gram-negative bacteria, and in Pseudomonas syringae FF5 we again observed strongly enhanced DHP production upon plant colonization. Collectively, these data provide proof of concept that plant colonization can enhance the biosynthetic potential of root-associated microbe, thereby enhancing plant resilience. This may increase the competitiveness of the microbes within the rhizosphere."
"Unraveling synaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within rhythmic neural circuits, such as central pattern generation (CPG) circuits for rhythmic motor behaviors, is critical for deciphering circuit interactions and functional architecture, which is a major problem for understanding how neural circuits operate. Here we present a general method for extracting and separating patterns of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductances at high temporal resolution from single neuronal intracellular recordings in rhythmically active networks. These post-synaptic conductances reflect the combined synaptic inputs from the key interacting neuronal populations and can reveal the functional connectome of the active circuits. To illustrate the applicability of our analytic technique, we employ our method to infer the synaptic conductance profiles in identified rhythmically active interneurons within key microcircuits of the mammalian (mature rat) brainstem respiratory CPG and provide a perspective on how our approach can resolve the functional interactions and circuit organization of these interneuron populations. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach, which can be applied to any other rhythmic circuits where conditions allow for neuronal intracellular recordings."
"Tissue regeneration enhancer elements (TREEs) direct expression of target genes in injured and regenerating tissues. Additionally, TREEs of zebrafish origin were shown to direct the expression of transgenes in border zone regions after cardiac injury when packaged into recombinant AAV vectors and introduced into mice. Future implementation of TREEs into AAV-based vectors as research tools and potential gene therapy modalities will require a more detailed understanding of expression dynamics and potential off-target effects. Here, we applied in vivo bioluminescent imaging to mice systemically injected with AAV vectors containing different combinations of capsids, enhancers, and timing of delivery. Longitudinal tracking of TREE-based expression over time revealed distinct amplitudes and durations of reporter gene expression in the injured heart directed by different TREEs. The liver-de-targeted AAV capsid, AAV.cc84, was able to deliver TREEs either pre- or post-cardiac injury to negate off-target expression in the liver while maintaining transduction in the heart. By screening AAV9-based capsid libraries dosed systemically in mice post-cardiac injury, we discovered a new capsid variant, AAV.IR41, with enhanced transduction at cardiac border zone regions, and with elevated transduction of TREE driven transgenes versus conventional AAV9 vectors. In vivo bioluminescence imaging offers insights into how enhancers and engineered capsids can be implemented to modulate spatiotemporal transgene expression for future targeted therapies."
"The accuracy of spatial gene expression profiles generated by probe-based in situ spatially-resolved transcriptomic technologies depends on the specificity with which probes bind to their intended target gene. Off-target binding, defined as a probe binding to something other than the target gene, can distort a genes true expression profile, making probe specificity essential for reliable transcriptomics. Here, we investigate off-target binding in the 10x Genomics Xenium v1 Human Breast Gene Expression Panel. We developed a software tool, Off-target Probe Tracker (OPT), to identify putative off-target binding via alignment of probe sequences and found at least 21 out of the 280 genes in the panel impacted by off-target binding to protein-coding genes. To substantiate our predictions, we leveraged a previously published Xenium breast cancer dataset generated using this gene panel and compared results to orthogonal spatial and single-cell transcriptomic profiles from Visium CytAssist and 3' single-cell RNA-seq derived from the same tumor block. Our findings indicate that for some genes, the expression patterns detected by Xenium demonstrably reflect the aggregate expression of the target and predicted off-target genes based on Visium and single-cell RNA-seq rather than the target gene alone. Overall, this work enhances the biological interpretability of spatial transcriptomics data and improves reproducibility in spatial transcriptomics research."
"Targeted inhibition of DNA damage response proteins has received significant clinical attention owing to the success of PARP inhibitors. Due to the loss of the G1/S checkpoint, cancer cells are reliant on the G2/M checkpoint to cope with elevated DNA replication stress. We previously demonstrated a single induction of 8-oxo-guanine at telomeres in cancer cells was sufficient to induce replication stress, but was well tolerated at the cellular level. Here, we found inhibition of ATR, Chk1, or Wee1 after induction of telomere oxidative stress significantly induced genome instability and reduced cell viability. This occurred at doses markedly less than those required to increase instability in non-cancer cells. We determined the mechanism of this instability is due to cells progressing through S-phase with telomere damage and exiting G2-phase prematurely, prolonging their mitosis. This study demonstrates targeted oxidative base damage at telomeres can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of ATR inhibition in cancer."
"The cell fate participants characterization based on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data greatly facilitates the mechanism understandings of cellular differentiation. However, inferring these fate factors dynamics along the pseudotime is challenging. Based on cell-state density and pseudotime regression weights, we present an algorithm TimeFactorKernel (FT-Kernel), to predict the key cell fate factors, not only the minimum lineage transition genes, but also the related genesets/pathways, and cellular interaction dynamics along the pseudotime. By extrapolating the pseudotime-related key genes from spectral data as a pseudotime-kernel, FT-Kernel outperformed previous methods. Beyond time-related genes, FT-Kernel offered a comprehensive analysis of the inferred cellular interactions dynamics and lineage pathways dynamics along the pseudotime, which were limited in other methods. Additionally, it facilitated time-related fate factors prediction across various data modalities. Our work developed an important pseudotime-kernel in predicting the fate factors, and provided insights into the cellular hierarchies during development.

SignificanceUnderstanding cellular changes over time is key to deciphering lifes processes from development to disease. Current single-cell methods miss crucial information by overlooking cell-state density dynamics and thus neglecting rare, low-density transitional states vital for cell fate decisions. TimeFactorKernel, a novel computational tool, overcomes this limitation. By prioritizing genes active in these low-density transitional states and employing machine learning for precise gene identification, TimeFactorKernel provides a powerful new approach to decode cell fate. Validated and widely adopted, TimeFactorKernel also uniquely models cell-cell interactions, opening new avenues for understanding complex biological systems in health and disease.

KeypointsO_LIFT-Kernel is a novel kernel algorithm designed to predict time-related fate factors dynamics from the cell state density and pseudotime regression weights.
C_LIO_LIFT-Kernel can be applied to identify lineage transition key genes, cellular interactions, and the multimodal fate kernel inference of genesets/pathways.
C_LIO_LICompared to other temporal-related kernels, FT-Kernel minimizes the skewness of gene distribution and more accurately captures the state of fate transitions.
C_LIO_LIFT-Kernel is an extensible multimodal framework facilitating to understand the mechanisms of cell differentiation and is available on GitHub.

"Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) activates mitochondrial antiviral signaling proteins, initiating the antiviral response. RIG-I and RNF135, a ubiquitin ligase regulator, are missing in domestic chickens but conserved in mallard ducks. The chickens RIG-I loss was long believed to be linked to increased avian influenza susceptibility. We reinstated both genes in chickens and examined their susceptibility to infection with an H7N1 avian influenza virus. Uninfected RIG-I-expressing chickens exhibited shifts in T and B cells. At the same time, the H7N1 infection led to severe disease, persistent weight loss, and increased viral replication compared to wild-type chickens. The simultaneous expression of RIG-I and RNF135 potentiated the RIG-I activity and was associated with exacerbated inflammatory response and increased mortality without influencing virus replication. Additional animal infection experiments with two other avian influenza viruses validated these findings. They confirmed that the harmful effects triggered by RIG-I or RIG-I- RNF135-expression require a minimum degree of viral virulence. Our data indicate that the loss of RIG-I in chickens has likely evolved to counteract deleterious inflammation caused by viral infection and highlight the outcome of restoring evolutionary lost genes in birds.

Significance StatementThe evolutionary loss of a crucial innate immune sensor like RIG-I in domestic chickens and its presence in closely related avian species such as ducks has long puzzled researchers. We genetically reinstated RIG-I in chickens, alongside its ubiquitination factor, RNF135, to uncover their roles in responding to influenza virus interactions in chickens. Our findings suggest that the loss of RIG-I in chickens may have occurred as an adaptive strategy to mitigate harmful inflammation associated with influenza infection. We shed light on the outcome of reinstating evolutionarily lost genes in birds and open new avenues for understanding immune responses in vertebrates."
"Nucleic acid-binding proteins (NABPs) exhibit cell type-specific regulatory functions, yet their target genes and roles remain incompletely defined due to limitations in current experimental methods. Here, we present a deep learning approach that integrates gene co-expression correlations to predict NABP regulatory targets and infer their functions across diverse cellular contexts, without requiring binding motif information. By replacing low-informative input features in a transcriptome-based prediction model with co-expression-derived interactions, we achieved improved accuracy in gene expression prediction. Functional enrichment analysis revealed biologically coherent annotations aligned with known NABP roles. In parallel, we employed a ChatGPT-assisted interpretation framework that provided functional predictions based on semantic patterns among gene sets--an approach that may offer interpretability even when gene sets are modest in size. Predictions supported by both statistical enrichment and ChatGPT-based inference were less likely to reflect spurious associations, reinforcing their biological relevance. Together, this integrative framework combines deep learning, co-expression networks, and generative AI to uncover both established and previously uncharacterized NABP functions in a cell type-specific manner."
"Affective experiences are inevitably accompanied by physiological changes, however it is still a matter of intense debate whether events evoking similar affective experiences produce comparable physiological responses (fingerprint hypothesis) or variation is the norm within individuals (population hypothesis). We reanalyzed data from two independent samples (N = 491; N = 64), using representational similarity analysis (RSA) to examine the trial-by-trial similarity patterns of subjective experience of valence and arousal and affect-related physiological measures (skin conductance [SCR] and startle blink responses). Across different affect-inducing (passive picture viewing, passive sound listening, imagery tasks) tasks and samples (Ns=491, 64), we observed strong-to-decisive evidence for a correspondence between SCR and startle responses and models of arousal and valence that assume variation, especially between trials generally evoking higher responses. Our results show that similar affective experiences are rather reflected by distinct physiological responses and emphasize the importance of considering intraindividual variability in future studies to better understand how physiological changes contribute to conscious affective experiences in humans."
"Antigenic variability among influenza virus strains poses a significant challenge to developing broadly protective, long-lasting vaccines. Current annual vaccines target specific strains, requiring accurate prediction for effective neutralization. Despite sequence diversity across phylogenetic groups, the hemagglutinin (HA) head domains structure remains highly conserved. Utilizing this conservation, we designed cross-group chimeric HAs that combine antigenic surfaces from distant strains. By structure-guided transplantation of receptor-binding site (RBS) residues, we displayed an H3 RBS on an H1 HA scaffold. These chimeric immunogens elicit cross-group polyclonal responses capable of neutralizing both base and distal strains. Additionally, the chimeras integrate heterotrimeric immunogens, enhancing modular vaccine design. This approach enables the inclusion of diverse strain segments to generate broad polyclonal responses. In the future, such modular immunogens may serve as tools for evaluating immunodominance and refining immunization strategies, offering potential to bridge and enhance immune responses in individuals with pre-existing immunity. This strategy holds promise for advancing universal influenza vaccine development.

"Metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) in pregnancy represent two distinct cardiometabolic populations, each potentially necessitating alternative clinical management. However, the understanding of the unique physiological effects of uncomplicated MHO or MUO on fetoplacental growth and metabolism remains limited. This study aimed to identify changes in placental morphology and metabolites concerning maternal obesity, independent of pregnancy-related cardiometabolic complications. Placentae from women with a pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) <25 kg/m2 (control; n = 15) and women with MHO (pre-pregnancy BMI >30 kg/m2 with no cardiometabolic diseases; n = 15) were analysed for indices of placental growth and untargeted metabolomics. Complementary measures of pro-inflammatory and antioxidant genes, as well as antioxidant proteins, enzymes, and lipid peroxidation markers were conducted. A clear placentomegaly without histopathological changes was observed in uncomplicated MHO pregnancies. The metabolite 3-aminoisobutanoic acid emerged as the top-ranked feature distinguishing MHO from control placentae, and cysteine, methionine, and vitamin B6 metabolism pathways were among the most distinct signatures identified. These findings illustrate an altered placental morphology and metabolomic profile specific to uncomplicated MHO, offering new insights into how obesity without cardiometabolic complications influences fetoplacental growth and metabolism. They also represent a crucial first step towards marker identification for MHO pregnancies and underscore the importance of alternative care pathways when obesity is present but metabolic comorbidities are absent."
"The visual system efficiently encodes information by summarizing visual regularities that could be quantified by summary statistics. While summary statistics are thought to be processed in several cortical and subcortical areas, we investigated whether the earliest stage of visual processing, the pupil, is involved in this process. In three experiments, participants either performed ensemble orientation estimation with or passively viewed bar arrays with different bar orientation distributions while their pupil size was recorded. We found that pupil size increased when the orientation distribution became more dispersed and was closely linked to participants estimation performance. Furthermore, pupillary responses occurred automatically during passive viewing and could even predict ensemble orientation estimation performance. Moreover, when anticipating a dispersed distribution, the pupil dilated in advance. Our findings reveal a new cognitive role of the pupil - it actively and predictively adjusts its size to facilitate the extraction of visual regularity."
"While the cohesin complex is a key player in genome architecture, how it localizes to specific chromatin sites is not understood. Recently, we and others have proposed that direct interactions with transcription factors lead to the localization of the cohesin-loader complex (NIPBL/MAU2) within enhancers. Here, we identify two clusters of LxxLL motifs within the NIPBL sequence that regulate NIPBL dynamics, interactome, and NIPBL-dependent transcriptional programs. One of these clusters interacts with MAU2 and is necessary for the maintenance of the NIPBL-MAU2 heterodimer. The second cluster binds specifically to the ligand-binding domains of steroid receptors. For the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), we examine in detail its interaction surfaces with NIPBL and MAU2. Using AlphaFold2 and molecular docking algorithms, we uncover a GR-NIPBL-MAU2 ternary complex and describe its importance in GR-dependent gene regulation. Finally, we show that multiple transcription factors interact with NIPBL-MAU2, likely using interfaces other than those characterized for GR."
"Establishing if insects feel pain can have far-reaching consequences for insect husbandry, commercial pollination and scientific research. Research in this field therefore requires careful experiments and strong evidence. One important criterion proposed for measuring insect sentience is the ability to show a motivational trade-off, in which ""the negative value of a noxious or threatening stimulus is weighed (traded-off) against the positive value of an opportunity for reward"". A recent paper investigated motivational trade-offs in bumblebees and concluded that bees can trade-off heat against high sugar rewards. In this paper, we develop a signal detection model to highlight which features would be key to supporting the argument that motivational trade-offs are evidence of the capacity for experiencing pain. We then re-analyze the data from the original paper and find several limitations. Our own re-analysis finds no support for the final conclusions made by the paper. We therefore provide recommendations for future studies investigating the ability of insects to feel pain."
"Glycyrrhiza uralensis, known for its diverse pharmacological effects, including immunoregulation, anti-tumor, and antioxidant properties, is a widely used medicinal plant found in more than 70% of traditional herbal medicines (Kampo) in Japan. Although over 300 compounds have been discovered in G. uralensis, the molecular mechanisms underlying its bioactivity remain largely unknown due to the chemical diversity of its compounds. Here, we performed a multiomics analysis incorporating untargeted hydrophilic metabolomics, lipidomics, and phosphoproteomics to elucidate the molecular mechanisms distinguishing the effects of a single bioactive compound, isoliquiritigenin (ILG), and the extract of G. uralensis (GU). Multiomics time-course data were obtained for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells under four experimental conditions: control, LPS(+), LPS(+)/ILG(+), and LPS(+)/GU(+), where 182 hydrophilic metabolites, 381 lipids, and 13,211 phosphopeptides were characterized. The metabolic signatures of inflammatory macrophages, including increased levels of glycolytic intermediates, succinate, citrulline, triacylglycerols, and cholesteryl esters, were attenuated in both the GU(+) and ILG(+) groups. Using a multivariate approach based on a partial least squares algorithm with an imposed inflammation level order information, we identified upregulated phosphorylation of sirtuin 1 and 2 (SIRT1/2) along with alterations in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide metabolism in the ILG(+) group. The inhibition of SIRT2 suppressed the anti-inflammatory effect of ILG, as indicated by a reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Furthermore, we discovered a substantial increase in {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and its downstream metabolite, 4-guanidinobutyric acid, in the GU(+) group. These increases were attributed to endogenous GABA production through glutamic acid decarboxylase rather than uptake via GABA transporters. Exogenous GABA administration significantly suppressed IL-6 and IL-1{beta} expression in LPS-stimulated cells, and the simultaneous administration of GABA and ILG enhanced the anti-inflammatory effects. Consequently, this study presents an approach to elucidating the importance of traditional herbal formulations and demonstrates the utility of multiomics in uncovering that endogenous GABA production would facilitate anti-inflammatory effects with ILG in GU administration."
"Amino acids undergo numerous enzymatic modifications. However, the broad applicability of amino acid-modifying enzymes for synthetic purposes is limited by narrow substrate scope and often unknown regulatory or accessory factor requirements. Here, we characterize ChlH, a flavin-dependent halogenase (FDH) from the chlorolassin biosynthetic gene cluster. Unlike characterized peptide-modifying FDHs, which are limited to either specifically modified peptides or the termini of linear peptides, ChlH halogenates internal Trp residues of linear peptides, as well as N- and C-terminal Trp. Scanning mutagenesis of the substrate peptide ChlA revealed Trp was tolerated by ChlH at nearly every position. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborated the importance of a C-terminal motif in ChlA and provided insight into the lack of Trp14 chlorination in native chlorolassin. Furthermore, halogenation of disparate ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) precursor peptides, pharmacologically relevant peptides, and an internal Trp of a protein was achieved using wild-type ChlH. A rapid cell-free biosynthetic assay provided insight into ChlHs preferences. In contrast to characterized FDHs, ChlH halogenates diverse peptide sequences, and we predict this promiscuity may find utility in the modification of additional peptide and protein substrates of biotechnological value.

Entry for the Table of ContentsChlH, a flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenase, is reconstituted in vitro and found to be capable of modifying a wide array of diverse peptidic substrates despite showing selectivity on its native substrate peptide ChlA. This highlights its potential use in the biocatalytic production of chlorinated peptides.

"Global university rankings have transformed how certain institutions define success, often elevating metrics over meaning. This study examines universities with rapid research growth that suggest metric-driven behaviors. Among the 1,000 most publishing institutions, 98 showed extreme output increases between 2018-2019 and 2023-2024. Of these, 18 were selected for exhibiting sharp declines in first and corresponding authorship. Compared to national, regional, and international norms, these universities (in India, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) display patterns consistent with strategic metric optimization. Key findings include publication growth of up to 965%, concentrated in STEM fields; surges in hyper-prolific authors and highly cited articles; and dense internal co-authorship and citation clusters. The group also exhibited elevated shares of publications in delisted journals and high retraction rates. These patterns illustrate vulnerabilities in global ranking systems, as metrics lose meaning when treated as targets (Goodharts Law) and institutions emulate high-performing peers under competitive pressure (institutional isomorphism). Without reform, rankings may continue incentivizing behaviors that distort scholarly contribution and compromise research integrity."
"Contrastive dimension reduction enhances the analysis of high-dimensional data by generating target-specific low-dimensional representations relative to a background. Emerging methods for contrastive dimension reduction have demonstrated their utility in extracting target-specific signals across domains involving high-dimensional observations, including genomics, transcriptomics, and pattern recognition. However, even though choosing an appropriate background is critical to the success of contrastive dimension reduction, no established criterion currently exists for selecting such backgrounds. To address this gap, we introduce BasCoD, a novel testing framework grounded in the spectral theory of subspace inclusion, to enable rigorous evaluation and optimal selection of backgrounds. Extensive application of BasCoD across diverse single-cell datasets demonstrates its effectiveness in systematically identifying suitable backgrounds, thereby significantly improving the contrast and interpretability of the derived target representations. We further illustrate how BasCoD can facilitate design of appropriate backgrounds in large-scale single cell experiments under heterogeneous conditions."
"To understand the ecophysiology and the role of iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) in various ecosystems, we need to identify marker genes of the iron oxidation pathway to track activity in situ. The Gallionellaceae Sideroxydans sp. CL21, an autotrophic iron-oxidizing bacteria isolated from a peatland, is unusual amongst FeOB isolates in its genomic potential to utilize organic compounds as energy sources. Therefore, it offers the unique opportunity to determine genes expressed under litho- versus organotrophic conditions. We demonstrated the growth of Sideroxydans sp. CL21 on organic substrates (lactate and pyruvate) and inorganic substrates (Fe(II), magnetite, thiosulfate, and S(0)). Thus, cells were capable of lithoautotrophic, organotrophic, and potentially organoheterotrophic growth. Surprisingly, when lactate-grown cells were given Fe(II), mid-log phase cells were unable to oxidize iron, while late-log phase cells oxidized iron. To elucidate iron oxidation pathways, we compared gene expression between mid-log (non-iron-oxidizing) and late-log (iron-oxidizing) lactate-grown cells. Genes for iron oxidases (cyc2, mtoA) were highly expressed at both time points, so did not correspond to iron oxidation capability, making them unsuitable marker genes of iron oxidation activity by themselves. However, genes encoding periplasmic and inner membrane cytochromes were significantly upregulated in cells capable of iron oxidation. These genes include mtoD, cymA/imoA, and a cluster of Fe(II)-responsive genes (ircABCD). These findings suggest Gallionellaceae regulate their iron oxidation pathways in multiple stages, with iron oxidase-encoding genes proactively expressed. Other genes encoding electron carriers are upregulated only when iron oxidation is needed, which makes these genes (i.e. ircABCD) good prospective indicators of iron oxidation ability.

ImportanceFeOB are widespread in the environment and we suspect that they play key roles in nutrient and other elemental cycles. However, with no isotopic marker, we lack the ability to monitor FeOB activity, prompting us to search for genetic markers. Previous work suggests that expression of iron oxidase genes does not directly correspond to iron oxidation activity in Gallionellaceae and little was known about the other genes in the pathway. Here we study a unique FeOB isolate that possesses organotrophic capabilities and demonstrate its potential for mixotrophic growth on lactate and Fe(II). Its ability to oxidize iron is regulated, allowing us to discover potential iron oxidation pathway genes with expression that corresponds to iron oxidation activity. If these genes can be further validated as iron oxidation marker genes, they will enable us to delineate autotrophic and organoheterotrophic FeOB impacts on carbon cycling in wetlands and other natural and engineered environments."
"Many protein sequences occupy similar three-dimensional structures known as protein folds. In nature, protein folds are well-conserved over the course of evolution, such that there are 100,000 times as many extant protein sequences than there are folds. Despite their common shapes, similar protein folds can adopt wide-ranging functions, raising the question: are protein folds so strongly conserved for the purpose of maintaining function-driving energetic changes in protein families? Here we show that a set of key energetic relationships in a family of bacterial transcription factors (TFs) is conserved using high-resolution hydrogen exchange/mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations. We compared the TFs to their anciently diverged structural homologs, the periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs), expecting that protein families that share the same fold and bind the same sugars would have similar energetic responses. Surprisingly, our findings reveal the opposite: the ""energetic blueprints"" of the PBPs and the TFs are largely distinct, with the allosteric network of the TFs evolving specifically to support the functional requirements of genome regulation, versus conserved interactions with membrane transport machinery in PBPs. These results demonstrate how the same fold can be adapted for different sense/response functions via family-specific energetic requirements - even when responding to the same chemical trigger. Understanding the evolutionarily conserved energetic blueprint for a protein family provides a roadmap for designing functional proteins de novo, and will help us treat aberrant protein behavior in conserved domains in disease-related drug targets, where engineering selectivity is challenging."
"Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) and other neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) pose diagnostic challenges due to their diffuse and subtle pathological changes. Traditional diagnostic methods relying on manual histopathological slide inspection are labor-intensive and prone to variability, often missing subtle structural alterations. This study introduces an age-informed, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) pipeline to predict AT8 density, a key marker of p-tau aggregation in CTE. Using Luxol Fast Blue and Hematoxylin & Eosin (LH&E) stained images, our model identifies critical pathological regions and generates interpretable attention maps highlighting structural changes linked to tau pathology. Incorporating patient age enhances predictive accuracy and contextual understanding, addressing agings confounding effects. We also develop quantitative evaluation procedures for foundation models (FMs), assessing attention map smoothness, faithfulness, and robustness to perturbations like stain variability and noise. These benchmarks facilitate informed FM selection and optimization for neuropathological tasks. By enabling scalable, automated whole-slide image (WSI) analysis, our approach advances digital neuropathology, supporting earlier and more precise ND diagnoses and uncovering subtle markers with potential applications in clinical imaging."
"Sex-limited polymorphisms, such as mating strategies in male birds and mimicry in female butterflies, are widespread across the tree of life and are frequently adaptive. Considerable work has been done exploring the ecological pressures and evolutionary forces that generate and maintain genetic variation resulting in alternative sex-limited morphs, yet little is known about their molecular and developmental genetic basis. A powerful system to investigate this is Papilio butterflies: within the subgenus Menelaides, multiple closely related species have female-limited mimicry polymorphism, with females developing either derived mimetic or ancestral non-mimetic wing color patterns. While mimetic color patterns are different between species, each polymorphism is controlled by allelic variation of doublesex (dsx). Across several species, we found that the mimetic and non-mimetic females develop male-like color patterns when we knockdown dsx expression, establishing that dsx controls both sexual dimorphism and polymorphism. We also found that mimetic dsx alleles have unique spatiotemporal expression patterns between two species, Papilio lowii and Papilio alphenor. To uncover the downstream genes involved in the color pattern switch between both species, we used RNA-seq in P. lowii and compared the results to previous work in P. alphenor. While some canonical wing patterning genes are differentially expressed in females of both species, the temporal patterns of differential expression are notably different. Our results indicate that, despite the putative ancestral co-option and shared use of dsx among closely related species, the mimicry switch functions through distinct underlying mechanisms.

AUTHOR SUMMARYUnderstanding how a largely shared genome can encode the potential to develop multiple morphs while simultaneously restricting this potential to one sex has long been of interest to evolutionary and developmental biologists. This phenomenon, called sex-limited polymorphism, is widespread, occurring in organisms like crustaceans, insects, fish, birds, and mammals. Recent empirical work has begun to identify the genes controlling the switch between phenotypes, but the differences between developmental programs leading to those phenotypes remain unclear. Here we use a classic example of sex-limited polymorphism - female mimicry in swallowtail butterflies - to compare how closely related species have evolved to use the same gene, doublesex, in the development of multiple female morphs. Using a combination of functional experiments, we show that despite the shared use of doublesex, the developmental genetics underlying sex-limited polymorphism have evolved to function quite differently between two species that last shared a common ancestor approximately 15 million years ago."
"The antigen specificity of antibodies is defined mainly by their highly-variable complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), of which the CDR3 is considered to be the most important. Similar antibodies are expected to bind the same epitope on an antigen, but how this similarity should be quantified is unclear. Here, we utilized a large body of publicly available data to identify features that are most informative in predicting if two antibodies are likely to bind to the same epitope. We examined features such as pairwise sequence identities, CDR structural similarity, and geometrical similarity of antibody paratopes. We found that, for antibodies with high overall sequence similarity, the CDR sequence identity alone is sufficient to predict if a pair of antibodies binds to the same epitope. Strikingly, the sequence identity of CDR1 and CDR2 had as much or more predictive power than CDR3, which is commonly thought of as the main determinant of antibody specificity. In addition, for antibody pairs with lower overall sequence identity, including structural information led to significant improvements in predictive performance. Guided by these results, we developed BCRMatch (https://github.com/IEDB/BCRMatch) which uses an ensemble machine-learning approach to predict if pairs of antibodies target the same epitope based on antibody sequence alone. This can be applied to identify potential targets of an antibody of interest by comparing it to antibodies with known specificities."
"Human depth perception from 2D images is systematically distorted, yet the nature of these distortions is not fully understood. To gain insights into this fundamental problem, we compare human depth judgments with those of deep neural networks (DNNs), which have shown remarkable abilities in monocular depth estimation. Using a novel human-annotated dataset of natural indoor scenes and a systematic analysis of absolute depth judgments, we investigate error patterns in both humans and DNNs. Employing exponential-affine fitting, we decompose depth estimation errors into depth compression, per-image affine transformations (including scaling, shearing, and translation), and residual errors. Our analysis reveals that human depth judgments exhibit systematic and consistent biases, including depth compression, a vertical bias (perceiving objects in the lower visual field as closer), and consistent per-image affine distortions across participants. Intriguingly, we find that DNNs with higher accuracy partially recapitulate these human biases, demonstrating greater similarity in affine parameters and residual error patterns. This suggests that these seemingly suboptimal human biases may reflect efficient, ecologically adapted strategies for depth inference from inherently ambiguous monocular images. However, while DNNs capture metric-level residual error patterns similar to humans, they fail to reproduce human-level accuracy in ordinal depth perception within the affine-invariant space. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating error patterns beyond raw accuracy, providing new insights into how humans and computational models resolve depth ambiguity. Our dataset and methodology provide a framework for evaluating the alignment between computational models and human perceptual biases, thereby advancing our understanding of visual space representation and guiding the development of models that more faithfully capture human depth perception.

Author summaryUnderstanding the characteristics of errors in depth judgments exhibited by humans and deep neural networks (DNNs) provides a foundation for developing functional models of human brain and artificial models with enhanced interpretability. To address this, we constructed a human depth judgment dataset using indoor photographs and compared human depth judgments with those of DNNs. Our results show that humans systematically compress far distances and exhibit distortions related to viewpoint shift, which remain remarkably consistent across observers. Strikingly, the better the DNNs were at depth estimation, the more they also exhibited human-like biases. This suggests that these seemingly suboptimal human biases could in fact reflect efficient strategies for inferring 3D structure from ambiguous 2D inputs. However, we also found a limit: while DNNs mimicked some human errors, they werent as good as humans at judging the relative order of objects in depth, especially when we accounted for viewpoint distortions. We believe that our dataset and discovery of multiple error factors will drive further comparative studies between humans and DNNs, facilitating model evaluations that go beyond simple accuracy to uncover how depth perception truly works--and how it might best be replicated in computational models."
"The introduction and subsequent detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry is influenced by the virus replication fitness, transmission fitness, and virulence in poultry. These viral fitness parameters are important for implementing surveillance and control measures for poultry. This study investigates the potential application of an avian in vitro model using primary chicken embryo (CEF) and duck embryo fibroblasts (DEF) to identify the viral fitness for a reference panel of eight dominant HPAI clade 2.3.4.4 virus genotypes: four H5N1 viruses isolated between 2021 and 2024, as well as three H5N8 and one H5N6 virus isolated between 2014 and 2020. Infectious virus titre and cytopathogenicity were measured in the primary cell cultures over time and these data were analysed using a mathematical model which delineates cell populations into susceptible, latent, infectious, and dead compartments. In addition to obtaining ""traditional"" virological parameters such as peak virus replication and the time to 50% cell death, eight new parameters, key among those, the infecting time (tinf), generation time (tgen) and basic reproduction number (R0), were estimated using the mathematical model. Collectively, these parameters contribute to virus characterization, enhancing the resolution for comparing genetically similar viruses. This approach can allow for the evaluation of virus virulence, replication fitness, and, ideally, transmissibility fitness across different hosts. This study underscores the potential of integrating avian in vitro models with mathematical modeling and builds towards rapid risk assessments of novel HPAI viruses."
"Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA sequences that make up a sizeable fraction of mammalian genomes yet are often tightly repressed by transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms. During early development, epigenetic reprogramming selectively loosens TE repression, and TE transcription actively contributes to embryogenesis. This raises the question: how can embryos and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) tolerate TE expression without incurring widespread inflammation or DNA damage? Here, we reveal multiple mechanisms that prevent innate immune activation by TE-derived cytosolic DNA, including reduced cGAS/STING expression and signalling, dampening of Type I interferon responses by pluripotency factors, and post-transcriptional restriction of retrotransposition. These layers of protection are essential, as experimental perturbation triggers loss of ESC self-renewal and pluripotency. Our data explain how early development can be permissive to TE expression while safeguarding against harmful effects of TE activity."
"IntroductionJuvenile traumatic brain injury (jTBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability in children. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is most susceptible to injury which leads to deficits in executive function, social behaviors, and cognitive flexibility. Prior research has shown a significant role of the oxytocin (OXT) system in the modulation of social behaviors, and that intranasal OXT (IN-OXT) is potentially neuroprotective. Therefore, we believe IN-OXT could improve functional recovery from a PFC injury.

MethodsAnimals received a single midline cortical contusion bilaterally damaging the medial PFC (mPFC) and immediately given a single dose of IN-OXT, placebo, or no treatment. Animals were assessed using behavioral and histological measures.

ResultsThe results indicated that jTBI significantly impacted the normal development of the OXT system, likely due to deficits in OXT synthesis in the SON. While IN-OXT alleviated these deficits, it had no impact on neuroinflammation. Similarly, behavioral effects of IN-OXT were not consistent. Mild improvements were observed in spatial learning but there were no improvements in spatial memory or social dominance.

DiscussionThese results show that IN-OXT increases OXT levels in the brain via pathways originating in the SON and improved spatial learning."
"Sequential sampling models propose that the repeated sampling of sensory information is a fundamental component of perceptual decision-making. Electroencephalographic investigations in humans have demonstrated motor-independent representations of evidence accumulation, but such observations have seldom been made in neuroimaging studies exploring the neuroanatomical origins of evidence accumulation. Here, we aimed to reveal the neuroanatomical locus of sensory evidence accumulation in the human brain by regressing an electrophysiological marker of evidence accumulation (centroparietal positivity, CPP) against changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal during perceptual decision-making. Our cross-modal imaging approach revealed a cluster within left intraparietal sulcus (IPS), located within putative lateral intraparietal area (region hIP3), for which BOLD signals scaled in relation to the slope of the CPP. Furthermore, the drift rate parameter of a drift diffusion model parametrically modulated BOLD activity within an overlapping region of left IPS. In contrast, parametric modulation by reaction time revealed a distributed fronto-parietal network, demonstrating the utility of our approach for isolating a discrete neuroanatomical locus of evidence accumulation. Together, our findings provide strong support for intraparietal sulcus involvement in the accumulation of sensory evidence during human perceptual decision-making."
"The deep-branching Asgard archaea have emerged as a model to study Eukaryogenesis as they harbor homologs of many of the major eukaryotic protein families. In this study, we use Candidatus Odinarchaeota FtsZs as representatives to understand the probable origin, evolution, and assembly of the FtsZ-Tubulin protein superfamily in Asgard archaea. We have performed a comparative analysis of the biochemical properties and cytoskeletal assembly of FtsZ1 and FtsZ2, the two FtsZ isoforms in the Odinarchaeota metagenome. Our electron microscopy analysis reveals that OdinFtsZ1 assembles into curved single protofilaments, while OdinFtsZ2 forms stacked spiral ring-like structures. Upon sequence analysis, we identified an N-terminal amphipathic helix in OdinFtsZ1, which mediates direct membrane tethering. In contrast, OdinFtsZ2 is recruited to the membrane by the membrane-anchor OdinSepF via OdinFtsZ2s C-terminal tail. Overall, we report the presence of two distant evolutionary paralogs of FtsZ in Odinarchaeota, with distinct filament assemblies and differing modes of membrane targeting mechanisms, namely direct vs SepF-mediated membrane binding. Our findings highlight the diversity of FtsZ proteins in the transitional archaeal phylum Odinarchaeota, providing valuable insights into the evolution and differentiation of tubulin family proteins."
"Recent machine learning techniques have improved connectome-based predictions by modelling complex dependencies between brain connectivity and cognitive traits. However, they typically require large datasets that are costly and time-consuming to collect. To address this, we propose Task-guided GAN II, a novel data augmentation method that uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to expand sample sizes in connectome-based prediction tasks. Our method incorporates a task-guided branch within the Wasserstein GAN framework, specifically designed to synthesize structural connectivity matrices and improve prediction accuracy by capturing task-relevant features. We evaluated Task-guided GAN II on the prediction of fluid intelligence using the NIMH Health Research Volunteer Dataset. Results showed that data augmentation improved prediction accuracy. To further assess whether augmentation can substitute for increasing real-world sample sizes, we conducted additional validation using the HCP WU-Minn S1200 dataset. Task-guided GAN II improved prediction performance with limited real data, with gains of up to twofold augmentation observed. However, excessive augmentation did not result in further improvements, suggesting that augmentation complements, but does not fully replace, real data augmentation. These results suggest that Task-guided GAN II is a promising tool for harnessing small datasets in human connectomics research, improving predictive modelling where large-scale data collection is impractical."
"The type III secretion system (T3SS) is used by Gram-negative bacteria, including important pathogens, to manipulate eukaryotic target cells by injecting effector proteins. Type III secretion and bacterial physiology are known to be tightly interconnected and influence each other. Most notably, secreting cells undergo growth arrest in the T3SS model organisms Yersinia, Salmonella and Shigella. The molecular basis of this phenotype, referred to as secretion-associated growth inhibition, is debated. In Yersinia, T3SS genes are encoded extra-chromosomally in the plasmid of Yersinia virulence (pYV), whose copy number increases upon induction of T3SS secretion. In this study, we characterize the link between T3SS activity and subcellular organization by localizing and quantifying the pYV and chromosomal DNA in Yersinia enterocolitica. We find that activation of secretion not only increases the number of pYV plasmids per bacterium, but that the plasmids also move towards the membrane and poles. This relocalization is not caused by transertion (coupled transcription, translation and translocation) of effectors, but part of a broader DNA rearrangement, leading to a distinct relocalization of chromosomal DNA to mid-cell. We hypothesize that these striking DNA rearrangements occurring during secretion are a main factor in the secretion-associated growth inhibition of pathogenic bacteria."
"Artificial selection has greatly shaped crop agronomic traits; however, the mechanistic basis of immunity selection has remained elusive. This study identifies a new rice NLR XA48 and its downstream transcription factor OsVOZ1, which confer bacterial blight resistance. XA48 perceives an ancient pathogen effector, XopG, to activates effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The XA48-OsVOZ1 module has undergone subspecies-specific selection. Xa48 is retained in indica but functionally lost in japonica rice. OsVOZ1 has also diverged into two haplotypes, indica kept both OsVOZ1A/S alleles that match XA48; while japonica only inherited OsVOZ1A that greatly decreases yield when Xa48 is reintroduced into japonica, mechanistically explaining the Xa48 loss in japonica. We resurrected wild rice broad-spectrum resistance by stacking XA48-mediated ETI with XA21-mediated pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Thus, our study reveals that the asymmetric selection of an NLR-TF module shapes both disease resistance and reproduction, and provides a paradigm for breeding crops by harnessing the immunity of wild relatives."
"Perceptually driven behavioral choices are thought to develop gradually from sensation to perception in somatosensory cortex to guide decision-making in higher order cortical areas. Primary somatosensory cortex wS1 of rodents related to their mystacial whiskers has been a model system to study this information flow. However, the role of wS1 in this process is often debated based on controversial results of loss-of-function behavioral experiments that often require prolonged training and movement restraints. Here, to elucidate the role of wS1 in decision-making, we develop an ethological whisker-guided virtual reality (VR) paradigm that closely mimics natural navigation in underground burrows. Untrained mice are navigating at high speed the left and right turns by sensing VR walls with just a pair of their C2 whiskers. We inactivate less than 200 neurons in layer 4 of C2 barrel that results in loss of ability to produce turns contralateral to the lesion. Using probabilistic model of collision avoidance in the presence of noise and uncertainties we hypothesize that wS1 is involved in a feedback control loop that requires continuous updates and predictions to infer the optimal path for collision avoidance."
"BackgroundThe rise of bacterial resistance has driven the exploration of novel therapies, such as bacteriophage-antibiotic cocktails (PACs), which have shown in vitro promise against resistant pathogens, including daptomycin non-susceptible (DNS-MRSA) strains. While daptomycin has been a cornerstone for treating MRSA bacteremia and vancomycin-refractory infective endocarditis, the emergence of DNS-MRSA presents a significant challenge due to high morbidity, mortality, and rapid intrinsic resistance development.

MethodsPhages Intesti13 and Sb-1, were selected for their unique host ranges and activity against sixteen DNS-MRSA strains. Synergy with antibiotics was assessed via growth suppression curves and 24-hour time-kill assays (TKAs) across administration sequences and MIC increments. Selected regimens were further assessed in an ex-vivo simulated endocardial vegetation (SEV) models, with pharmacokinetic analyses confirming target antibiotic concentrations.

ResultsIn the ex-vivo SEV model, simultaneous PAC administration using daptomycin{+/-}phage, showed superior bactericidal activity over sequential treatments in isolate C6 (p<0.01). Similarly, in the same model, C2 reached detection limits within 48h and remained suppressed for 120h (p<0.0037). Sequential outcomes varied by phage-antibiotic order and antibiotic choice. Simultaneous and phage-first regimens outperformed antibiotic-first, especially in 24h TKAs, but showed variability at lower MICs and between in-vitro and ex-vivo settings.

ConclusionThis study highlights PACs potential for DNS-MRSA treatment, emphasizing the importance of administration timing. The observed differences across clinical strains emphasize the need for strain-specific evaluations and a deeper understanding of phage-antibiotic interactions to optimize therapy. Future research must focus on expanding phage diversity, refining protocols, and clinically validating sequential strategies to enhance PAC efficacy."
"Early-life experiences can have profound and long-lasting effects on adult phenotype and thereby Darwinian fitness, though the mechanisms driving these effects remain poorly understood. Epigenetic alterations, especially DNA methylation which affects gene expression, potentially mediate developmental condition effects on adult phenotype. We tested for such effects using captive zebra finches that were reared in either small or large broods, a manipulation that is known to have pleiotropic phenotypic effects. Analyzing whole genome DNA methylation patterns in erythrocytes from 50 individuals sampled in adulthood, we found 0.8% of all CpG sites after filtering to be differentially methylated after correction for multiple testing. We identified 149 non-transiently differentially methylated sites (DMSs) where the DNA methylation difference between treatments was larger than 25%. These DMSs were located in 19 autosomal chromosomes, in or near genes involved in critical biological processes such as cell growth, division, and differentiation, regulation of immune response, muscle contraction, and neuronal signaling. These findings suggest that epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation potentially mediate long-term effects of early-life adversity via differential gene expression, but follow-up studies are needed to identify the extent to which the observed DMSs are functionally related to the previously observed phenotypic effects."
"Basal ganglia play a crucial role in motor control and the challenges posed by pathological oscillations, especially in Parkinsons disease. Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effective in attenuating pathological frequencies, it often leads to side effects. This study presents a comprehensive framework for understanding and improving neural oscillation dynamics by integrating nanomaterials with DBS. Nanomaterials with their controllable frequencies through length, width, and structure could stabilize oscillations and maintain normal neural frequencies. This study introduces three mathematical models: the DBS model, the nanomaterials model, and a combined model of both, which use the Van der Pol delay model to demonstrate how the periodic force and nanomaterials collaborate to stabilize brain activity. Numerical simulations indicate that DBS by itself lowers harmful frequencies but might make the motor cortex unstable because it increases the strength of signals. In contrast, the nanomaterial models reduce the amplitude and activate the motor cortex. The combination of DBS and nanomaterials significantly improves stability, reduces pathological oscillations, and decreases hyperactivity. The use of nanomaterials must be carefully monitored to ensure that they do not suppress normal neural activity, highlighting the need for experimental validation. This study provides a promising direction for the development of personalized therapeutic technologies that balance the suppression of pathological activity with the preservation of normal neural function."
"Fire blight, caused by the bacterium Erwinia amylovora, represents a significant threat to apple (Malus domestica) production. Currently, only a limited number of genes effectively involved in resistance to E. amylovora have been identified.

Seeking new resistance candidates, we focused on a multigene family encoding amaranthin-like lectins, which are highly upregulated following chemical elicitation by acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM). These lectins are believed to contribute to downstream defense by promoting bacterial aggregation, which led to their designation as M. domestica agglutinins (MdAGG). When loss-of-function editions were introduced into MdAGG genes, the plants ability to mount a fully effective defense response against fire blight upon ASM treatment was compromised, confirming the role of MdAGGs in fire blight resistance. Next, we coupled the pPPO16 promoter, endogenous to apple and known to be rapidly induced during E. amylovora infection, with the coding sequence of MdAGG10 to create apple lines with fire blight-inducible MdAGG10 expression. Early MdAGG10 expression in these lines significantly improved resistance to fire blight, and an additional ASM treatment further enhanced this resistance.

In summary, we conclude that MdAGGs act as defense genes whose timely expression can provide effective resistance against E. amylovora."
"Here, we present a fiber-optic dispersive wave generator for highly-efficient, wavelength-tunable ultrashort pulse generation, enabling multicolor deep-tissue two-photon imaging of neuronal and vascular structures in labeled mouse brain. Guided by comprehensive numerical simulations, a compact Yb:fiber laser-driven system is constructed that utilizes precisely parameter- and phase-matching-controlled dispersive wave generation in a photonic crystal fiber. The system delivers sub-100 fs pulses with over [~]6.7 nJ of energy across a continuously tunable spectral range of 880-950 nm, achieving a record-high optical conversion efficiency of up to 65%. Optimizing the output for two-photon excitation of enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein and SYTOX Orange enables high-resolution structural imaging in mouse hippocampus and cerebellum at depths exceeding 450 {micro}m. This technique for wavelength-tunable, high-energy and ultrashort pulse generation with record optical efficiency represents a significant advancement in ultrafast fiber laser technology for versatile biomedical two-photon imaging applications."
"Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), a pioneering class of heterobifunctional ligands, have emerged as transformative tools in combating cancer and immune-related diseases due to their ability to target previously undruggable proteins and overcome drug resistance. Accurate assessment of the degradation potential of PROTACs is essential for advancing their therapeutic applications. However, the development of robust predictive models is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale datasets and domain-specific tools, as well as the underutilization of existing unlabeled data. To address these challenges, we developed an innovative method called AiPROTAC to predict the degradation capacity of PROTACs. In particular, AiPROTAC integrates graph augmentation, message-passing enhanced encoders and cross-attention mechanisms within a contrastive learning framework. Moreover, AiPROTAC leverages a curated specialized dataset combined with the PROTAC-DB dataset to enhance prediction accuracy. Experimental results across two datasets and six evaluation metrics demonstrate that AiPROTAC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models. Further case studies underline its superior sensitivity and reliability. Notably, AiPROTAC facilitated the design of a novel androgen receptor (AR) degrader, PROTAC GT19, which achieved enhanced in vitro degradation compared to Bavdegalutamide (ARV-110). This advancement highlights our AiPROTACs potential to accelerate PROTAC-based therapeutic development and optimization."
"Xylariales is one of the largest and most ecologically diverse fungal orders that is well-known for its chemical diversity. Enhanced secondary metabolism of Xylariales taxa is associated with increased gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), especially in generalist taxa with both greater saprotrophic abilities and broader host ranges as foliar endophytic symbionts. Thus, one hypothesis for BGC diversification among more generalist fungi is that diverse competitive interactions--in both their free-living and symbiotic life stages with many hosts--may exert selective pressure for HGT and a diverse metabolic repertoire. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics to examine how competition (pairwise co-cultures) between seven xylarialean fungi influenced their metabolite production. Of the >9,000 total features detected, 6,115 and 2,071 were over-represented in co-cultures vs. monocultures, respectively. For each strain, each additional co-culture interaction resulted in an 11-14-fold increase in metabolite richness compared to monocultures, reflecting the limited amount of metabolite overlap among different co-culture combinations. Phylogenetic relatedness and BGC content did not impact the diversity of metabolites produced in co-culture; however, co-cultures between more ecologically distinct fungi elicited the strongest metabolic response. Overall, the diversity, specificity, and putative bioactivity of metabolites over-represented only in co-culture supports the role of widespread and diverse competitive fungal interactions to drive xylarialean metabolic diversification. Additionally, as fungal-produced plant hormones were only detected in co-culture, our results reveal the potential for in planta interactions among fungal endophytes to influence the host plant.

ImportanceSaprotrophic and endophytic xylarialean fungi are among the most prolific producers of bioactive secondary metabolites, with numerous industrial uses as antibiotics, pharmaceuticals, and insecticidal toxins. Fungal secondary metabolites are typically encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (sets of physically clustered genes), but the products of most clusters are unknown as the genes are not active in typical culture conditions. Co-cultures can help to ""turn on"" fungal secondary metabolite production, yet factors that can influence co-culture outcomes are largely unknown. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics to assess how differences in genomic content, ecology, and phylogenetic relatedness among seven diverse xylarialean fungal strains impact metabolic production in co-culture. As expected, co-culturing significantly increased metabolite diversity, as well as the abundance of putatively bioactive metabolites. Each new pairwise combination produced different metabolites, indicative of strain-specific responses to competitors. This new information will enable further characterization of the immense biotechnological potential of xylarialean fungi."
"Two-photon light sheet microscopy offers great potential for a range of biological applications. Still, its practical implementation is impeded by the high cost of laser sources, the complexity of construction, and the challenges associated with adapting to existing microscope setups. Here, we release an open-source design that addresses these limitations by providing detailed building instructions for transforming a brightfield microscope into a versatile one- and two-photon light sheet system. Our design incorporates a specially designed broadband hollow core fiber, enabling the simultaneous utilization of visible laser alongside an expansive pulsed laser source from another setup. This integration allows for uncompromised image resolution and speed. Furthermore, the design reduces the complexity of construction, alignment, and overall cost, thereby significantly enhancing the accessibility of this technology (https://github.com/LJPZebra/OLU)."
"Listening engagement plays a crucial role in effective communication and knowledge transfer, reflecting a state of deep absorption in an auditory stimulus. The available behavioral assessments of listening engagement are limited in capturing its multidimensional nature. Measuring listening engagement objectively using brain and body signals is a compelling alternative. In particular, interpersonal synchronization--observed through synchronized physiological responses among listeners--may offer a promising objective measure. In this study, we examined synchronization of brain activity, heart rate, and electrodermal activity between participants while they listened to engaging and non-engaging stories. Subjective engagement ratings were collected as a ground truth reference. Results showed higher interpersonal synchronization across all modalities when participants listened to engaging stories compared to non-engaging ones, with significant correlations between synchronization measures and ratings of subjective engagement. These results confirm that synchronization may be a reliable, objective marker of listening engagement. We anticipate that these results will provide a powerful framework for future research in relevant domains, including education, audiology, and communication science, and enable impactful real-world applications, such as automatically tracking audience engagement in education, entertainment, and broader societal contexts.

Significance StatementWe provide the first direct empirical evidence that interpersonal physiological synchronization serves as a robust and reliable marker of listening engagement. Using a novel experimental paradigm with ecologically valid auditory stimuli, we demonstrate that heightened engagement leads to increased neural and physiological synchronization among listeners, while disengagement reduces it. This objective measure significantly correlates with established behavioral assessments, validating its relevance and reliability. Our innovative approach offers a powerful framework for future research in the relevant domains (education, audiology and communication science) and enables impactful real-world applications, such as automatic tracking of audience engagement in education, entertainment, and broader societal domains."
"BackgroundThe important industrial bast fibre crop jute (Corchorus sp.) is renowned for its long lignocellulosic multi-utility fibres. Information on jute lignin pathway, fibre lignification and related enzymes remains limited. One such key enzyme integral to the final lignification steps is laccase (EC 1.10.3.2).

ResultsA whole-genome search of white jute (Corchorus capsularis) revealed 34 putative laccase (CcaLAC) genes. Phylogenetic analysis categorized these genes into six groups, 17 predominantly expressed in phloem tissue, 9 in leaf, and 4 in xylem and roots. The expression of several CcaLACs increased steadily from plantlet to crop harvest stage. Homology-based selection with Arabidopsis laccase (AtLACs), shortlisted CcaLACs involved in lignin polymerisation. Transcriptomics data confirmed their phloem specific expression, with some showing significantly lower expression in dlpf, a low-lignin fibre-containing white jute mutant. CcaLAC expression also responded to abiotic stresses like ABA hormone and copper heavy metal. Additionally, Ath-miR397a and Ath-miR397b target sites were predicted in 11 and 9 CcaLACs, respectively, suggesting microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation. Subcellular localization showed CcaLACs occupying multiple plant cell compartments. Protein structure predictions revealed up to 10 motifs in CcaLACs, with 18 containing transmembrane helices. Gene ontology (GO) term analysis linked CcaLACs to lignin and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.

ConclusionsBased on expression patterns under different test conditions CcaLAC28 and CcaLAC32 are strong candidates for phloem (bast) fiber lignification process in white jute. Targeted modification of these genes could enhance our understanding of lignification and facilitate the development of low-lignin jute fibres for high-value industrial applications."
"Cargo transport within cells is a vital biological process that relies on the intricate interplay between motor proteins, microtubules, and the complex intracellular environment. In this study, we unveil a universal transport mechanism characterized by stick-slip motion, which governs the dynamics of intracellular vesicle transport. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of vesicle trajectories across various cell types and intracellular environments, we demonstrate that the cargo velocities consistently follow a Gamma distribution, revealing a common statistical pattern amidst the diversity of biological cargoes. Our experimental findings are well-described by a theoretical model that connects the Brownian-correlated kinetic friction between motor-cargo complexes and their surroundings to the observed universal Gamma distribution of cargo velocities. This model elucidates the stick-slip dynamics governing intracellular cargo transport, which are pertinent to various cellular processes such as vesicle budding, organelle transport, and cell migration."
"Pulmonary infection after inhalation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes tuberculosis (TB). TB presents with lung granulomas - complex spheroidal structures composed of immune cells and bacteria. Granulomas often have centralized caseum (necrotic tissue) where mycobacteria are quarantined, complicating and prolonging multi-antibiotic regimens. Determining which antibiotic regimens are optimal for reducing treatment time and toxicity is a goal of recent TB eradication campaigns. Clinical trials are expensive and challenging, making it difficult to untangle which host-pathogen interactions drive the heterogeneous infection and treatment outcomes observed at between-host and within-host scales. To determine responses to antibiotic regimens, we simulate treatments in HostSim, our whole-host mechanistic, multi-scale computational model of Mtb-infection. HostSim tracks dynamics of pulmonary Mtb-infection over molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, and whole-host scales. We create a heterogenous virtual cohort, comprising distinct hosts, for virtual clinical trials. We represent drug treatments by newly-integrating pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics into HostSim, simulating treatment with commonly-prescribed TB antibiotic regimens (e.g., HRZE or BPaL). Our approach allows us to identify both (1) which hosts/granulomas most improve with treatment, and (2) which mechanisms influence outcome heterogeneity. By tracking experimental and clinical measurements, we virtually recreate several drug rankings from literature. We find that many methods of ranking treatment efficacy are strongly influenced by the  definition of improvement used and, in some cases, the detection threshold of CFU. Other rankings depend on initial bacterial burden of hosts/granulomas. Our work suggests that metrics for regimen optimality may be orthogonal, which could explain seemingly-contradictory findings from prior studies."
"Tabin et al1 suspect a high error rate and abnormal error content in the MZR genome data from our published study2, from which they raised concerns about the reliability and useability of our published sequences. Given the poor environmental conditions (such as warm climate and acidic soil in the low latitude area of Southwest China), as well as the non-ideal fossil material (cranium) for DNA extraction, we argue that a relatively high level of aDNA damage, as well as possible artefacts from extraction, library construction and sequencing better explain the observed pattern by Tabin et al in MZR rather than modern DNA contamination. Particularly, we think the mutation motif of the MZR mtDNA, derived from our careful manual check, should be reliable. In addition, we provide additional analyses showing how we minimize the effect of aDNA damage in population analyses."
"Plasticity can help populations cope with environmental changes namely by exploring different ecological niches. Addressing plasticity for nutritional responses in a range of fruit hosts potentially used by Drosophila may be essential in predicting the capacity of insects to colonize new environments or return to ancestral ones. Here we test for differences in oviposition performance, reproductive success and juvenile viability in different host fruits in the colonizing species Drosophila subobscura Collin, and compare them with those of the laboratory maintenance medium to which populations adapted for [~]150 generations. We question: does Drosophila subobscura show plasticity associated with different fruit hosts? Is performance better in the long-term maintenance (control) medium? We observed a higher fecundity, reproductive success and juvenile viability of flies maintained in the fruit media versus the control, but no differences between fruits. Our experiment shows that long-term lab populations of Drosophila subobscura can still assess environmental cues of new substrates allowing for flexible adaptive plasticity to occur through increased fecundity and reproductive success in fruit hosts relative to the control conditions. Importantly, this ability was not lost during long-term evolution in a benign, homogeneous environment. Furthermore, the high performance across fruits reinforces its status as a generalist species and further attests its potential to colonize different ecological settings."
"Recent advances in computational biology have enabled solutions to the inverse folding problem - finding an amino acid sequence that folds into a target structure. An open question concerns the design of proteins that in addition to having the correct target structure also have precisely tuned kinetic properties, such as folding and unfolding rates. To address this problem, we formulate the inverse folding problem as a quest for a sequence with a target free energy landscape. To propose a procedure to address this problem, here we describe the Inverse Folding Molecular Dynamics (IF-MD) method, which combines inverse folding with enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and Bayesian optimization. IF-MD leverages ensemble averages from molecular dynamics simulations, reweighted according to a Bayesian framework, to guide the design of sequences exhibiting specific kinetic properties. We demonstrate the methodology by optisising the binding kinetics of H11, a nanobody against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), thus identifying nanobody variants with slower unbinding kinetics than H11. Mechanistic analysis reveals that this kinetic property arises from a shift towards configurations closer to the bound state and increased free energy barriers for dissociation. These findings highlight the power of IF-MD for efficiently navigating the vast sequence space to design proteins with a tailored free energy landscape."
"To rapidly evaluate the effects of anticancer treatments in 3D models, an integrated approach is proposed, combining a droplet-based microfluidic platform for spheroid formation and single-spheroid chemotherapy application, label-free morphological analysis, and machine learning to assess treatment response. Morphological features of spheroids, such as size and color intensity, are extracted and selected using the Multivariate Information-based Inductive Causation (MIIC) algorithm, and used to train a neural network for spheroid classification into viability classes, derived from metabolic assays performed within the same platform as a benchmark.

The model was tested on Ewing sarcoma cell line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells, demonstrating robust performance across datasets. It accurately predicts spheroid viability, used to generate dose-response curves and to determine half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values comparable to traditional biochemical assays. Notably, a model trained on cell line spheroids successfully classifies PDX spheroids, highlighting its adaptability.

Compared to convolutional neural network-based approaches, this method works with smaller training datasets and provides greater interpretability by identifying key morphological features. The droplet platform further reduces cell requirements, while single spheroid confinement enhances classification quality. Overall, this label-free experimental and analytical platform is confirmed as a scalable, efficient, and dynamic tool for drug screening."
"Understanding the functional impact of genomic sequence variants is critical for evaluating the role of genetic variation in the host response during tuberculosis (TB) disease and anti-TB treatment (ATT). Hitherto, there have been no genome-wide in vivo response expression quantitative trait loci (reQTL) studies conducted for active TB and ATT. Here, using longitudinal peripheral blood RNA-seq data from n = 48 patients with active TB who underwent ATT, we call sequence variants directly from these transcriptomes and impute them with a multi-ancestry reference panel. Associating our variants with the expression of nearby genes, we characterise thousands of cis-eQTL and hundreds of reQTL. We further show significant changes in cell type proportions during ATT through deconvolution of the bulk RNA-seq data and identify the putative cell type specific nature of cis-eQTL. Our work sheds light on the immunogenetics of TB disease and treatment, while providing a framework for studies using only RNA-seq data."
"BackgroundWe recently identified a molecular mechanism involving beta-adrenergic 1 and 2 receptors ({beta}1/2) in the development of TH17 lymphocytes. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of these receptors in combination, but not separately, impaired the ability of T-lymphocytes to produce proinflammatory interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and instead promoted the production of protective Treg cells that secrete anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10). However, it remained unclear whether this regulatory mechanism could serve as a novel therapeutic approach for autoimmune disorders mediated by IL-17A-producing T-lymphocytes.

MethodsMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by an autoimmune response where both T-lymphocytes and IL-17A are implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Using an animal model of MS, termed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we addressed the impact of beta adrenergic receptor blockade (genetically and pharmacologically) on EAE disease progression, severity, and TH17/Treg balance.

ResultsThe genetic deletion {beta}1/2 receptors, either systemically or specifically in T-lymphocytes, significantly attenuated EAE disease severity and animal weight loss. Pharmacological blockade of {beta}1/2 receptors with either propranolol (lipophilic) or nadolol (aqueous) limited disease severity and weight loss similar to the genetic models. All models showed degrees of shifted TH17/Treg balance (suppressing TH17 and promoting Treg) and decreased T-lymphocyte IL-17A production. Importantly, pharmacological blockade was initiated at the time of symptom development, which mimics the typical time where diagnosis of disease would occur.

ConclusionsOur data depict a novel role for {beta}1/2 adrenergic signaling in the control of TH17/Treg cells in EAE. These findings provide new insight into the disease progression as well as provide a potential new pharmacological therapy for IL-17A-related autoimmune diseases."
"The prevalence of cardiometabolic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) continues to grow, representing over half of heart failure cases in the United States. As no specific medication for HFpEF exists, treatment guidelines focus on the management of comorbidities related to metabolic syndrome (e.g. obesity, diabetes, hypertension) that promote the disease1. These same comorbidities also drive pathology in non-cardiac tissues, and the links between cardiometabolic disease presentations in different organs are increasingly being recognized. Preclinical studies on the potential crosstalk between HFpEF and metabolic disease in the liver (e.g. metabolic dysfunction-associated liver disease; MASLD) have focused on how liver dysfunction may affect the heart, particularly through the release of secreted liver proteins. This may reflect the situation in the clinic, where incident MASLD is a risk factor for future HFpEF development. Here, in contrast to this developing paradigm of liver-initiated cardiac disease, we report for the first time a defect in cardiac metabolism related to the mitochondrial metabolic protein GCN5L1 that drives hepatic steatosis and MASLD in HFpEF."
"Structural variants (SVs) are increasingly recognized as key drivers of bacterial evolution, yet their role has not been explored thoroughly. This is due to limitations in traditional short-read sequencing and linear reference-based analyses, which can miss complex structural changes. Tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a major global health concern. In this study, we harness long-read sequencing technologies and genome graph tools to construct a Mtb pangenome reference graph (PRG) from 859 high-quality, diverse, long-read assemblies. To enable accurate genotyping of SVs leveraging the PRG, we developed miniwalk, a tool that outperforms a traditional linear genome-based approach in precision for SV detection. We characterize patterns of structural variation genome-wide, revealing a virulence-associated ESX-5 deletion to be recurrent across the phylogeny, and fixed in a sub-lineage of L4. Systematic screens for additional genes that are recurrently affected by SVs implicated those related to metal homeostasis, including a copper exporter fixed in the widely distributed L1.2.1 sub-lineage. Lastly, we genotyped 41,134 isolates and found SVs putatively associated with resistance to various first and second-line drugs. These findings underscore the broader role of SVs in shaping Mtb diversity, highlighting their importance in both understanding evolution and designing strategies to combat drug-resistant TB."
"Predicting transitions between health, disease, and death across biological systems remains an important challenge with significant implications for both ecological management and medical intervention. Although the principles underlying these transitions are increasingly recognized, accurate and tractable dynamical indicators of health-to-disease transitions remain rare, especially at the level of individual organisms. Here we show that machine learning models using slowing down indicators and permutation entropy can effectively discriminate between groups of individual Drosophila melanogaster that either live or die following experimental bacterial infection. By analysing high-resolution time-series of locomotor activity data from infected fruit flies, we find that individual dynamical indicators, such as the mean, variance, autocorrelation, and permutation entropy, did not differ markedly between flies that survived and those that died during the experiment. However, when these indicators were used to train a Random Forest model, the classifier performed well (AUC = 0.85), demonstrating an accuracy of 81.82% in discriminating between infected flies that would die from infection and those that would survive. Our findings show that combining these simple statistical indicators with machine learning enhances the ability to predict health deterioration in the Drosophila model. This integrated approach not only supports the feasibility of using slowing down indicators and permutation entropy in real-time health monitoring but also provides a framework for applying these methods to the deterioration of health in individuals in a variety of ecological and clinical environments."
"Human herpesviruses (HHVs) are widespread pathogens that can cause severe disease, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, and have been increasingly associated with chronic conditions such as Alzheimers disease and multiple sclerosis. Most antiviral therapies target the -subfamily of HHVs, while treatment options for the {beta}- and {gamma}-subfamilies remain limited. A key antiviral target in -subfamily is the helicase-primase complex (HPC), which is essential for viral DNA replication; however, its structure and inhibition mechanism have remained unclear. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of the HPC from human herpesvirus 1 (HHV1) bound to single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) and either of two clinical inhibitors, amenamevir or pritelivir. The HPC comprises flexible helicase and primase modules, and both inhibitors engage a shared allosteric pocket near the ATPase site. Structural, biochemical, and molecular dynamics analyses reveal that these inhibitors lock the helicase in an open, inactive conformation, thereby preventing ATP binding and DNA unwinding. Furthermore, quantitative interaction energy analysis by fragment molecular orbital (FMO) calculation elucidates why these inhibitors are -subfamily selective and how subtle chemical differences between amenamevir and pritelivir lead to distinct antiviral spectra. Our findings clarify the inhibition mechanism of clinically relevant HPC inhibitors and provide a structural basis for their subfamily selectivity. This framework may guide the rational design of next-generation inhibitors with altered herpesvirus specificity and provide broader insights into the development of helicase-targeted therapeutics."
"Prior studies have shown that approximately 40% of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) patients harbor immune signaling defects in their blood at diagnosis, and the presence of these defects predicts overall survival. Therefore, it is of interest to quantitatively characterize and measure signaling errors in immune signaling systems in these patients. Here we propose a novel approach combining communication theory and signal processing concepts to model ligand discrimination in immune cells in the peripheral blood. We use the model to measure the specificity of ligand discrimination in the presence of molecular noise by estimating the probability of error, which is the probability of making a wrong ligand identification. We apply our model to the JAK/STAT signaling pathway using high dimensional spectral flow cytometry measurements of transcription factors, including phosphorylated STATs and SMADs, in immune cells stimulated with several cytokines (IFN{gamma}, IL-2, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-10) from 19 ER+ breast cancer patients and 32 healthy controls. In addition, we apply our model to 10 healthy donor samples treated with a clinically approved JAK1/2 inhibitor. Our results show reduced ligand identification accuracy and higher levels of molecular noise in BC patients as compared to healthy controls, which may indicate altered immune signaling and the potential for immune cell dysfunction in these patients. Moreover, the inhibition of JAK1/2 produces ligand misidentification and molecular noise rates similar to, or even greater than, those observed in breast cancer. These results suggest a means to improve the use of signaling kinase inhibitor therapies by identifying patients with favorable ligand discrimination specificity profiles in their immune cells.

One Sentence SummaryWe use a communication model to measure ligand discrimination errors in immune cells and molecular noise in cytokine signaling in ER+ breast cancer patients as compared to healthy controls."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been used to study the compositional regularities of proteins in nature, enabling it to assist in protein design to improve the efficiency of protein engineering and reduce manufacturing cost. However, in industrial settings, proteins are often required to work in extreme environments where they are relatively scarce or even non-existent in nature. Since such proteins are almost absent in the training datasets, it is uncertain whether AI model possesses the capability of evolving the protein to adapt extreme conditions. Antibodies are crucial components of affinity chromatography, and they are hoped to remain active at the extreme environments where most proteins cannot tolerate. In this study, we applied an advanced large language model (LLM), the Pro-PRIME model, to improve the alkali resistance of a representative antibody, a VHH antibody capable of binding to growth hormone. Through two rounds of design, we ensured that the selected mutant has enhanced functionality, including higher thermal stability, extreme pH resistance and stronger affinity, thereby validating the generalized capability of the LLM in meeting specific demands. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first LLM-designed protein product, which is successfully applied in mass production."
"Understanding how neural circuits drive behavior requires imaging methods that capture cellular dynamics in freely moving animals. Here, we introduce Wormspy, a compact, flexible, and cost-effective microscope system paired with an open-source software package, specifically designed for high-magnification epifluorescence imaging in Caenorhabditis elegans. By integrating dual-channel fluorescence optics, off-the-shelf components, and a motorized stage, Wormspy enables simultaneous recording of neuronal activity and behavioral dynamics without restraining the animal. Our system incorporates both manual and automated tracking--including DeepLabCut-based feature extraction--to maintain precise centering of the subject, even during complex locomotor behaviors. We demonstrate the utility of Wormspy across multiple paradigms: quantifying body wall muscle calcium transients during locomotion, capturing rapid sensory-evoked responses in the polymodal ASH neuron during aversive stimuli, and resolving food-related activity in the AWCON neuron. Notably, Wormspy further distinguishes subcellular calcium events in the RIA axonal compartments that correlate with head bending kinematics. This versatile platform not only reproduces known phenotypes, such as altered gait in gar-3 mutants, but also uncovers nuanced sensorimotor correlations previously inaccessible with conventional methods. Wormspys modular design and open-source framework lower the technical and financial barriers to high-resolution, behaviorally relevant neural imaging. Our findings establish Wormspy as a robust tool for dissecting the neural underpinnings of behavior in freely moving organisms, with potential applications extending to other small model systems."
"Human agriculture has always raced against insect adaptation, requiring updated pest control methods and knowledge of evolutionary processes. Excessive exposure to blue light (BL) kills a wide range of insect species and has attracted attention as an alternative to chemical pesticides. Here, to understand how insects adapt to BL toxicity, we investigated evolutionary responses to BL toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster over 70 generations using laboratory selection experiments. The selected line exhibited an obese phenotype accompanied by midgut elongation, with BL tolerance dependent on gut microbiota- mediated lipid accumulation. Whole-genome and transcriptome analyses consistently highlighted interactions between the microbiota and host lipid metabolism-related genes. Remarkably, manipulating genes associated with lipid accumulation conferred BL tolerance even in the absence of selection. We suggest that the acquisition of BL tolerance occurs through adaptive obesity. Our study introduces a mechanism of evolutionary adaptation of insects against BL-based selective pressure by maximising the benefits from the gut microbiota via midgut elongation.

"Intrabodies are engineered antibodies that function inside living cells, enabling therapeutic, diagnostic, and imaging applications. While powerful, their development has been hindered by challenges associated with their folding, solubility, and stability in the reduced intracellular environment. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline integrating AlphaFold2, ProteinMPNN, and live-cell screening to optimize antibody framework regions while preserving epitope-binding complementarity-determining regions. Using this approach, we successfully converted 19 out of 26 antibody sequences into functional single-chain variable fragment (scFv) intrabodies, including a panel targeting diverse histone modifications for real-time imaging of chromatin dynamics and gene regulation. Notably, 18 of these 19 sequences had failed to convert using the standard approach, demonstrating the unique effectiveness of our method. As antibody sequence databases expand, our method will accelerate intrabody design, making their development easier, more cost-effective, and broadly accessible for biological research."
"Several fluorescent proteins, when expressed in E. coli, are sensitive to weak magnetic fields1. We found that mScarlet3 fluorescence in E. coli reversibly decreased by 21% in the presence of a 60 mT magnetic field, the largest magnetic field effect (MFE) reported in any fluorescent protein. Purified mScarlet3 did not show an MFE, but addition of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and simultaneous illumination with blue and yellow light restored the MFE. Through extensive photophysical experiments, we developed a quantitative model of the giant MFE in mScarlet3-FMN mixtures. The key reaction step involved electron transfer from fully reduced FMNH2 to triplet-state mScarlet3, to form a triplet spin-correlated radical pair. The magnetic field then controlled the branching ratio between singlet recombination vs. triplet separation. Our quantitative model of the mScarlet3-FMN photocycle provides a framework for design and optimization of magnetic field-sensitive proteins, opening possibilities in fluorescent protein-based magnetometry, magnetic imaging, and magnetogenetic control."
"NOTCH2NL (NOTCH2-N-terminus-like) genes arose from incomplete, recent chromosome 1 segmental duplications implicated in human brain cortical expansion. Genetic characterization of these loci and their regulation is complicated by the fact they are embedded in large, nearly identical duplications that predispose to recurrent microdeletion syndromes. Using nearly complete long-read assemblies generated from 67 human and 12 ape haploid genomes, we show independent recurrent duplication among apes with functional copies emerging in humans [~]2.1 million years ago. We distinguish NOTCH2NL paralogs present in every human haplotype (NOTCH2NLA) from copy number variable ones. We also characterize large-scale structural variation, including gene conversion, for 28% of haplotypes leading to a previously undescribed paralog, NOTCH2tv. Finally, we apply Fiber-seq and long-read transcript sequencing to human cortical neurospheres to characterize the regulatory landscape and find that the most fixed paralogs, NOTCH2 and NOTCH2NLA, harbor the greatest number of paralog-specific elements potentially driving their regulation."
"BackgroundThe anthracycline doxorubicin (Dox) is a widely used genotoxic chemotherapeutic drug with known dose-limiting cardiotoxic effects. How Dox-induced damage either to cardiomyocytes or to cardiac stem cells, which may compromise cardiac regeneration, contributes to cardiotoxicity remains poorly understood.

MethodsHere we used a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based model system to determine the sensitivity of stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs) applying different treatment regimens of Dox. Next to a broad range of methods to determine cellular and mitochondrial functions we performed an in-depth whole genome transcriptome profiling in iPSCs as well as iCMs.

ResultsAs compared to their differentiated counterparts, iPSCs are highly sensitive against even short pulse-treatments with low Dox concentrations. Using such rather mild treatment conditions, we observed major mitochondrial impairments as demonstrated by increased mitochondrial fragmentation, persistent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced ATP levels, while neither a markedly increased nuclear DNA damage response nor apoptosis were detected. Albeit mitochondrial dysfunction was not accompanied by changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure or altered OXPHOS complex assembly, mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) organization was altered. This points to a possible role of mtDNA remodelling for contributing to the high susceptibility of iPSCs to Dox. Whole genome transcriptome profiling revealed major differences in the transcriptional response to Dox treatment between iPSCs and iCMs. We could show that a moderate and transient exposure of iPSCs to Dox is sufficient to cause major transcriptional changes as for example reflected by the downregulation of numerous pivotal genes regulating cellular homeostasis and energy metabolism in iPSCs. Furthermore, pulse-treatment with Dox at the iPSC stage, termed preconditioning here, shifts the global transcriptional landscape of iCMs towards the expression of genes associated with impaired cardiac muscle regeneration, disrupted energy metabolism, altered muscle contraction, and increased fibrosis.

ConclusionsOur findings support the hypothesis that Dox-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and transcriptional preconditioning in stem cells results in an impaired regenerative capacity after differentiation. This highlights a potential critical role of stem cells in mediating Dox-induced cardiotoxicity."
"As with most enzyme-storage disorders, DNA testing at an early age is critical for identifying genetic variants and their impact on disease burden. Still, most variants in genes such as Iduronate-2-sulfatase, IDS, are Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS). In patients presenting with Hunter Syndrome, clinical testing for IDS enzyme activity has been the mainstay to determine whether a variant is likely damaging. However, these enzyme assays are unable to predict disease severity or neuronal toxicity and may be missing many aspects of IDS pathology. In this study, we have developed an image-based assay using genome-engineered cells with IDS mutations to identify if a specific mutation causes lysosomal and membrane disruptions that characterize the disease. Specifically, we generate twelve mutant cell lines and document both the biochemical changes in IDS activity and the reproducible phenotypic differences therein. Next, we examine two patient-derived cell lines and find the same phenotypic differences in these lines compared to parental controls. The phenotypic changes are measured on a specific scale, which we term the PathScoreLC. To determine whether the observed changes are specific to IDS, we reintroduce a recombinant version of the IDS enzyme (rhIDS) to rescue both the biochemical and phenotypic changes of these cells. Interestingly, even after 120 hours, rescue is present, but not all the cells return to normal, which may also reflect the pathological state. Finally, we examine the gene expression differences and find that recombinant enzyme is not sufficient to induce transcriptional changes in the mutant lines at the time points studied. Overall, these cell-based lysosomal and membrane phenotypes may be key to quickly and accurately profiling clinical variants in the IDS gene."
"Our understanding of the skin microbiome has dramatically improved since the pioneering studies and the improvements in sequencing technologies. Species of the genus Corynebacterium are known to form a major part of the human skin microbiome but most detailed studies have focussed on other similarly prevalent genera like Staphylococcus and Cutibacteria. Prior to this study, there were few complete genomes for skin commensals of the genus Corynebacterium, with only 9 complete genomes available for the most commonly identified species C. tuberculostearicum. In this study we explored the genus Corynebacterium from a single body site by swabbing the axilla/underarm of 4 individuals and using a selective media to enrich for corynebacteria. We then generated whole genome sequencing data of these corynebacteria enriched isolates using long-read sequencing and subsequent bioinformatics analysis to reveal an unparalleled diversity of this genus from a single skin site. Through this approach, we obtained the closed genomes of 215 isolates, 154 derived from a single individual. With this genetic information, we were able to identify 7 different species including species previously not associated to the skin and two novel species provisionally named C. axilliensis and C. jamesii. We used pangenome analysis on 30 genetically distinct isolates spanning the 7 species to identify putative metabolic differences, antimicrobial resistance profiles, novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), prophages and phage defence systems. Our culture-based Nanopore sequencing approach has dramatically improved our overall knowledge of skin corynebacteria, and uniquely here also providing in-depth analysis from a single skin site, revealing a multitude of differences between the isolates. Here we not only improved our knowledge of axillary corynebacteria but also greatly expanded the publicly available number of cutaneous corynebacterial genomes complementing recent studies seeking to understand the diversity of skin corynebacteria."
"Microtissues (such as organoids or spheroids) are useful to model healthy or diseased human tissues and organs, with application in drug testing, tissue engineering, and personalized medicine. To characterize their morphology and phenotype, microtissues are often monitored using histology and high-resolution imaging. While this technique is well-established and standard for macroscopic tissue sections, it remains challenging to execute and has low throughput in the context of these sub-millimeter structures, mainly due to the fact that their size makes them difficult to locate within the embedding medium. To enhance the efficiency of microtissue histology, we developed an acoustofluidic device that arranges microtissues in a coplanar arrangement within HistoGel, a widely used embedding medium. Pre-patterning microtissues within HistoGel streamlines downstream processing by positioning the centers of mass of the microtissues at a pre-defined plan in the sample, simplifying sectioning, labeling, and imaging. We validated the method using differently sized HepG2 microtissues and tumor microtissues from osteosarcoma cells (Saos-2, MG-63, HOS), demonstrating that this method can be applied to different microtissue shapes, sizes, and types, without modifying established post-processing techniques. Our approach substantially enhances the microtissue histology workflow and broadens possibilities for microtissue analysis."
"Sequence-to-function models have broad applications in interpreting the molecular impact of genetic variation, yet have been criticized for poor performance in this task. Here we show that training models on functional genomic data with matched personal genomes improves their performance at variant effect prediction. Variant effect representations are retained even when fine tuning models to unseen cellular contexts and experimental readouts. Our results have implications for interpreting trait-associated genetic variation."
"High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death among women. Many cases arise from the Fallopian tubal epithelium (TE), exhibit numerous mutations, and present heterogenous pathological features. However, the contribution of specific mutation combinations to cellular transformation, pathological phenotype and chemotherapeutic response remains poorly understood. Here, we used a Trp53-deficient mouse TE-derived organoid platform to perform combinatorial CRISPR mutagenesis of 20 candidate HGSC driver genes. Mutations in Nf1, Cdkn2a and Map2k4 were most frequently observed in transformed organoids. Upon transplantation into mice, those containing Map2k4 mutations predominantly gave rise to papillary-glandular histology, whereas those containing Nf1 mutations formed more mesenchymal-like carcinomas. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Nf1-mutant tumors of all pathological phenotypes overexpressed the long non-coding RNA Pvt1, a marker associated with poor prognosis in HGSC patients. Map2k4-mutant organoids were more sensitive to paclitaxel and niraparib, while Nf1-mutant combinations responded better to trametinib. Notably, the removal of Rho kinase inhibitor (ROCKi) reduced trametinib sensitivity in both Map2k4- and Nf1-mutant organoids, underscoring the importance of culture conditions and potential antagonistic drug interactions in organoid-based drug screens. Collectively, our results demonstrate that TE-derived organoids coupled with combinatorial CRISPR mutagenesis provide a powerful system to unravel the genetic and phenotypic complexity of HGSC. In particular, we found that Map2k4 functions as a tumor suppressor that shapes distinct tumor histology and chemosensitivity, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic target in select HGSC cases."
"Environmental temperature influences the physiology and the behaviour of ectothermic organisms, including ants. However, the complex collective behaviour exhibited by ant colonies means that it is difficult to predict how the effects of temperature translate to colony-level functioning and features, such as the form of their nests. This study aims to determine the effects of environmental temperature on nest excavation rate and on the morphology of excavated nests. To this end, we characterized the nest digging activity of the yellow meadow ant Lasius flavus confined to dig in a nearly two-dimensional experimental setup maintained at a constant temperature ranging from 15 to 30 degrees Celsius. Ants dug faster at higher temperature, with an increase of digging rate that reflected the temperature-induced increase of movement speed of individual ants. Nevertheless, the shape of excavated nests remained statistically unchanged across the full range of temperatures we tested. These results suggest a mechanism whereby temperature accelerates in a similar way all the activities involved in the nest excavation process, rather than disproportionately affecting individual components of the process, such as tunnel branching or elongation. The ability to produce a consistent overall nest structure, irrespective of the temperature conditions encountered at the time of digging, may provide adaptive benefits to the colony.

SignificanceWhen temperature increases, ants move faster and their metabolism accelerates. Are the nests that they excavate also different? This question is not easy to answer beforehand because the complex collective regulations within an ant colony could either amplify or mitigate the effects of temperature on individual ant behaviour.

In our research, we found that the yellow meadow ants, Lasius flavus, dug significantly faster at higher temperature, but the shape of the nests that they excavated did not change. It is as if temperature sped up in a similar way all the activities involved in the excavation process, similar to the effect of increasing the playback speed of a video. Given the importance of nests for ant colonies, there might be a benefit in producing nests with stable characteristics, irrespective of the temperature experienced when the excavation took place."
"Campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis globally, presenting with either watery or bloody/inflammatory diarrhea. Despite this clinical variability, the underlying mechanisms driving these distinct diarrheal manifestations remain unclear. The neonatal piglet model provides a unique opportunity to investigate these differences using strains with defined disease manifestations. We evaluated ten C. jejuni strains previously shown to cause consistent diarrheal manifestations in neonatal piglets: five strains associated with watery diarrhea and five associated with bloody/inflammatory diarrhea. The study found significant strain to strain variation among most assays, but overall strains associated with bloody/inflammatory diarrhea exhibited significantly higher levels of epithelial cell invasion, intracellular survival, macrophage survivability, and disruption of intestinal barrier integrity compared to watery diarrhea strains. Notably, both groups had similar levels of adherence, produced similar levels of cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) and elicited comparable IL-8 responses. While both groups facilitated translocation of commensal E. coli, only bloody/inflammatory strains caused increased paracellular permeability, as shown by TEER and FITC-dextran assays. This study reveals that there is significant variation in the virulence phenotype of C. jejuni strains and identifies several characteristics consistently associated with a specific diarrheal manifestation group. These findings provide new insights into the strain-specific pathogenic mechanisms of C. jejuni, with implications for understanding host-pathogen interactions and informing targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

Author SummaryCampylobacter jejuni is one of the most common bacterial causes of diarrhea worldwide, affecting millions each year. Infected individuals may experience either watery or bloody/inflammatory diarrhea, but the reasons why different strains cause different types of illness have remained a mystery. In this study, we used a neonatal piglet model, which accurately mimics human diarrheal disease, to investigate why certain C. jejuni strains cause more severe symptoms than others. We compared strains known to cause either watery or bloody diarrhea and found key differences in their ability to invade intestinal cells, survive inside immune cells, and damage the intestinal barrier. While both groups of strains could trigger inflammation and translocate E. coli through the intestinal lining, only the strains linked to bloody diarrhea caused significant barrier disruption and had increased intracellular survival. These findings reveal that different C. jejuni strains follow distinct paths during infection, which helps explain why they produce different symptoms. Unraveling these differences improves our overall understanding of Campylobacter pathogenesis that could lead to improved diagnostics and/or treatments to reduce the burden of campylobacteriosis around the world."
"Fungal cyclotetrapeptide nectriatide and its synthetic linear derivatives (nectriatide-based compounds, NCTs), having no antifungal activity, potentiated antifungal activity of amphotericin B (AmB) against Candida albicans. The mechanism of action was investigated using fluorescein-conjugated and biotin-tagged probes. Microscopy revealed fluorescent-probe localization at the C. albicans cell membrane. The biotinyl probe binding assay towards membrane lipids showed the highest affinity for ergosterol but no affinity for cholesterol. Ergosterol binding was confirmed by a liposome disruption assay. LC-MS quantification of AmB in C. albicans revealed that NCTs increased AmB binding to C. albicans. These results indicate that NCTs bind to ergosterol on the fungal plasma membrane, subsequently localizing AmB, explaining the observed potentiation of AmB fungicidal activity."
"Major mental disorders are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development. Large and heterogeneous samples are required to define generalizable links between brain development and psychopathology. To this end, we introduce the Reproducible Brain Charts (RBC), an open data resource that integrates data from 5 large studies of brain development in youth from three continents (N=6,346; 45% Female). Confirmatory bifactor models were used to create harmonized psychiatric phenotypes that capture major dimensions of psychopathology. Following rigorous quality assurance, neuroimaging data were carefully curated and processed using consistent pipelines in a reproducible manner with DataLad, the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC), and FreeSurfer. Initial analyses of RBC data emphasize the benefit of careful quality assurance and data harmonization in delineating developmental effects and associations with psychopathology. Critically, all RBC data - including harmonized psychiatric phenotypes, unprocessed images, and fully processed imaging derivatives - are openly shared without a data use agreement via the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative. Together, RBC facilitates large-scale, reproducible, and generalizable research in developmental and psychiatric neuroscience."
"The study of cortical geometry and connectivity is prevalent in research on the human brain. However, these two aspects of brain structure are usually examined separately, leaving the essential connections between the brains folding patterns and white matter connectivity unexplored. In this study, we aimed to elucidate fundamental links between cortical geometry and white matter tract connectivity. We developed the concept of tract-geometry coupling (TGC) by optimizing the alignment between tract connectivity to the cortex and multiscale cortical geometry. Specifically, spectral analyses of the cortical surface yielded a set of geometrical eigenmodes, which were then used to explain the locations on the cortical surface reached by specific white matter tracts, referred to as tract reachability. In two independent datasets, we confirmed that tract reachability was well characterized by cortical geometry. We further observed that TGC had high test-retest ability and was specific to each individual. Interestingly, low-frequency TGC was found to be heritable and more informative than the high-frequency components in behavior prediction. Finally, we found that TGC could reproduce task-evoked cortical activation patterns. Collectively, our study provides a new approach to mapping coupling between cortical geometry and connectivity, highlighting how these two aspects jointly shape the connected brain."
"Identifying phase coupling recorded from multiple electrodes during electrophysiological diagnostics, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticography (ECoG), helps neuroscientists and clinicians understand the underlying brain structures or mechanisms. From a statistical perspective, these signals are multi-dimensional circular measurements that are correlated with one another and can be effectively modeled using a torus graph model designed for circular random variables. Using the torus graph model avoids the issue of detecting pseudo correlations. However, the naive estimation of this model tends to lead to a dense network structure, which is difficult to interpret. Therefore, to enhance the interpretability of the brain network structure, we propose to induce a sparse solution by implementing a regularized score matching estimation for the torus graph model based on the information criteria. In numerical simulations, our method successfully recovered the true dependence structure of the brain, from a synthetic dataset sampled from a pre-given torus graph model distribution. Furthermore, we present analyses of two real datasets, one involving human EEG and the other marmoset ECoG, demonstrating that our method can be widely applied to phase-coupling analysis across different types of neural data. Using our proposed method, the modularity of the estimated network structure revealed more resolved brain structures and demonstrated differences in trends among individuals.

Author summaryCurrent EEG and ECoG analyses are limited because relatively simplistic statistical methods, such as linear correlation or coherence measures, are often used, which fail to capture the full complexity of phase relationships. In this study we attempted to use a superior data analysis technique to capture the multidimensional dependence structure in brain that can impede clinical interpretations from participant data. Specifically, we utilized a modified torus graph model based on directional statistics. With this approach, certain brain structures could be resolved into a sparse graphical network with fewer edges, implying modular and small-world characteristics."
"Flavivirus infections by Dengue and Zika virus impose a significant healthcare threat worldwide. At present no FDA-approved specific antiviral treatment is available, and the safety of a vaccine against Dengue virus is still under debate. Here, we report the identification of the CADA derivative flavitransin (FT), with potent activity against DENV serotype 2 in various cell types. Moreover, FT showed consistent anti-flaviviral activity against all four DENV serotypes, and also against Zika and Yellow fever virus. Viral polyprotein biogenesis was completely abolished by FT treatment of DENV-infected cells. Drug profiling by a-time-of-drug-addition assay revealed a post-entry antiviral effect of FT, in line with its anticipated Sec61 inhibitory effect. Subsequent analysis of the individual viral proteins in transfected HEK293T cells indicated that FT suppresses the expression of the structural proteins (pre-membrane and envelope) only. Furthermore, cell free in vitro protein translation analysis demonstrated a direct inhibitory effect of FT on the co-translational translocation of the DENV polyprotein across the ER membrane. More specifically, FT inhibited the initiation of protein translocation into the ER that relies on the N-terminal transmembrane region of the capsid subunit of the DENV polyprotein, resulting in rerouting of the viral pre-protein to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation. Finally, selection and genotyping of FT-resistant HCT116 cells revealed a unique A70V mutation in the Sec61 subunit that conferred resistance to FT in infected cells. Long-term exposure of DENV to FT demonstrated a high barrier to resistance development. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that FT selectively interferes with the initiation of ER co-translational translocation of the DENV polyprotein and confirm the critical role of this translocation process in the flavivirus replication cycle."
"Terrestrial environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques have been proposed as a means of sensitive, non-lethal pollinator monitoring. To date, however, no studies have provided evidence that eDNA methods can achieve detection densities on par with traditional pollinator surveys. Using a large-scale dataset of eDNA and corresponding net surveys, we show that eDNA methods enable sensitive, species-level characterization of whole bumble bee communities, including rare and critically endangered species such as the rusty pathed bumble bee (RPBB; Bombus affinis). All species present in netting surveys were detected within eDNA surveys, apart from two rare species in the socially parasitic subgenus Psithyrus (cuckoo bumble bees). Further, for rare non-parasitic species, eDNA methods exhibited similar sensitivity relative to traditional netting. Relative to flower eDNA samples, sequenced field negative controls resulted in significantly lower rates of Bombus detection, and these detections were likely attributable to high rates of background eDNA on environmental surfaces. Lastly, we found that eDNA-based frequency of detection across replicate surveys was strongly associated with net-based measures of abundance across site visits. We conclude that the method is cost-effective and highly scalable for semi-quantitative characterization of at-risk bumble bee communities, providing a new approach for improving our understanding of species habitat associations."
"1Minor genetic changes have produced profound differences in cognitive abilities between humans and our closest relatives, particularly in language. Despite decades of research, ranging from single-gene studies to broader evolutionary analyses[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], key questions about the genomic foundations of human language have persisted, including which sequences are involved, how they evolved, and whether similar changes occur in other vocal learning species. Here we provide the first evidence directly linking rapidly evolved genomic regions to language abilities in contemporary humans. Through extensive analysis of 65 million years of evolutionary events in over 30,000 individuals, we demonstrate that Human Ancestor Quickly Evolved Regions (HAQERs)[5] - sequences that rapidly accumulated mutations after the human-chimpanzee split - specifically influence language but not general cognition. These regions evolved to shape language development by altering binding of Forkhead domain transcription factors, including FOXP2. Strikingly, language-associated HAQER variants show higher prevalence in Neanderthals than modern humans, have been stable throughout recent human history, and show evidence of convergent evolution across other mammalian vocal learners. An unexpected pattern of balancing selection acting on these apparently beneficial alleles is explained by their pleiotropic effects on prenatal brain development contributing to birth complications, reflecting an evolutionary trade-off between language capability and reproductive fitness. By developing the Evolution Stratified-Polygenic Score analysis, we show that language capabilities likely emerged before the human-Neanderthal split - far earlier than previously thought[3, 6, 7]. Our findings establish the first direct link between ancient genomic divergence and present-day variation in language abilities, while revealing how evolutionary constraints continue to shape human cognitive development."
"Signaling pathways transmit and process information, enabling cells to respond accurately to external cues. Disease states like cancer can corrupt signal transmission, though the magnitude to which they reduce information capacity has not been quantified. Here we apply pseudo-random pulsatile optogenetic stimulation, live-cell imaging, and information theory to compare the information capacity of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways in EML4-ALK-driven lung cancer cells (STE-1) and non-transformed lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). The information rate through the RTK/ERK pathway in STE-1 cells was below 0.5 bit/hour but increased to 3 bit/hour after oncogene inhibition. Information was transmitted by only 50-70% of cells, whose channel capacity (maximum information rate) was estimated through in silico protocol optimization. Although oncogene inhibition increased the capacity of the RTK/ERK pathway in STE-1 cells (6 bit/hour), capacity remained lower than in BEAS-2B (11 bit/hour). The capacity of the parallel RTK/calcineurin pathway in BEAS-2B exceeded 15 bit/hour. This study highlights information capacity as a sensitive metric for identifying disease-associated dysfunction and evaluating effects of targeted interventions."
"Trichomonasvirus (TVV) is a double-stranded RNA virus from the Pseudototiviridae family that exclusively infects Trichomonas vaginalis, the protozoan responsible for the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection. Within the Trichomonasvirus genus, five distinct viral species have been identified, and intriguingly, a single T. vaginalis isolate can simultaneously harbor multiple TVV species. Previous studies have explored the impact of TVV infection on the physiology and virulence of T. vaginalis, yet findings remain inconsistent and often contradictory. We propose that these discrepancies stem from the heterogeneous intracellular distribution of TVV within individual cells of the same T. vaginalis isolate. To investigate this, we employed ultra-deep single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence assays to examine multiple T. vaginalis isolates. Our results revealed striking variability in the proportion of infected cells carrying the same viral species, even within a single isolate. The present study is the first to demonstrate the dynamic and non-uniform intracellular distribution of TVV at the single-cell level. These findings challenge previous assumptions and provide a new perspective on the intricate virus-host interactions between TVV and T. vaginalis, offering new avenues for further research into their complex relationship.

Author SummaryTrichomonas vaginalis is a parasitic protozoan responsible for the most prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted infection worldwide. In 1985, researchers discovered a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus within T. vaginalis, which was later named Trichomonasvirus (TVV). This virus is believed to influence the hosts gene expression, impacting cytoadherence, drug susceptibility, and virulence proteins. However, studies on TVV-host interaction have produced conflicting results, with some genes appearing upregulated in one experiment but downregulated in another or vice versa. We hypothesize that these inconsistencies stem from the non-uniform distribution of TVV among individual cells within the same T. vaginalis isolate. Based on the experimental data from ultra-deep single-cell sequencing and immuno-localization, our study reveals that TVVs intracellular distribution is highly heterogeneous and dynamic. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that TVV is uniformly and statically distributed. This heterogeneity underscores the need to reassess previous research on TVV-T. vaginalis interactions, as earlier studies may have overlooked this crucial factor."
"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease in humans associated with severe complications with a significant impact on the health, life expectancy, and lifestyle of patients.

The present study has been designed to examine the anti-hyperglycemic efficacy of two medicinal plants - Nigella sativa seeds and Cichorium intybus leaves - and their combined effects on body weight and hematological/serological parameters in alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits.

For this purpose, 30 adult rabbits were divided into six equal groups of five rabbits each. Group I was kept as the negative control, while all other groups received a single intravenous injection of alloxan monohydrate to induce diabetes: Group II as positive control; Group III received metformin hydrochloride; Group IV was fed powdered C. intybus plant leaves; Group V was given N. sativa aqueous seeds extract; and Group VI was fed a combination of C. intybus and N. sativa. Fasting blood glucose levels and body weight of rabbits were observed at 0 days (before treatment) to Day 28 and regularly monitored during the four-week experimental trial. Biochemical analysis, serum insulin level, and hematological parameters were measured at the end of the experiment.

Results showed that C. intybus, N. sativa, and their mixture significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the blood glucose levels, urea and creatinine levels, and enzyme levels in the blood. At the same time, body weight gain, red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count, and packed cell volume (PCV) % were increased in diabetic rabbits as compared with positive control rabbits. It was concluded that these plants have potential hypoglycemic effects and reduced diabetic complications in alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits. Further studies are needed to understand their potential for antidiabetic remedy."
"Neural stimulation, such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), are highly effective clinical interventions for a broad spectrum of psychiatric disorders, including depression and schizophrenia. However, their mechanism of action at the cellular level remains poorly understood. Here, we modelled ECT with repeated optogenetic neuronal stimulation in the mouse dentate gyrus, and observed ECT-like behavioral effects, including decreased depression-like behavior and increased locomotor activity. At the cellular level, we found dematuration to a long-term stable state, persisting for more than one month, defined by changes in nuclear structure, gene expression patterns resembling the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and altered neural coding of navigational information. Moreover, knockout of the G2/M master regulator Cyclin B rescued some of behavioral and cellular effects. These findings demonstrate that ECT-like brain stimulation triggers plasticity of the cellular state, revealing a form of stimulus-regulated nuclear reprogramming with potential clinical utility."
"Impermeant molecules inside a cell would lead to an inward osmotic flow of water, causing swelling, were it not for the pumping of permeant sodium ions out of the cell as soon as they leak in. The energy barrier model for a semipermeable membrane, first introduced by Debye to provide a molecular-level explanation of the vant Hoff equation for osmotic pressure, can be used to advantage in this situation, since the pump can be conceptualized as increasing the energy barrier for the sodium ion. The Debye model has previously been extended to include osmosis induced by electrostatically neutral solutes. Discussion of the effect of ion pumping on water transport requires an understanding of osmosis in systems containing permeant ions, that is, Donnan systems. We have obtained an equation for Donnan osmosis across a Debye energy barrier that separates an aqueous solution of permeant sodium, potassium, and chloride ions from a solution containing these permeant ions and additionally an impermeant anion, the latter representing intra-cellular impermeant charged species. Donnan osmosis occurs even if osmolarities on the two sides of the membrane are equal. Numerical representation shows that the Donnan-Debye model provides a quantitative theoretical framework for the action of the sodium/potassium/ATPase ion pump as effectively rendering the extracellular sodium ions impermeant, thus balancing the impermeant molecules inside the cell. Another application of Donnan osmosis shows that ion charge effects, missing from lists of Starling forces, are nonetheless expected to be a major contributor to transport across capillary walls.

SummaryOsmosis as driven by Starling forces is applicable only if the solute is electrostatically neutral. For ions, Donnan charge effects dominate. An equation for Donnan osmosis is presented and applied to ion pumps and to transport across capillary walls."
"BackgroundATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes of the imitation switch (ISWI) family slide and space nucleosomes. The ISWI ATPase subunit forms obligate complexes with accessory subunits whose mechanistic roles remain poorly understood. In bakers yeast, the Isw2 ATPase subunit associates with Itc1, the orthologue of human ACF1/BAZ1A. Prior data suggested that the genomic deletion of the 374 N-terminal amino acids from Itc1 (hereafter called itc1{Delta}N) leads to a gain-of-toxic-function phenotype with severe growth defects in the BY4741 genetic background, possibly due to defective nucleosome spacing activity of the mutant complex.

ResultsHere we show that the deletion encompasses a novel motif termed downWAC that forms a conserved structural module with the N-terminal WAC domain. The module is predicted to interact with DNA. However, it does not form a stable interaction interface with the remainder of the complex. Instead, it is connected through a long disordered polypeptide linker to the remainder of the complex. Curiously, the itc1{Delta}N allele does not lead to measurable growth defects in haploid BY4741 and diploid BY4743 strains. It also does not alter genome-wide nucleosome organization in wild-type cells. To rule out that potentially redundant remodeling factors obscure itc1{Delta}N-associated phenotypes, we repeated experiments in cells devoid of ISW1 and CHD1 remodelers with the same results. Only at known target genes of the ISW2 complex was the nucleosome organization perturbed in itc1{Delta}N cells.

ConclusionsWe conclude that the deletion of Itc1 N-terminus is indistinguishable from the full deletion of either ITC1 or ISW2. As such, itc1{Delta}N should be considered a null allele of ISW2. We propose a model, in which the WAC-downWAC module, along with a flexible protein linker, helps ISW2 in searching for its target genes and positioning +1-nucleosomes."
"Bacteria often rapidly evolve resistance to bacteriophages (phages) by mutating or suppressing the phage-receptors, the factors that phages first target to initiate infection. Flagellotropic phages infect bacteria by initially binding to the flagellum. Since motility is an important fitness factor that allows bacteria to efficiently explore their environment, losing flagellar function to evade infection by flagellotropic phages represents a crucial trade-off. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary responses of Escherichia coli when exposed to the flagellotropic phage {chi}. Using an experimental evolution approach, E. coli cells were repeatedly subjected to environments rich in phage {chi} but selective for motility. Unlike traditional well-mixed cultures, we employed swim-plate assays to simulate spatial confinement and promote motility. Whole genome sequencing of evolved populations revealed early emergence of non-motile, {chi}-resistant mutants with mutations disrupting motility-related genes. Motile mutants emerged in later passages, possessing mutations in the flagellin gene fliC. Swim-plate assays showed a diverse range of motility among these mutants, with some displaying slower, and others faster, expansion speeds compared to the ancestral strain. Single-cell tracking experiments indicated an increased tumble bias in {chi}-resistant mutants, suggesting an adaptive response involving altered flagellar rotation. Our findings demonstrate that motility can undergo trade-offs and trade-ups with phage resistance, shedding light on the complex evolutionary dynamics between motile bacteria and flagellotropic phages."
"Anatomical asymmetry is a hallmark of the human brain and may reflect hemispheric differences in its functional organization. Widely used software like FreeSurfer can automate neuroanatomical measurements and facilitate studies of hemispheric asymmetry. However, patterns of surface area lateralization measured using FreeSurfer are curiously consistent across diverse samples. Here, we demonstrate systematic biases in these measurements obtained from the default processing pipeline. We compared surface area asymmetry measured from reconstructions of original brains vs. the same scans after flipping their left-right orientation. The default pipeline returned implausible asymmetry patterns between the original and flipped brains: Many structures were always left- or right-lateralized. Notably, these biases occur prominently in key speech and language regions. In contrast, manual labeling and curvature-based parcellations of key structures both yielded the expected reversals of left/right lateralization in flipped brains. We determined that these biases result from discrepancies in how regional labels are defined in the left vs. right hemisphere in the default cortical parcellation atlases. These biases are carried into individual parcellations because the FreeSurfer parcellation algorithm prioritizes vertex correspondence to the template atlas relative to individual neuroanatomical variation. We further demonstrate several straightforward, bias-free approaches to measuring surface area asymmetry, including using symmetric registration templates and parcellation atlases, vertex-wise analyses, and within-subject curvature-based parcellations. These results highlight theoretical concerns about using only the default processing stream to make inferences about population-level brain asymmetry and underscore the need for validating bias-free neuroanatomical measurements, particularly when studying regions where structural lateralization may underlie functional lateralization."
"The genome of the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) is presented in 10 chromosomal pseudomolecules along with 132 unplaced scaffolds for a combined length of 216.56 Mb. The genome is highly contiguous, with a benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCO) completion score of 98.25%, an N50 of 20.54 Mb, and the longest scaffold 37.41 Mb in length. On the basis of chromosomal synteny with other aphid genomes, the hemlock woolly adelgids genome is composed of 8 autosomes and two sex (X) chromosomes. Annotation of the assembly identified 11,800 coding genes, 1,930 non-coding genes, and 20,403 mRNA transcripts.

"BackgroundsSeveral correlational or group comparison evidence highlighted robust associations between sleep health and macro-scale brain organization. However, inter-individual variability is critical in such interplay. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the role of brain imaging features in predicting diverse sleep health-related characteristics at the individual subject level using the Machine Learning (ML) approach.

MethodsA sample of 28,088 participants from the UK Biobank was employed to calculate 4677 structural and functional neuroimaging markers. Then, we employed them to predict self-reported insomnia symptoms, sleep duration, easiness of getting up in the morning, chronotype, daily nap, daytime sleepiness, and snoring. To assess the predictability of brain features, we built seven different linear and nonlinear ML models for each sleep health-related characteristic.

ResultsWe performed extensive ML analyses that involved more than 19 years of compute time. We observed relatively low performance in predicting all sleep health-related characteristics from brain images (e.g., balanced accuracy ranging between 0.50-0.59). Across all models, the best performance achieved was 0.59, using a linear ML model to predict the ease of getting up in the morning. In fact, a similar performance was achieved with models trained solely on age and sex, indicating that these demographic factors might be the ones driving the predictions.

ConclusionsThe low capability of multimodal neuroimaging markers in predicting sleep health-related characteristics, even under extensive ML optimization in a large population sample, suggests a complex relationship between sleep health and brain organization."
"In Leishmania parasites, as for their hosts, the ubiquitin proteasome system is important for cell viability. As part of a systematic gene deletion study, it was discovered that four cysteine protease type deubiquitinases (DUBs) are essential for parasite survival in the promastigote stage, including DUB16. Here we have purified and characterised recombinant DUB16 from Leishmania donovani, which belongs to the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH) family. DUB16 efficiently hydrolyses C-terminal aminocoumarin and rhodamine conjugates of ubiquitin consistent with proposed cellular roles of UCH-type DUBs in regenerating free monomeric ubiquitin from small molecule ubiquitin adducts arising from adventitious metabolic processes. The crystal structure of DUB16 reveals a typical UCH-type deubiquitinase fold, and a relatively short and disordered crossover loop that appears to restrict access to the catalytic cysteine. At close to stoichiometric enzyme to substrate ratios, DUB16 exhibits deubiquitinase activity towards diubiquitins linked through isopeptide bonds between Lys11, Lys48 or Lys63 residues of the proximal ubiquitin and the C-terminus of the distal ubiquitin. With 100-1000-fold higher turnover rates, DUB16 cleaves the ubiquitin-ribosomal L40 fusion protein to give the mature products. A DUB-targeting cysteine-reactive cyanopyrrolidine compound, IMP-1710, inhibits DUB16 activity. IMP-1710 was shown in promastigote cell viability assays to have parasite killing activity with EC50 values of 1-2 M, comparable to the anti-leishmanial drug, miltefosine. L. mexicana parasites engineered to overproduce DUB16 showed a modest increase in resistance to IMP-1710, providing evidence that IMP-1710 inhibits DUB16 in vivo. Together these results suggest on-target activity and that DUB16 may be a druggable target to develop new anti-leishmania compounds."
"BackgroundToxoplasma gondii is an important pathogen and model organism for studying mechanisms of immune evasion and defense. Within the same strain, model organisms are typically assumed to be isogenic; for T. gondii, within-strain genetic divergence has been detected based on phenotypic changes and older molecular techniques but not characterized at the genomic level. We therefore used Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing to characterize three independently maintained T. gondii ME49 isolates: 2015T and 2020T (obtained from ATCC and propagated in cell culture), and 2000B (propagated in mice).

ResultsWe de novo assembled a new T. gondii ME49 reference genome and, using state of-the-art variant calling combined with pangenomic genotyping, detected variants between the sequenced isolates. Our new reference genome exceeded existing reference genomes in continuity (NG50 = 6.68 Mb versus 1.2 Mb in RefSeq) and structural accuracy, resolving all chromosomes except for a single break in the ribosomal DNA region. For isolates 2000B and 2020T, we identified 106 and 128 variants, respectively, across a final call set of 79 SNVs, 93 INDELs, and five structural variants; 18 small non-synonymous variants included genes associated with T. gondii life cycle (AP2X-8) and virulence in vivo (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase). A 13 kb expansion in the ROP8-ROP2A virulence locus increased the copy number of ROP2A-ROP8 genes in isolates 2000B and 2020T from three to six.

ConclusionsWe provide an improved T. gondii ME49 reference genome and demonstrate the potentially confounding effect of intra-strain genetic heterogeneity, highlighting the need for continuous genomic monitoring for long-term genetic identity."
"The explosion of next-generation sequencing technologies has allowed researchers to move from studying single genes to thousands of genes, and thereby to also consider the relationships within gene networks. Like others, we are interested in understanding how developmental and evolutionary forces shape the expression of individual genes, as well as the interactions among genes. In pursuing these questions, we confronted the central challenge that standard approaches fail to control the Type I error and/or have low power in the presence of high dimensionality (i.e., large number of genes) and small sample size, as in many gene expression studies. To overcome these challenges, we used random projection tests and correlation network comparisons to characterize differences in network connectivity and density. We detail central challenges, discuss sample size guidelines, and provide rigorous statistical approaches for exploring coexpression differences with small sample sizes. We apply these approaches in a species known for rapid adaptation - the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Our findings provide evidence for coexpression network differences at developmental and evolutionary timescales and suggest that flexibility in gene coexpression relationships could promote evolvability."
"Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) - a 243-residue amphipathic protein containing an N-terminal globular domain and a primarily helical C-terminal lipid binding domain - is a principal protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or ""good"" cholesterol, which is an important component of lipid homeostasis in humans. Synthesized in the liver and intestine and excreted in the blood, ApoA-I undergoes complex, cooperative, and dynamic self-assembly with membrane lipids producing unlipidated (or weakly lapidated), nascent discoidal, and mature HDL states. In vitro studies establish that the recombination of purified protein and lipids reconstitutes this cooperative self-assembly. However, the kinetic pathways by which these mesoscopic, proteolipidic assemblies form remain incompletely understood. Here, we monitor the dynamics of ApoA-I-membrane interactions through real-time monitoring of morphological changes, which ensue when ApoA-I is incubated with minimal giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) composed of single phospholipids or phase-separating phospholipid-cholesterol mixtures. Our fluorescence and atomic force microscopy measurements reveal that the interaction produces discoidal particles while remodeling the parent vesicle in discrete stages involving membrane poration, solute leakage, vesiculation, and lipid-lipid phase separation. We find that the qualitative phenomenology is robust and fully reproducible for different protein mutants and alleles (WT APOA-1, {Delta}49ApoA-I, ApoE-3, and ApoE-4) and different lipid mixtures (PC, PC+PS), we tested. Our molecular simulations recapitulate the essential shape changes and further reveal the composition dependence of the interactions. Together, these findings depict key steps in the protein-lipid interactions, which guide the assembly of mesoscopic reconstituted lipoproteins and nanodiscs."
"Precision oncology remains challenging due to gaps in understanding tumor biology and immunology, as well as the scarcity of consistent data across large cohorts. Here, we introduce MOSAIC (Multi-Omics Spatial Atlas in Cancer), a multi-center clinical Omics study designed to systematically profile thousands of cancer samples, with a focus on spatial and single-cell data across multiple tumor types. MOSAIC exploits recent technological advances to integrate spatial and single-cell data with complementary data modalities, including hematoxylin-eosin histology scans, bulk RNA and exome sequences, to generate comprehensive representations of cancer histology, genomics, and transcriptomics. MOSAIC also collects extensive and curated clinical information to ensure that patients meet the precise inclusion criteria for each cohort. The consortium aims to integrate all data modalities using artificial intelligence and other computational approaches in order to identify clinically-relevant biomarkers and cancer subtypes. This paper outlines the core objectives of MOSAIC, its potential impact, early proofs-of-concept, design, and experimental considerations. Additionally, we introduce the MOSAIC Window initiative, featuring the first released dataset from 60 patients, offering a glimpse into the projects groundbreaking potential. Using four selected patients, we demonstrate the power of multi-omic approaches to analyze and interpret intra-tumoral variability within and across patients, providing insights on specific drug sensitivity of cancer subpopulations and revealing potential impacts on therapeutic recommendations."
"Early life pain and stress have lasting consequences on nervous system development that can interact with later stress or trauma to create a susceptibility to fear, anxiety, depression and chronic pain among other psychological disorders. Recent work has identified changes in corticotropin releasing factor signaling in limbic system structures, such as the amygdala and hypothalamus, as a key mechanism behind these changes - albeit in a sex-dependent manner. CRF has two major receptors, CRHR1 and CRHR2 which have also been shown to play key roles in fear and pain expression. The current work examines the effects of early life pain designed to mimic the neonatal medical trauma that occurs in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), paired with a juvenile trauma in the form of fear conditioning, on expression of crhr1 and crhr2 mRNA in the central (CeA) and basolateral (BLA) amygdala as well as the paraventricular (PVN) and ventromedial (VMH) hypothalamus. While prior work has demonstrated that early life pain significantly impacts expression of the CRF ligand, the current data demonstrate that early life pain and fear conditioning largely fail to affect CRH receptor expression in the amygdala. Modest changes in expression to crhr2 in a sex and region-specific manner were observed in the hypothalamus."
"Predicting the efficacy and toxicity of intramuscular mRNA vaccines remains challenging. Here, we describe an ex vivo human cell-based model that replicates immune responses to lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based mRNA vaccines that require intramuscular injection. Vaccines are administered into a biomimetic muscle module containing human skeletal myoblasts and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to mimic intramuscular vaccination, followed by transfer of the APCs and soluble factors to a microfluidic human lymphoid follicle chip (LF Chip) to mimic lymphatic drainage. Non-replicating mRNA vaccines directly induce antigen expression in APCs, whereas self-amplifying mRNA vaccines require muscle cell-APC contact within the intramuscular vaccination module. Transfer of APCs and soluble factors to the LF Chip induces LF expansion, de novo antigen-specific IgG production against a naive antigen (rabies virus glycoprotein), and cytokine release, with responses varying depending on LNP type. Vaccination of LF chips against SARS- COV-2 Spike recall antigen using the Moderna Spikevax vaccine generates neutralizing antibodies and induces somatic hypermutation. This biomimetic platform offers an all-human alternative for evaluating vaccine-induced immunity, potentially obviating the need for non-human primates and accelerating vaccine development."
"Structural variation is increasingly recognized as a pivotal contributor to genomic diversity in marine invertebrates, yet its extent and evolutionary significance remain poorly characterized in many species. Haplotype-phased genome assembly is an excellent method for studying such variations by comparing homologous chromosomes. In this study, we constructed a haplotype-phased genome assembly for the western Pacific abalone, Haliotis gigantea, using high-fidelity (HiFi) long-read sequencing and high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data. The primary and alternative assemblies each comprised 18 long scaffolds (>50 Mb), consistent with the species diploid chromosome number (2n = 36), and contained 96.5% and 96.2% complete single-copy Metazoa Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs genes, respectively, indicating high assembly quality. Comparative analysis of the two haplotypes revealed three homologous chromosomes with large-scale non-syntenic regions caused by extensive segmental duplications, with each enriched in distinct gene domains. These non-syntenic chromosomes likely originated in abalone evolution, as they were conserved across both closely and distantly related species. Our findings highlight the evolutionary importance of non-syntenic structural variation in shaping genome architecture and suggest that such variation may play a broader role in functional diversification across abalones."
"The accelerating loss of coral reefs worldwide due to anthropogenic climate change has led to a myriad of studies aimed at understanding the basis of coral resilience to support reef conservation. Central to this effort is elucidating metabolic interactions between the cnidarian host and dinoflagellate algal symbionts, which has traditionally been challenging to do in hospite. Here, using data from four divergent coral species, we develop the first metaproteome model of thermal stress-based coral-algal dysbiosis. Our results demonstrate that thermal stress induces dampening of algal-symbiont metabolic pathways causing the host to shift its metabolism from symbiont maintenance to energy conservation. This putatively degrades symbiosome function, further degrading the symbiotic partnership. Although each coral host species we studied shows a distinct response to the stress regime, reflecting divergent evolutionary histories, symbiont dampening is consistently observed and comprises a major outcome of coral-algal dysbiosis. Our results also provide biomarkers for holobiont conservation.

TeaserCoral algal symbionts show reduced protein abundance under thermal stress, disrupting host biology and leading to coral bleaching."
"Recycling of cellular components through autophagy maintains homeostasis in dynamic nutrient environments, and its dysregulation is linked to several human disorders. Although extensive research has characterized the core mechanisms of autophagy, limited insight into its systems-wide dynamic control has hampered predictive modeling and effective in vivo manipulation. In this study, we mapped the genetic network that controls both the dynamic activation and inactivation of autophagy during nitrogen changes, using a combination of time-resolved high-content imaging, deep learning, and latent feature analysis. This approach generated a comprehensive genome-wide profiling repository, termed AutoDRY, categorizing 5919 mutants based on their nutrient response kinetics and differential contributions to autophagosome formation and clearance. Integrating these profiles with functional and genetic network data unveiled a hierarchical and multi-layered control of autophagy, identifying new regulatory aspects of the core machinery and established nutrient-sensing pathways. By leveraging multi-omics resources and explainable machine learning to predict genetic perturbation effects and infer new regulatory mechanisms, we identified the retrograde pathway as a pivotal, time-varying autophagy modulator through transcriptional tuning of core genes. By charting the systems-wide dynamical control of autophagy, we have laid the groundwork for connecting the complexity of genome-wide influences with specific core mechanisms. This represents a significant advancement in studying complex genetic phenotypes, guides functional genomics of dynamic cellular processes in any organism, and provides a powerful starting point for hypothesis-based research on autophagy."
"Cydalima perspectalis (the box tree moth), Leptoglossus occidentalis (the western conifer seed bug), and Tecia solanivora (the Guatemalan tuber moth) are three economically harmful invasive insect species. This study presents their genomic and transcriptomic sequences, generated through whole- genome sequencing, RNA-seq transcriptomic data, and Hi-C sequencing. The resulting genome assemblies exhibit good quality, providing valuable insights into these species. The genome sizes are 500.4 Mb for C. perspectalis, 1.74 Gb for L. occidentalis, and 623.3 Mb for T. solanivora. These datasets are available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (BioProject PRJNA1140410) and serve as essential resources for population genomics studies and the development of effective pest management strategies, addressing significant gaps in the understanding of invasive insect species."
"The ability to study protein dynamics and function in the authentic context of a multicellular organism is paramount to better understand biological phenomena in animal health and disease. Pulse-chase of self-labeling fusion protein tags provide the opportunity to label proteins of interest and track those proteins over time. There are currently several challenges associated with performing in vivo protein pulse-chase in animals, such as cost, reproducibility, and accurate detection methods. The C. elegans model organism has attributes that alleviate many of these challenges. This work tests the feasibility of applying the Halo modified enzyme (HaloTag) for in vivo protein pulse-chase in C. elegans. HaloTag intestinal histone reporters were created in the worm and used to demonstrate that reporter protein could be efficiently pulse-labeled by soaking animals in ligand. Labeled protein stability could be monitored over time by fluorescent confocal microscopy. Further investigation revealed reporter protein stability was dependent on the animals nutritional state. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) of the reporters showed incorporation in chromatin with little change hours into starvation, implying a lack of chromatin regulation at the time point tested. Collectively, this work presents a straightforward method to label and track proteins of interest in C. elegans that can address a multitude of biological questions surrounding protein stability and dynamics in this animal model."
"Many animals use the Earths magnetic field for the purposes of orientation and navigation, although the sensory mechanisms remain unclear. It has been proposed that retinal responses to light may be modulated by magnetic fields. However, to date, there is no evidence for a retinal response to magnetic fields in mammals. Here we show that magnetic fields affect expression of the neuronal activity marker c-Fos in the mouse retina in a light dependent manner. These retinal responses to magnetic fields are abolished in mice lacking the candidate magnetoreceptor cryptochrome. To characterise the signalling pathways involved, we then used RNAseq and cell-type mapping. We also show that magnetic fields increase exploratory behaviour in a visually dependent task and lengthen the period of the retinal circadian clock. Together, our data provide the first evidence for a mammalian retinal response to magnetic fields at a cellular, molecular and functional level, which may influence vision."
"Overweight and reduced muscle mass significantly affect canine health, yet their metabolic implications in dogs require further investigation. This study aimed to characterize metabolic alterations associated with overweight, obesity, and reduced muscle mass in dogs. An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate differences in metabolite concentrations among pet dogs with varying body and muscle conditions. Dogs older than two years were included in the Body Condition Score (BCS) analysis (n=186), while only dogs older than eight years were included in the Muscle Condition Score (MCS) analysis due to age-related sarcopenia (n=99). Metabolomic analyses were performed using a validated, canine-specific nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. Associations between metabolite concentrations and body or muscle condition were examined independently using generalized linear models, adjusting statistically for age and health status. Increasing overweight status correlated with notable disruptions in lipid and glucose metabolism, alongside elevated inflammation markers. Specifically, several lipid metabolites increased linearly with increasing overweight, as did citrate, lactate, pyruvate, and the inflammatory biomarker GlycA. Conversely, decreased muscle mass showed relatively modest independent metabolic effects, including elevated GlycA, an increased phenylalanine-to-tyrosine ratio, and alterations in VLDL subclass composition. Muscle mass was closely associated with age and overall health status, with health status emerging as the primary determinant of metabolite concentrations. Moderate to severe muscle loss was predominantly observed in dogs with underlying diseases. The metabolic consequences of overweight and sarcopenia, particularly increased inflammation common to both conditions, could significantly impact a dogs overall health. These findings reinforce existing evidence regarding the detrimental health effects associated with overweight and sarcopenia in dogs. Furthermore, the study suggests that underlying disease should be suspected in older dogs presenting highly abnormal metabolite profiles or moderate to severe muscle loss."
"MotivationSequence-to-expression models typically do not consider chromatin accessibility, a major factor limiting gene regulation. We hypothesized that supplying accessibility as an input feature would allow a sequenceto-expression model to focus on important open regions of the genome.

ResultsWe found that the performance of such an augmented model was significantly better than that of sequence-only or accessibility-only models with similar architectures. Specifically, its ability to predict the expression of highly variable genes and gene expression in other cell types improved, and higher attribution scores in the input DNA sequences of the augmented model conformed to accessibility, enabling the learning of cell type-specific sequence patterns. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a pre-trained sequence-only model with both sequence and accessibility can boost performance further and highlight the importance of sequencing depth in sequence-toexpression prediction.

"Cyclization is a promising strategy to enhance protein stability, but its applicability is often limited by structural constraints such as the distance between terminal regions. Here, we report the rational design and characterization of a cyclized Tobacco Etch Virus protease (cTEVp) using the SpyRing system, which enables covalent cyclization through SpyTag/SpyCatcher-mediated isopeptide bond formation. We applied this approach to a widely used engineered TEVp variant (L56V, S135G, S219V, {Delta}238-242) and employed AlphaFold structure prediction to optimize linker length and domain positioning. Despite the ~40 [A] separation between the N- and C-termini of native TEVp, AlphaFold modeling suggested that the fused SpyTag and SpyCatcher domains can adopt a favorable configuration for intramolecular cyclization. The resulting cTEVp exhibited proteolytic activity comparable to the non-cyclized TEVp, indicating that structural constraint via SpyRing-mediated cyclization did not impair enzymatic function. Importantly, cTEVp displayed significantly improved thermostability relative to its non-cyclized counterpart, as demonstrated by higher retention of soluble enzyme and residual activity following heat treatment at 50{degrees}C. Our findings validate the effectiveness of SpyRing-mediated cyclization in improving TEVp stability and highlight the utility of computationally guided cyclization as a generalizable strategy for engineering thermally resilient proteins. This study establishes a framework that integrates structure prediction and rational protein engineering, contributing to the development of robust biocatalysts for synthetic biology and industrial biotechnology applications.

"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWRNA is a dynamic biomolecule crucial for cellular regulation, with its function largely determined by its folding into complex structures, while misfolding can lead to multifaceted biological sequelae. During the folding process, RNA traverses through a series of intermediate structural states, with each transition occurring at variable rates that collectively influence the time required to reach the functional form. Understanding these folding kinetics is vital for predicting RNA behavior and optimizing applications in synthetic biology and drug discovery. While in silico kinetic RNA folding simulators are often computationally intensive and time-consuming, accurate approximations of the folding times can already be very informative to assess the efficiency of the folding process. In this work, we present KinPFN, a novel approach that leverages prior-data fitted networks to directly model the posterior predictive distribution of RNA folding times. By training on synthetic data representing arbitrary prior folding times, KinPFN efficiently approximates the cumulative distribution function of RNA folding times in a single forward pass, given only a few initial folding time examples. Our method offers a modular extension to existing RNA kinetics algorithms, promising significant computational speed-ups orders of magnitude faster, while achieving comparable results. We showcase the effectiveness of KinPFN through extensive evaluations and real-world case studies, demonstrating its potential for RNA folding kinetics analysis, its practical relevance, and generalization to other biological data."
"The longstanding challenge of limited exploration in protein receptor conformational space continues to constrain the precision of molecular docking. Ensemble docking, which employs methods such as molecular dynamics simulations to generate multiple receptor conformations for docking, has improved accuracy but remains limited by incomplete sampling and an inability to fully account for ligand-induced fit. To address these limitations, we introduce the concept of individual docking, a novel approach that involves docking against receptor conformations generated individually for each ligand in the docking library. This approach has only very recently become feasible due to advances in protein structure prediction, in particular end-to-end protein-ligand complex prediction technologies exemplified by AlphaFold3 and NeuralPLexer. In this study, we performed individual docking on 27 targets from the DUD-E dataset, using a two-step protocol that integrates NeuralPLexer's inference as the receptor sampling step with subsequent physics-based docking. Our results reveal that individual docking leads to approximately 24% reduction in the enrichment factors compared with standard docking, yet it recovers different sets of active ligands. Detailed analyses of pocket and ligand conformations suggest several potential incompatibilities between deep learning-based and physics-based virtual screening tools."
"Quantifying gene expression across convergent origins of traits clarifies the degree to which those traits arise from shared versus distinct genetic programs, revealing how gene re-use relates to the repeatability of evolution. Eyes are important traits that evolved in many distantly related lineages, including at least nine times within cnidarians. Here, we investigate gene expression in eye-bearing and non-visual tissues from three cnidarian species representing long-diverged lineages where eyes evolved convergently (Cubozoa, Scyphozoa, and Hydrozoa). We find gene expression in eye-bearing tissues to be mostly lineage-specific, with only a small proportion of genes having convergent expression across species. Nevertheless, all species express homologs of deeply conserved vision-related genes known from Bilateria, which likely reflects deep homology (parallel evolution across vast phylogenetic distances) of a metazoan phototransduction toolkit. A gene tree analysis of opsins--the prototypical animal photosensors--shows that convergent eyes recruited different opsin paralogs, with the potential exception of an opsin ortholog shared between scyphozoan and cubozoan eyes. Our results suggest that eyes have mostly lineage-specific patterns of gene expression, yet some key phototransduction components are repeatedly recruited across multiple independent eye origins in Medusozoa."
"As spatial molecular data grow in scope and resolution, there is a pressing need to identify key spatial structures associated with disease. Current approaches often rely on hand-crafted features such as local abundances of manually annotated, discrete cell types, which may overlook important signals. Here we introduce variational inference-based microniche analysis (VIMA), a method that combines deep learning with principled statistics to discover associated spatial features with greater flexibility and precision. VIMA uses a variational autoencoder to extract numerical ""fingerprints"" from small tissue patches that capture their biological content. It uses these fingerprints to define a large number of ""microniches"" - small, potentially overlapping groups of tissue patches with highly similar biology that span multiple samples. It then uses rigorous statistics to identify microniches whose abundance correlates with case-control status. We show in simulations that VIMA is well calibrated and more powerful and accurate than other approaches. We then apply VIMA to a 140-gene spatial transcriptomics dataset in Alzheimers dementia, a 54-marker CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) dataset in ulcerative colitis (UC), and a 7-marker immunohistochemistry dataset in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in each case recapitulating known biology and identifying novel spatial features of disease."
"Fruit shape is an essential agronomic trait that contributes to the commercial value of fruit crops; however, the physiological mechanisms determining fruit shape have been studied only in a few model crops. Persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.), a major fruit crop in East Asia, shows diversity in fruit shape among cultivars. The underlying molecular mechanisms that determine fruit shape remain unclear. A comparative physiological analysis was conducted to investigate the differences between a major Japanese cultivar,  Hiratanenashi with a ""flat"" fruit shape, and its somaclonal mutant cultivar,  Koushimaru with a ""round"" fruit shape. Through principal component analysis (PCA) with the elliptic Fourier descriptor, the fruit shape transitions in these two cultivars were measured over the fruit differentiation period (40-53 days after anthesis). Histological observation of the mesocarp cells in the fruit shape differentiation stage indicated that not only cell proliferation patterns but also multiple vectors involving cell shapes or sizes are possible determinants of differences in fruit shape. Transcriptome analysis at the fruit shape differentiation stage detected differentially expressed genes between the two cultivars. The hierarchical clustering with expression patterns throughout the fruit development/maturation stages defined four main clusters, including candidate genes determining fruit shapes. We focused on one of these genes, DKAch04a32073.t1, annotated as WUSCHEL related homeobox 13 (WOX13), which has been reported to be a key factor in callus formation (or stem cell proliferation) and the reconnection of organs in Arabidopsis thaliana. Future functional analyses of the candidate genes would provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying persimmon fruit shape."
"BACKGROUNDIndividuals with Down Syndrome (DS) frequently develop early onset Alzheimers disease (AD) with pathological hallmarks closely resembling AD due to several triplicated genes on chromosome 21. Polyamines are small, organic molecules that play a pivotal role for growth and differentiation, and a dysregulation of polyamine pathways is implicated in AD pathology. However, their role in DS-associated AD is unclear.

METHODSWe analyzed polyamines and their metabolite levels in mouse hippocampal cells and human DS-AD and AD hippocampal tissue and assessed the effects of the ODC inhibitor difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) on A{beta}42 aggregation and protein expression in DS fibroblasts.

RESULTSAmyloid-{beta}42 increased polyamine levels via ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activation in a dose-dependent manner. DFMO reduced A{beta}42 aggregation, decreased amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels, and normalized proteins linked to AD pathology in DS fibroblasts. Polyamine levels were elevated in DS-AD hippocampal tissue, with colocalization of ODC and A{beta}42 aggregates.

CONCLUSIONThese findings suggest that polyamine biosynthesis may exacerbate A{beta}42 toxicity and APP expression, contributing to AD progression in DS. The ability of DFMO to reduce A{beta}42 aggregation and restore protein homeostasis presents the polyamine pathway as a therapeutic target for DS-AD management."
"Generative models have achieved significant progress in the field of protein design, particularly in the generation of tertiary structures. However, they still face several challenges, such as balancing the designability and diversity of the generated structures, generating specified structures under highly constrained conditions, and the most challenging aspect, direct functional design such as motifs and binders. We present OriginFlow, an efficient protein generative model that combines Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) models and flow models based on flow matching. The generated structures exhibit state-of-the-art (SOTA) levels of designability, diversity, and novelty. Moreover, this model demonstrates outstanding performance in functional design aspects such as motifs, binders, and symmetric motif scaffolding. We performed binder design for multiple targets, and all results showed excellent affinity performance in AF3 complex predictions and MD experiments. Wet-lab validation was conducted on PD-L1, RBD, and VEGF targets, achieving 90% expression, solubility, and affinity. These results are significantly superior to all current AI binder design algorithms."
"Membrane tension is an acknowledged regulator of a wide array of cell functions; however, whether it acts locally or globally in different contexts remains debated. Recent experiments that locally perturb tension and measure the response elsewhere on the membrane are not conclusive, and the mechanism of diffusive tension relaxation has been called into doubt. Here, we consider the tension response to a sudden extension of a membrane tether, and report a quantitative signature of dynamic tension relaxation, which up to now is missing. We present a theory based on tension diffusion leading to a prediction of power-law decay in time of the force holding the tether, with a material-independent exponent of 1/3. This prediction is confirmed to within a few percent by re-analyzing eleven sets of tether data from two cell types with distinct membrane cortical architectures. Overall, our scaling results indicate the absence of a relevant characteristic length and therefore generically reflect tension relaxation by long-range membrane lipid flows."
"Multicellular organisms rely on inter-organ communication networks to maintain vital parameters within a dynamic physiological range. Macrophages are central to this homeostatic control system, sensing deviations of those parameters and responding accordingly to support tissue function and organismal homeostasis. Here we demonstrate that dysregulation of iron metabolism in parenchyma cells, imposed by the deletion of ferritin H chain, is sensed by monocyte-derived macrophages. In response, macrophages derived from circulating monocytes support tissue function, energy metabolism and thermoregulation, as demonstrated in bone marrow chimeric and parabiotic mice. This salutary effect is contingent on a transcriptional program, controlled in macrophages by the transcription factor A mitochondria. This transcriptional response acts in a non-cell autonomous manner to support the mitochondria of parenchyma cells, irrespectively of mitochondrial transfer. In conclusion, monocyte-derived macrophages cross-regulate Fe and energy metabolism to support tissue function and organismal homeostasis."
"Host defense against many Gram-positive bacteria and fungal pathogens is mainly provided by the Toll-dependent systemic immune response in Drosophila. While antimicrobial peptides active against these categories of pathogens contribute only modestly to protection, Bomanin peptides are major effectors of the Toll pathway. Remarkably, flies deleted for the 55C locus that contains 10 Bomanin genes are as sensitive as Toll pathway mutant flies to these infections. Yet, the exact functions of single Bomanins in resistance or resilience to infections remain poorly characterized. Here, we have extensively studied the role of these Bomanin genes. BomT1 functions in resistance to Enterococcus faecalis while playing a role in resilience against Metarhizium robertsii infection, like BomS2. BomT1 and BomT2 prevent the dissemination of Candida albicans throughout the host, even though they are not sufficient to confer protection to immunodeficient flies against this pathogen in survival experiments. Furthermore, BomT1 and BomBc1 mutants are sensitive to an Aspergillus fumigatus ribotoxin. We conclude that 55C Bomanins have defined albeit sometimes overlapping roles in the different facets of host defense against infections."
"Inhibitory control relies on coordinated beta-band activity within a fronto-basal ganglia network, which implements inhibition via downstream effects on (pre)motor areas. In this study, we employed dual-site transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) targeting the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) and primary motor cortex (M1) to directly manipulate phase relationships in the beta band and assess their effects on both functional connectivity and motor inhibition. Fifty-two healthy participants received in-phase, anti-phase and sham stimulation while performing a stop-signal task. The results revealed that connectivity between rIFG and lM1 increased following in-phase but decreased after anti-phase stimulation. Although no direct modulation of task performance was observed, the greater connectivity increase between the targets during in-phase stimulation was predictive of faster inhibitory performance. In contrast, greater connectivity decreases during anti-phase stimulation were related to faster go responses, suggesting a shift towards less inhibition on the motor system. These findings provide evidence that dual-site beta-tACS can both enhance and impair inhibitory control depending on phase alignment, highlighting its potential as a non-invasive intervention for disorders marked by impaired inhibition."
"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for the modulation of ongoing eye movements provides an ideal model for investigating sensorimotor integration. Within neural networks subserving smooth pursuit eye movements, visual motion area V5 is a core hub to integrate visual motion information with oculomotor control. Here, we applied personalized tDCS explicitly targeting individual V5 in healthy human participants using algorithmic optimization informed by functional magnetic resonance imaging and combined electro- and magnetencephalography. We hypothesized subtle modulation of sensorimotor integration during pursuit and assessed the gain by personalized tDCS targeting V5, compared to personalized tDCS targeting the frontal eye field, as well as conventional normative tDCS over V5. Indeed, pursuit initiation was specifically delayed during personalized cathodal tDCS targeting right V5 indicating the involvement of distinct functional subregions of V5 in the initial sensorimotor integration of visual motion information with pursuit eye movements, but not the maintenance of ongoing pursuit. The results were well-controlled by anodal and sham tDCS, different pursuit tasks, finite-element simulations of individual electric fields, and by two additional control experiments, one that applied personalized tDCS targeting frontal eye field and another that applied normative tDCS over V5. Importantly, in contrast to personalized tDCS targeting FEF and normative tDCS over V5, personalized tDCS targeting V5 effectively modulated pursuit by adapting electric fields to individual anatomical and functional V5 properties. Our results provide evidence for the specific involvement of area V5 in sensorimotor integration during pursuit initiation and the ability of (targeted) tDCS to specifically introduce subtle modulation of the brain network underlying smooth pursuit eye movements. Further, our results indicate the potential of personalized tDCS to alter behavior as the main aspect of interest in human neuromodulation."
"Free radicals can cause oxidative stress in the body, which, in turn, leads to various diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and others. To protect against the destructive effects of radicals, living organisms utilize antioxidants. One of the most important classes of antioxidants is polyphenols. The primary effect of polyphenols on the body is associated with their ability to capture and neutralize free radicals, as well as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. This study focuses on investigating the antioxidant activity (AA) of polyphenols and their compositions based on rutin, quercetin, and trans-cinnamic acid, produced by in vitro cell cultures, with the aim of developing dietary supplements with geroprotective properties. The AA of the studied substances was assessed using the ABTS and DPPH free radical scavenging methods. The study established that, according to the ABTS method, AA decreases in the order of quercetin > rutin > trans-cinnamic acid, while according to the DPPH method, the order is rutin > quercetin > trans-cinnamic acid. Among the tested mixtures, the highest AA was observed in mixture No. 8 and mixture No. 3, regardless of the assessment method. Consequently, to achieve the highest AA in a mixture, a higher content of quercetin and a minimal amount of trans-cinnamic acid should be included, while the optimal amount of rutin could not be determined. It is assumed that the amount of rutin should be at least equal to the amount of trans-cinnamic acid and ideally equal to the amount of quercetin. Thus, when developing dietary supplements with high AA, it is more advisable to include only quercetin rather than mixtures that also contain rutin and trans-cinnamic acid."
"Oceanic islands are remote environments commonly harboring endemic species, which often are unique lineages originated and maintained by a variety of ecological, biogeographical and evolutionary processes. Endemic species are found mostly in a single oceanic island or archipelago, however, a great number of species can be considered multiple-island endemics, i.e. species found on multiple oceanic islands that still have a restricted distribution. The geographic criteria chosen to classify endemic species has a direct impact on the endemism rate of islands, and many studies have used multiple scales of endemism (single and multiple-island endemics), which has historically influenced wide-scale comparisons. In this perspective, we accessed the importance of single and multiple-island endemic species to the biodiversity of oceanic islands, introducing the concept of Provincial-island endemism as an additional strategy to standardize biogeography studies."
"Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) offer great potential to improve the quality of life for individuals with neurological disorders or severe motor impairments. Among various neural recording modalities, electroencephalogram (EEG) is particularly favorable for BMIs due to its noninvasive nature, portability, and high temporal resolution. Existing EEG datasets for BMIs are often limited to experimental settings that fail to address subjects freewill in decision making. We present a large EEG dataset, containing a total of 6808 trials, recorded from 23 healthy young adults (8 females and 15 males with an age range from 18 to 24 years) while performing reaching and grasping tasks, where the target object is freely chosen at their desired pace according to their own will. This EEG dataset provides a realistic representation of reaching and grasping movement, making it useful for developing practical BMIs."
"RNA polymerase II (Pol II) facilitates co-transcriptional splicing by recruiting the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (U1 snRNP) to the nascent transcripts. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a transcribing Pol II-U1 snRNP complex with elongation factors DSIF and SPT6. Furthermore, our biochemical analysis revealed that the phosphorylated Pol II carboxyl-terminal domain and SPT6 interact directly with U1 snRNP proteins, facilitating its recruitment to the elongation complex. This multivalent interaction allows efficient spliceosome assembly and ensures transcription processivity."
"The amygdala, a key limbic structure, is critical to emotional, social, and appetitive behaviors that develop throughout adolescence. Composed of a heterogeneous group of nuclei, questions remain about potential differences in the maturation of its subregions during development. In 3,953 9- and 10-year-olds from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentlZI Study, the CIT168 Amygdala Atlas was used to segment nine amygdala subregions. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the effects of age, sex, pubertal stage, and body mass index z-score (BMIz) on subregion volumes and their relative apportionment within the amygdala. Distinct associations were observed between age, sex, and BMIz and whole amygdala volume, subregion volumes, and subregion apportionment. Pubertal stage was not related to amygdala subregion volumes. Age was associated with near-global expansion of amygdala subregions during this developmental period. Female sex was linked to smaller volumes in most amygdala subregions, with larger relative apportionment in the dorsal subregions and smaller apportionment in the basolateral ventral paralaminar subregion. Higher BMIz was associated with smaller volumes in large basolateral subregions, with increased relative apportionment in smaller subregions. These findings provide a foundational context for understanding how developmental variables influence amygdala structure, with implications for understanding future risk for brain disorders.

"AbstractPredicting plant community functional traits is considered a Holy Grail of trait-based ecology because traits underpin ecosystem processes. Previous statistical, machine learning, and optimality approaches have produced global plant trait predictions. However, the utility of trait-based vegetation models, which include demographic processes and can represent trait diversity, remains unexplored at this scale.

We use aDGVM2-LL, a trait- and individual-based dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM). aDGVM2-LL simulates community assembly, which is driven by natural selection, biotic, and abiotic conditions; simulated specific leaf area (SLA) is an emergent outcome of community assembly. We examine: 1) how well aDGVM2-LL can simulate global SLA by examining deviations from trait data, and 2) explore drivers of strong deviations.

Compared to GBIF-derived SLA data, aDGVM2-LL displays mean SLA differences of -2.9 (m2/kg)(GBIF range ca. 4 - 35 m2/kg), a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.25, and normalised mean absolute error (nMAE) of 26.54%. Published statistical, machine learning, and optimality approaches displayed differences with GBIF-derived trait data which range between (mean : -4.83 - 2.67, RMSE: 4.41 - 6.68, nMAE: 13.41% - 25.20%). Thus, aDGVM2-LL mean differences are comparable with published predictions while RMSEs and nMAEs are higher. Large aDGVM2-LL mismatches occur in areas where the model incorrectly simulates the relative abundances of deciduous vs. evergreen leaf phenologies. Correcting mismatches in leaf phenological abundances strongly reduces the range of mean SLA differences (-0.14 - 0.43), RMSEs (5.85 - 5.90), and nMAEs (15.44% - 20.61%).

These results show that an eco-evolutionary, process-based approach can reasonably simulate global SLA values, particularly when leaf phenological abundances are accurate. Our results highlight the general importance of the global drivers of leaf phenology for leaf traits. The correct simulation of the relative abundances of deciduous and evergreen leaf phenologies is crucial to predict contemporary and future SLA."
"Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential nutrient for most living organisms, serving as a cofactor in a diverse array of molybdoenzymes that catalyze key reactions in several elemental cycles. However, geochemical data suggest that dissolved Mo concentrations in the Archean ocean (before 2.5 billion years ago) were 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than today, raising questions about its bioavailability to early life. Here, we apply a phylogenomic approach to chart the modern biological and environmental distribution of Mo-related enzymes and use phylogenetic reconciliations to reconstruct the evolutionary history of biological Mo usage. Our results reveal the ubiquity of molybdoenzymes across contemporary organisms inhabiting diverse environments. Furthermore, phylogenetic evidence indicates that the earliest molybdoenzymes stem back to the Paleo/Mesoarchean (~3.5-3.0 Gya), facilitating critical energy-harnessing reactions in some of Earths most ancient life forms. Taken together, our findings challenge the prevailing view of limited Mo bioavailability on the anoxic early Earth."
"Uncertainty persists regarding the contribution of tissue macrophages to HIV reservoirs, largely due to insufficient characterization of these reservoirs within their native tissue microenvironments. This study aimed to characterize and quantify macrophage reservoirs in human lymph node (LN) tissues in terms of their phenotype, location, and their potential for sustained productive infection during suppressive antiretroviral therapy.

We examined the topology, nature, and size of macrophage reservoirs in lymph nodes (LNs) from 45 PLWH subtype C on suppressive ART and 14 matched controls using in situ imaging and multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy. Germinal center CD68+ macrophages harbored HIV gag-pol DNA, HIV gag-pol RNA and Gagp24 protein. Digital droplet PCR confirmed the presence of proviral reservoirs in myeloid cells within LNs. High-resolution imaging techniques revealed that infected macrophages within GCs displayed distinct morphological characteristics, featuring larger and irregular shapes. In contrast, phagocytic macrophages exhibited intracellular staining for CD4+ T cells, had regular shapes, and were predominantly found outside the GCs.

Our findings provide detailed quantitative, spatial, and phenotypic characterization of macrophage reservoirs in LNs, offering a clear estimation of the extent to which macrophages contribute to persistent HIV reservoirs in these tissues. These findings establish a basis for developing targeted strategies aimed at the elimination of these reservoirs in LN tissues.

Author summaryHIV hides in reservoirs within immune cells across the body in the blood and various tissues, making it a complex challenge to cure. Therefore, it is essential to identify and understand all sources of HIV reservoirs aid the development of an HIV cure. Macrophages are increasingly recognized as key contributors of viral reservoir persistence. However, the role of macrophages as latent HIV reservoirs remains unclear due to limited studies in human tissues. In this study we investigated macrophage reservoirs in human lymph nodes to answer key questions: where do they hide, how can we identify them, what is their contribution to the lymph node reservoir burden, and are they truly able to support productive viral replication? We found that macrophages residing within lymph node germinal centers, identified by CD68 expression, contained HIV DNA, RNA, and Gagp24 protein. Moreover, using high resolution microscopy, we were able to distinguish between productively infected macrophages from those that engulfed T cells. By unveiling these unique features of macrophage reservoirs, our research paves the way for the design of targeted therapy aimed at eliminating these reservoirs, towards an HIV cure."
"Balamuthia mandrillaris is a free-living amoeba that can infect the central nervous system to cause granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE), a highly fatal disease with mortality rates up to 90%. GAE is typically treated with a six-drug regimen with limited efficacy and significant toxicity. Our lab previously identified nitroxoline, a quinolone antibiotic, as a promising therapeutic complement to the existing regimen, and in 2021 nitroxoline was first successfully used to treat a human patient. In this study, we elucidate nitroxolines mechanism of action using a combination of genomics, transcriptomics, chemical complementation, growth assays, and electron microscopy. In service of this goal, an annotated draft genome of B. mandrillaris strain CDC:V039 was generated using long read sequencing, yielding 88 telomere-to-telomere contigs and over 25,000 protein coding genes. Leveraging this resource, comparative transcriptomics were used to characterize encystment responses to three different cellular stressors: nitroxoline, galactose, and hypoxia. Our findings reveal that nitroxoline-induced cysts undergo transcriptional collapse and genomic and structural destabilization via copper and iron chelation. These data provide insight into nitroxolines multifaceted impact on B. mandrillaris growth and cellular processes and advance our understanding of the transcriptional landscape associated with stress induced encystment. Our findings support the continued clinical study of nitroxoline."
"How to improve the drugs bioavailability has always been a hot and difficult topic. Conventional drug delivery methods, such as oral administration and the blood circulation system, suffer from issues such as low targeting efficiency, low bioavailability, and high side effects. Recently, interstitium has gradually been recognized as an important new organ. Interstitial injection allows small molecules to move through interstitial channels with interstitial fluid flow and be transported to organs, providing new possibilities for drug delivery. In this study, using fluorescein sodium as a drug model, we systematically investigated the distribution of the fluorescein sodium in organs and body surface of the rats after ventral midline interstitial channels injection. In addition, we observed the microstructure of the ventral midline interstitial channels of abdominal wall and the effects of channels ligation on fluorescein sodium delivery and target organs, to explore the mechanism of interstitial injection. We found that fluorescein sodium can be efficiently transported to the uterus and ovaries along the ventral midline interstitial channels, and the parallel fibers and interconnected interstitial spaces of the channels facilitate long-distance transport of solutes. Additionally, the blockage of the transmission through those channels had results in a significant decrease in targeted transport efficiency over long distances, a decrease in oestrogen levels, organ coefficients, and body weights in female rats. Therefore, the ventral midline interstitial channels with free fluid flow may be a potential communication pathway between body surface and organs. These findings have significant value in the development of drug delivery."
"In the last decade, DNA-DNA proximity ligation assays opened powerful new ways to study the 3D organization of genomes and have become a mainstay experimental technology. Yet many aspects of these experiments remain poorly understood. We study the inner workings of DNA-DNA proximity ligation assays through numerical experiments and theoretical modeling. Chromosomes are modeled at nucleosome resolution and evolved in time via molecular dynamics. A virtual Hi-C experiment reproduces, in-silico, the different steps of the Hi-C protocol, including: crosslinking of chromatin to an underlying proteic matrix, enzymatic digestion of DNA, and subsequent proximity ligation of DNA open ends. The protocol is simulated on ensembles of different structures as well as individual structures, enabling the construction of ligation maps and the calculation of ligation probabilities as functions of genomic and Euclidean distance. The methods help to assess the effect of the many variables of the Hi-C experiment and of subsequent data processing methods on the quality of the final results."
"Symbiotic relationships with microorganisms are fundamental to life on Earth, yet relatively little is known about how these interactions persist through time, how they co-evolve, and to which degree they are genetically constrained. In this study, three cardinalfish species in the genus Siphamia, S. tubifer, S. mossambica, and S. fuscolineata, were analyzed for patterns of genetic divergence along with their luminous bacterial symbionts, from locations throughout the hosts broad Indo-Pacific distribution. Using whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the fish light organ, we investigated whether the specificity of the association is maintained across host species and over this geographic range and whether there are any patterns of symbiont divergence associated with either. Our results indicated that the light organ symbionts of all three Siphamia species examined were identified as Photobacterium mandapamensis, suggesting a high degree of specificity of the symbiosis is conserved across hosts and geography. There was evidence of biogeographic structure in the symbiont between the three sampling regions, but no co-diversification between the hosts and their symbionts (p = 0.92). However, an analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between two S. tubifer populations sampled from Japan and the Philippines indicated some genetic differentiation (FST = 0.043) with phylogenetically-distinct clades of symbionts. Overall, these findings indicate that the association between Siphamia hosts and P. mandapamensis is highly conserved, yet there is significant genetic diversity within the symbionts driven by geography and potentially host ecology."
"Membrane contact sites (MCS) establish organelle interactomes in cells to enable communication and exchange of materials. Volume electron microscopy (vEM) is ideally suited for MCS analyses, but semantic segmentation of large vEM datasets remains challenging. Recent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) for segmentation has greatly enhanced our analysis capabilities. However, we show that organelle boundaries, which are important for defining MCS, are the least confident predictions made by AI. We outline a segmentation strategy termed AI-directed Voxel Extraction (AIVE), that combines AI predictions with image electron signals to confidently segment membrane boundaries irrespective of the AI model used. We demonstrate the precision conferred by AIVE by applying it to the quantitative analysis of organelle interactomes from multiple FIB-SEM datasets. Through AIVE, we discover a previously unknown category of mitochondrial contact that we term the mitochondrial intrusion. We hypothesise that intrusions serve as anchors that stabilize MCS and promote organelle communication."
"BackgroundIntegrating short-read and long-read sequencing technologies has become a promising approach for achieving accurate and comprehensive genomic analysis. While short-read sequencing (Illumina, etc.) offers high base accuracy and cost efficiency, it struggles with structural variation (SV) detection and complex genomic regions. In contrast, long-read sequencing (PacBio HiFi) excels in resolving large SVs and repetitive sequences but is limited by throughput, higher Indel error rates, and sequencing costs. Hybrid approaches may combine these technologies and leverage their complementary strengths and different sources of error to provide higher accuracy, more comprehensive results, and higher throughput by lowering the coverage requirement for the long reads.

MethodsThis study benchmarks the DNAscope Hybrid pipeline, a novel integrated alignment and variant calling framework that combines short- and long-read data sequenced from the same sample. We evaluate its performance across multiple human genome reference datasets (HG002-HG004) using the draft Q100 and Genome in a Bottle v4.2.1 benchmarks. The pipelines ability to detect small variants (SNPs/Indels), structural variants (SVs), and copy number variations (CNVs) is assessed using data from the Illumina and Pacbio sequencing systems at varying read depths (5x-30x). Benchmark results are compared to DeepVariant.

ResultsThe DNAscope Hybrid pipeline significantly improves SNP and Indel calling accuracy, particularly in complex genomic regions. At lower long-read depths (e.g., 5x-10x), the hybrid approach outperforms standalone short- or long-read pipelines at full sequencing depths (30x-35x). Additionally, the DNAscope Hybrid outperforms leading open-source tools for SV and CNV detection, enhancing variant discovery in challenging genomic regions. The pipeline also demonstrates clinical utility by identifying disease- associated variants. Moreover, DNAscope Hybrid is highly efficient, achieving less than 90 minutes runtimes at single standard instance.

ConclusionThe DNAscope Hybrid pipeline is a computationally efficient, highly accurate variant calling framework that leverages the advantages of both short- and long-read sequencing. By improving variant detection in challenging genomic regions and offering a robust solution for clinical and large-scale genomic applications, it holds significant promise for genetic disease diagnostics, population-scale studies, and personalized medicine."
"Lentiviral vectors are a cornerstone delivery modality of biomedical research, renowned for their ability to stably integrate genetic material into the host genome, enabling sustained transgene expression and long-term genetic manipulation. These properties make them indispensable tools in functional genomics and genome engineering, particularly for delivering molecular components in high-throughput CRISPR screening, a powerful approach for uncovering the genetic basis of complex cellular mechanisms and phenotypes. However, challenges such as lentiviral-induced recombination, unpredictable integration profiles, and variable susceptibility of target cells to transduction can introduce noise and compromise experimental outcomes.

In this study, we selected two suspension-adapted mammalian cell lines, Chinese Hamster Ovary cells CHO-K1 and Human Embryonic Kidney cells HEK293-6E, due to their widespread use in recombinant protein production. Recognizing the influence of intrinsic cell line properties and transduction methodology, we compared two distinct procedures: spinoculation and static transduction. By implementing a two-step static transduction protocol, we achieved significantly higher transduction efficiencies while minimizing cellular stress, streamlining workflows, and eliminating scalability limitations inherent to large-scale lentiviral applications like genome-wide CRISPR screens. To further characterize the variation in lentiviral integration, we used droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to quantify copy number variation (CNV) both at the pooled population level and within individual clonal isolates.

This comprehensive analysis underscores the robustness of our optimized protocol in enhancing transduction efficiency in difficult-to-transduce suspension cell lines. It further emphasizes the importance of carefully modulating infection rates to limit multiple integrations, ensuring the accuracy and consistency required for large-scale functional genomics applications."
"O_LIInsects are of crucial importance for terrestrial ecosystems but many populations decline rapidly. Conventional collecting methods are usually time-consuming, resulting in a low temporal, spatial and taxonomic resolution of data. Automated camera light traps (CLT) allow non-lethal monitoring of species-rich moths (Lepidoptera) and other nocturnal insects, but so far little is known about their performance compared to conventional collecting methods.
C_LIO_LIBy observing the behaviour of moths in previous field work, we hypothesized that CLT perform well in moth groups in which species tend to sit down quietly after approaching the lamp (such as Geometridae) but worse in moth groups in which species are persistently active (such as Sphingidae).
C_LIO_LIWe tested the performance of two CLTs, equipped with Sony alpha 7II (24 megapixel sensor) cameras that resulted in images with approx. 420 dpi resolution. The study was carried out in a forested area near Bielefeld in NW Germany for 196 nights in a row from April to September 2023, and photos were taken every two minutes during the night. All macromoths recognizable in the photos were identified and counted individually. We directly compared the data from the CLTs with moth samples obtained from conventional funnel light traps (FLTs) during 12 nights which were spread across the flight season.
C_LIO_LIThe resulting 420 dpi images from the CLTs allowed reliable species identification of all observed macromoths with only few exceptions due to technical problems. In direct comparison during 12 nights, CLTs recorded 39 species exclusively, FLTs recorded 48 species exclusively, and 53 species were recorded by both methods equally. During the whole sampling period of 196 nights in a row, a total of 225 moth species were recorded by CLTs. CLTs tended to record Geometridae better than FLTs whereas Sphingidae tended to be undersampled by the new method. Familes differed in the length to which they remained on the screen of the CLTs.
C_LIO_LIOur study is the first to systematically compare the methods and it shows that CLTs perform overall very well. Results from CLTs differ to a certain extent from conventional trapping methods because they seem to perform worse in groups with highly active species and perform better in calmer groups like geometrid moths. CLTs are promising devices for insect monitoring since they deliver data with high resolution in time, space and taxonomy. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) for the analysis of images is intended as the next logic step.

"Drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction is a fundamental problem in drug discovery. Computational methods for predicting DTA can greatly assist drug design by decreasing the search space and reducing the number of protein-ligand complexes with low affinity. Currently DTA approaches often do not require protein three-dimensional (3D) structural information, which is often not accessible. In this study we present the DrugForm-DTA model, which uses only structure-less representations of ligand and protein. It is a Transformer-based neural network with protein encoding based on ESM, and small molecule ligand encoding obtained with Chemformer.

We evaluated the model on standard benchmarks Davis and KIBA, and revealed superior performance of DrugForm-DTA with best result for KIBA (MSE=0.117). Moreover, we developed a ready-to-use model using BindingDB dataset that was subjected to high-quality filtering and transformation. Overall, our method predicts drug-target affinity values with a confidence level comparable to a single in-vitro experiment. Also, we compared DrugForm-DTA against molecular modeling methods and revealed higher efficacy of the developed model for drug-target affinity predictions.

Our investigation provides a high accuracy neural network model with performance comparable to experi-mental measurements, filtered and reassessed BindingDB dataset for further usage, and demonstrates outstanding applicability of the proposed method for DTA prediction.

Author summaryPredicting drug-target binding affinity is a crucial task in computational drug discovery. Here we present DrugForm-DTA, a ready-to-use Transformer-based model which requires only protein amino acid sequence and ligand SMILES as inputs. The model shows excellent results at commonly used benchmarks.

We believe that the success in solving machine learning tasks depends on data quality and quantity, so the main focus of our work is the training data, but not a sophisticated neural architecture. We used BindingDB database as the source of experimental affinity measurements and prepared a refined and purified dataset, suitable for training machine learning models. Trained on this dataset, the DrugForm-DTA model demonstrates accuracy, comparable to a single in-vitro experiment. We also reveal that our model outperforms molecular modeling methods in estimating binding affinity. Both the prepared dataset and the trained model is published and freely available."
"Plant cells respond to a wide range of stimuli through intracellular calcium (Ca2+) signaling. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) are a major class of plant Ca2+ channels, with 20 homologs in Arabidopsis. These tetrameric plasma membrane proteins act downstream of diverse signals, such as phytohormones, extracellular damage, cell wall integrity or temperature. Here, we identify a class of plant-specific proteins, Armadillo Repeat Only (ARO), as essential regulators of possibly all plant CNGCs. Abrogation of functional sporophytic AROs results in a phenotypic pattern strongly reminiscent of CNGC dysfunction, including defects in root gravitropism, root hair growth and morphology, stomatal movement, and responses to extracellular ATP and the phytohormone auxin. aro2/3/4 mutants are fully resistant to the toxic effects caused by overexpression of CNGCs. AROs colocalize and physically interact with multiple CNGCs and modulate CNGC-dependent currents in Xenopus oocytes. Structural modeling and site-directed mutagenesis reveal AROs tetramer formation surrounding the CNGC channel, interacting via its IQ domain. Taken together, plant CNGC channels dont act alone, but in a larger complex - channelosome, first of a kind in plants."
"Equine herpesvirus (EHV) 1 and EHV-4 are common viral pathogens of horses that can cause upper respiratory disease, neurological disease, abortion, or death. As characteristic alphaherpesviruses, both EHV-1 and EHV-4 can establish latency, resulting in a lifelong carrier state in infected animals. Here we describe the development and validation of a rapid and sensitive multiplex real-time PCR assay (EHV1-4MP) that simultaneously detects EHV-1 and EHV-4 and includes an endogenous internal control targeting the equid genome. The EHV1-4MP assay analytical sensitivity was determined to be 15 genome copies for EHV-1, EHV-4, and equid MC1R per reaction. Analytical specificity was determined using a panel of 28 equine respiratory pathogens and commensal equine microorganisms. The EHV1-4MP assay detected reference and clinical isolates of EHV-1 and EHV-4, and did not detect other equine herpesviruses such as EHV-2, EHV-3, EHV-5, or several other viral and bacterial pathogens of horses. Importantly, the EHV1-4MP assay developed here has improved specificity compared to existing assays and is able to exclude the closely related EHV-3, EHV-8, and -9 viruses. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using 60 clinical samples including upper respiratory swabs and washes, blood, placenta, lung, and brain. The EHV1-4MP assay results were in 100% concordance with singleplex EHV-1 and EHV-4 assays. Our results demonstrate that the EHV1-4MP real-time assay developed here offers rapid, sensitive, and simultaneous detection of EHV-1 and EHV-4.

ImportanceEquine herpesvirus (EHV) 1 and -4 are highly contagious and ubiquitous pathogens that commonly cause fever and respiratory disease, and can lead to outbreaks, abortion, neurological disease, or death. Here we describe the development and validation of a rapid and sensitive multiplex real-time PCR assay (EHV1-4MP) that simultaneously detects EHV-1 and EHV-4 as well as an endogenous equid control and an exogenous DNA control, with improved specificity compared to existing assays."
"Over the past three decades, theoretical population genetic models and empirical analyses have elaborated on how the elimination of deleterious variants reduces variation at linked neutral sites. This process is known as background selection. However, the impact of background selection has been studied almost exclusively without reference to its effect on phenotypic variation. Here, we use population genetic theory and simulation to investigate the consequences of background selection for linked variation impacting complex traits. We find the impact of background selection on a complex trait depends on the type of selection acting on the trait, the effect size distribution, and the background selection intensity. For instance, background selection impacts a much broader range of effect sizes for traits under directional selection via a liability threshold mechanism (i.e. when selection acts on individuals with phenotypes exceeding a threshold) than when fitness decays exponentially with trait value. We also find that background selection can increase the population prevalence of a liability threshold trait (e.g. a complex binary disease trait). Furthermore, while background selection can only reduce the genetic variance of a trait under directional selection (as might be expected from the classical population genetic theory for linked neutral variants) we find that background selection can increase the genetic variance of a trait under stabilizing selection. The results presented here use a synthesis of population genetic and quantitative genetic modeling, and overall, have relevance for understand the genetic architecture and evolution of complex traits, including complex diseases.

SignificancePhysical linkage of genetic variants to nearby deleterious mutations shapes their evolution. The effect of this linkage is similar to a reduction in population size, because chromosomes carrying deleterious alleles are quickly removed. This leads to reduced genetic variation for neutral variants, and for variants under weak directional selection. Here, we analyze the impact of linkage in models of selection on complex, polygenic traits. We find that when selection acts on traits through a threshold, linkage reduces genetic variation for much more strongly selected sites than existing theory predicts. In contrast, if selection stabilizes trait values toward an optimum, then linkage may actually increase genetic variation. Understanding the fully effect of linkage therefore requires understand how selection acts on traits.

"During the first cell fate decision in mammalian embryos the inner cell mass cells, which will give rise to the embryo proper and other extraembryonic tissues, segregate from the trophectoderm cells, the precursors of the placenta. Cell fate segregation proceeds in a gradual manner encompassing two rounds of cell division, as well as cell positional and morphological changes. While it is known that the activity of the Hippo signaling pathway and the subcellular localization of its downstream effector YAP dictate lineage specific gene expression, the response of YAP to these dynamic cellular changes remains incompletely understood. Here we address these questions by quantitative live imaging of endogenously tagged YAP while simultaneously monitoring geometric cellular features and cell cycle progression throughout cell fate segregation. We apply a probabilistic model to our dynamic data, providing a quantitative characterization of the mutual effects of YAP and cellular relative exposed area, which has previously been shown to correlate with subcellular YAP localization in fixed samples. Additionally, we study how nuclear YAP levels are influenced by other factors, such as the decreasing pool of maternally provided YAP that is partitioned to daughter cells through cleavage divisions, cell cycle-associated nuclear volume changes, and a delay after divisions in adjusting YAP levels to new cell positions. Interestingly, we find that establishing low nuclear YAP levels required for the inner cell mass fate is largely achieved by passive cell cycle-associated mechanisms. Moreover, contrary to expectations, we find that mechanical perturbations that result in cell shape changes do not influence YAP localization in the embryo. Together our work identifies how various inputs are integrated over a dynamic developmental time course to shape the levels of a key molecular determinant of the first cell fate choice."
"Animals adapt to environments by learning even when experience is limited, which is critical for their survival in nature. However, the relationship between experience richness and learning efficiency remains elusive. Here we investigated this issue using mice eyeblink conditioning with three distinct training paradigms. Surprisingly, 1/9th of sensory pairings than conventional ones were not only sufficient for acquisition of conditioned responses, relying on the activity of deep cerebellar nuclei as usual, but also resulted in more efficient learning. On the other hand, the learning established by limited training was more susceptible for extinction. Modeling of establishment and extinction processes, coupled with experimental validation of the model prediction, unveiled that memories for execution of eyeblink and its suppression are independently formed irrespective of their temporal order."
"Background/ObjectivesRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) exhibits distinctive metabolic vulnerabilities that may be therapeutically targeted. This study investigates how tigecycline, an FDA-approved antibiotic that inhibits mitochondrial translation, affects RCC cells and explores potential combinatorial approaches to enhance its efficacy.

MethodsWe employed comprehensive metabolomic profiling, subcellular proteomics, and functional assays to characterize the effects of tigecycline on RCC cell lines, patient-derived organoids, and xenograft models. The synergistic potential of tigecycline with the histone deacetylase inhibitor entinostat was evaluated using combination index analysis.

ResultsTigecycline selectively inhibited mitochondrial translation in RCC cells, reducing mitochondrially-encoded proteins while sparing nuclear-encoded components, profoundly disrupting mitochondrial bioenergetics and reducing tumor growth in xenograft models. Subcellular proteomic analyses revealed that tigecycline treatment triggered significant accumulation of multiple histone variants concurrent with cell cycle arrest. Based on this discovery, combined treatment with tigecycline and entinostat demonstrated remarkable synergism across RCC cell lines and patient derived organoids.

ConclusionsOur findings identify a promising therapeutic opportunity by targeting the crosstalk between mitochondrial function and epigenetic homeostasis in RCC, with potential for rapid clinical translation given the established pharmacological profiles of both agents."
"The temporal, spatial and cellular diversity of the small intestinal epithelium during the postnatal period, a critical time window that accompanies the transition from placental energy supply to enteral feeding, the establishment of the enteric microbiota and postnatal immune maturation, has not been systematically investigated. Here, we used laser capture microdissection and bulk RNA-Seq, proteomics, and single cell RNA-Seq to analyse the total, organ site, crypt- and villus-specific intestinal epithelium of specific pathogen-free, germ-free and Salmonella-infected mice during the postnatal period. We identified key temporal and organ-site specific expression patterns that revealed a weak effect of the microbiota but strong influence of developmental regulators during early life. We also determined age-dependent signalling pathway and transcription factor activity and characterised age- and cell type-specific developmental trajectories revealing a distinct compartmentalised maturation process along the proximal-to-distal length and crypt-villus axis and a discontinuous appearance of goblet/Paneth cell and absorptive enterocyte transcriptional profiles. Finally, we described the cell type-specific response to neonatal enteric infection. Taken together, our findings identify the epithelium as an integral element in the maturation of postnatal mucosal tissues and in the establishment of host-microbe homeostasis."
"Pattern recognition receptor (PRR) ligands hold great promise as adjuvants and immunotherapeutics. Here, we demonstrate that chemical conjugation of PRR ligands results in synergistic immune response amplification inaccessible to unlinked agonist mixtures. To identify potent immune agonists, we synthesized conjugated PRR ligands incorporating distinct agonist pairings, each targeting two carefully selected PRRs. We used a phenotypic screen using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to single out chimeric PRR ligands capable of inducing robust immune response both in terms of cytokine response and cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Chimeric TLR4/TLR7 and TLR7/RIG-I ligands showed broad immune activation in vitro as well as enhancement of antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses in mice. Intratumoral delivery of chimeric TLR4/TLR7 ligand induced robust antitumor response in a syngeneic mouse B16F10 tumor model. These results demonstrate the profound effects that conjugation can have on immune response and support the use of conjugated PRR ligands as adjuvants/immunotherapeutics.

ONE SENTENCE SUMMARYConjugated PRR ligands enhance immune activation, serve as potent adjuvants, and induce antitumor response in a mouse model.

"Recent work on insight and information processing suggested feelings of aha as a metacognitive feedback signal. A series of processes, from curiosity (drive state) to insight (uncertainty reduction) to pleasure (reward and reinforcement), might represent a fundamental epistemic arc for motivated learning. Here, we present a paradigm that combines measurement of curiosity, insight (aha), under-standing and liking to outline the contours of this epistemic arc and study their neuronal mechanisms. In two preregistered experiments we employ the so called ""title effect"" - the fact that additional semantic information accompanying an artwork (such as titles) can change how an observer un-derstands and enjoys a piece of visual art. Participants viewed paintings (5s trials) and rated their curiosity for seeing the title. This was followed either by the original title or a dummy title lacking additional information (untitled), and a second presentation of the painting, after which participants rated strength of aha, aesthetic liking, and feeling of understanding the artwork.

In a behavioral online study (N=55 participants) we replicate a set of previous findings and estab-lished that visual art together with their titles can prompt strong feelings of aha. The association between the collected ratings is complex, partly nonlinear, and shaped by the type and amount of in-formation provided by the stimulus material. In an EEG, ECG and eye tracking study with the same paradigm (N=49 participants) we aimed to characterize the temporal sequence of processing. Using a time-resolved decoding approach we were able to recover the categorical experimental conditions and the graded ratings: curiosity for the title could be decoded late in pretitle trials and early in the posttitle trials; aha could be decoded in posttitle trials; felt understanding had the most robust sig-nature among the ratings and could be decoded from multiple signals in both pre and posttitle trials. Lastly, ratings of aesthetic liking were hard to decode from the data with only a short significant timewindow early during posttitle trials."
"Pattern-forming stochastic systems arise throughout biology, with dynamic molecular waves observed in biochemical networks regulating critical cellular processes. Modeling these reaction-diffusion systems using handcrafted stochastic partial differential equations (PDEs) requires extensive trial-and-error tuning. Data-driven approaches for improved modeling are needed but have been hindered by data scarcity and noise. Here, we present a solution to the inverse problem of learning stochastic reaction-diffusion models from limited data by optimizing two spatiotemporal features: (1) stochastic dynamics and (2) spatiotemporal patterns. Combined with sparsity enforcement, this method identifies novel activator-inhibitor models with interpretable structure. We demonstrate robust learning from simulations of excitable systems with varying data scarcity, as well as noisy live-cell imaging data with low temporal resolution and a single observed biomolecule. This generalizable approach to learning governing stochastic PDEs enhances our ability to model and understand complex spatiotemporal systems from limited, real-world data.

TeaserThis machine learning approach estimates stochastic PDE models using noisy, scarce data from simulations and live-cell imaging."
"Visual working memory is a core cognitive function that allows active storage of task-relevant visual information. While previous studies have postulated that the capacity of this system is fixed with respect to a single feature dimension, recent research has shown that working memory performance for a simple visual feature - color - is improved when this feature is encoded as part of a real-world object relative to an unrecognizable scrambled shape. Using EEG (N = 24), we here demonstrate that this performance increase is supported by enhanced neural delay activity during the retention period (indexed by the contralateral-delay-activity of the eventrelated potential), suggesting that the behavioral benefit is linked to the active maintenance process of working memory. Furthermore, using time-resolved neural similarity measures, we show that the neural activity is not only increased during the delay, but also more stable over time when colors are remembered as part of real-world objects. Finally, we report a novel frontocentral event-related potential that distinguishes between real-world objects and scrambled objects during encoding and maintenance processes. Overall, our results demonstrate that active visual working memory capacity for simple features is not fixed but can expand depending on what context these features are encoded in."
"Limbs execute diverse actions coordinated by the nervous system through multiple motor programs. The basic architecture of motor neurons that activate muscles which articulate joints for antagonistic flexion and extension movements is conserved from flies to vertebrates. While excitatory premotor circuits are expected to establish sets of leg motor neurons that work together, our study uncovered an instructive role for inhibitory circuits -- including their ability to generate rhythmic leg movements. Using electron microscopy data in the Drosophila nerve cord, we categorized [~]120 GABAergic inhibitory neurons from the 13A and 13B hemilineages into classes based on similarities in morphology and connectivity. By mapping their connections, we uncovered pathways for inhibiting specific groups of motor neurons, disinhibiting antagonistic counterparts, and inducing alternation between flexion and extension. We tested the function of specific inhibitory neurons through optogenetic activation and silencing, using high resolution quantitative analysis of leg movements during grooming. We combined findings from anatomical and behavioral analyses to construct a computational model that can reproduce major aspects of the observed behavior, confirming sufficiency of these premotor inhibitory circuits to generate rhythms.

"The rice genome underpins fundamental research and breeding, but the Nipponbare (japonica) reference does not fully encompass the genetic diversity of Asian rice. To address this gap, the Rice Population Reference Panel (RPRP) was developed, comprising high-quality assemblies of 16 rice cultivars to represent japonica, indica, aus, and aromatic varietal groups.

The RPRP has been consistently annotated, supported by extensive experimental data and here we report the computational assignment, characterization and dissemination of stably identified pan-genes. We identified 25,178 core pan-genes shared across all cultivars, alongside cultivar-specific and family-enriched genes. Core genes exhibit higher gene expression and proteomic evidence, higher confidence protein domains and AlphaFold structures, while cultivar-specific genes were enriched for domains under selective breeding pressure, such as for disease resistance. This resource, integrated into public databases, enables researchers to explore genetic and functional diversity via a population-aware ""reference guide"" across rice genomes, advancing both basic and applied research."
"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWHillieae is a group of [~]30 florally diverse, Neotropical epiphyte species. Species richness peaks in southern Central America and taxa display bat, hawkmoth, or hummingbird pollination syndromes. A phylogenetic framework is needed to understand floral and biogeographic evolution. We used target enrichment data to infer a species tree and a Bayesian time-calibrated tree including [~]83% of the species in the group. We inferred ancestral biogeography and pollination syndromes, described species realized bioclimatic niches via a principal component analysis, and estimated significant niche shifts using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models to understand how different abiotic and biotic variables have shaped Hillieae evolution. We estimated that Hillieae originated in southern Central America 19 Ma and that hawkmoth pollination is the ancestral character state. Multiple independent shifts in pollination syndrome, biogeographic distribution, and realized bioclimatic niche have occurred, though bioclimatic niche is largely conserved. Using generalized linear models, we identify two interactions-- between species biogeographic ranges and pollination syndromes, and between phylogenetic covariance and pollination syndromes-- that additively affect the degree of bioclimatic niche overlap between species. Regional variation in pollination syndrome diversity and patterns of species bioclimatic niche overlap indicate a link between biogeography and species ecology in driving Hillieae diversification and syndrome evolution."
"Real-world social cognition requires processing and adapting to multiple dynamic information streams. Interpreting neural activity in such ecological conditions remains a key challenge for neuroscience. This study leverages advancements in de-noising techniques and multivariate modeling to extract interpretable EEG signals from pairs of participants (male-male, female-female, and male-female) engaged in spontaneous dyadic dance. Using multivariate temporal response functions (mTRFs), we investigated how music acoustics, self-generated kinematics, other-generated kinematics, and social coordination uniquely contributed to EEG activity. Electromyogram recordings from ocular, face, and neck muscles were also modeled to control for artifacts. The mTRFs effectively disentangled neural signals associated with four processes: (I) auditory tracking of music, (II) control of self-generated movements, (III) visual monitoring of partner movements, and (IV) visual tracking of social coordination. We show that the first three neural signals are driven by event-related potentials: the P50-N100-P200 triggered by acoustic events, the central lateralized movement-related cortical potentials triggered by movement initiation, and the occipital N170 triggered by movement observation. Notably, the (previously unknown) neural marker of social coordination encodes the spatiotemporal alignment between dancers, surpassing the encoding of self-or partner-related kinematics taken alone. This marker emerges when partners can see each other, exhibits a topographical distribution over occipital areas, and is specifically driven by movement observation rather than initiation. Using data-driven kinematic decomposition, we further show that vertical bounce movements best drive observers EEG activity. These findings highlight the potential of real-world neuroimaging, combined with multivariate modeling, to uncover the mechanisms underlying complex yet natural social behaviors.

Significance statementReal-world brain function involves integrating multiple information streams simultaneously. However, due to a shortfall of computational methods, laboratory-based neuroscience often examines neural processes in isolation. Using multivariate modeling of EEG data from pairs of participants freely dancing to music, we demonstrate that it is possible to tease apart physiologically established neural processes associated with music perception, motor control, and observation of a partners movement. Crucially, we identify a previously unknown neural marker of social coordination that encodes the spatiotemporal alignment between dancers, beyond self- or partner-related kinematics alone. These findings highlight the potential of computational neuroscience to uncover the biological mechanisms underlying real-world social and motor behaviors, advancing our understanding of how the brain supports dynamic and interactive activities."
"The association of a sensory cue with an outcome is a crucial step in learning to identify safe versus threatening situations. Here we assessed how learned sound-safety association alters neuronal activity in tail of the striatum (TS), where auditory cortical and thalamic inputs converge. Prior to training, foot shock elicited responses by TS direct and indirect pathway spiny projection neurons (SPNs), while sound tones produced no response. However, once the sound association was learned, sound tones strongly activated TS SPNs, even when the animal was under anesthesia. This conditioned auditory response occurred concurrently with alterations of direct pathway SPNs in the TS, including increased responses to cortical and auditory thalamic inputs, increased excitatory response with an enhanced ratio of NMDA to AMPA receptors, decreased responses to inhibitory input, and increased dendritic spines. This convergence of postsynaptic changes provides responses to relevant auditory cues during associative learning.

TeaserSound-safety association enhances response to learned sound in striatal neurons via postsynaptic mechanisms"
"Ebola virus (EBOV), the causative agent of Ebola virus disease (EVD), remains one of WHOs top ten threats to global health. Infectious EBOV virions can be found on the surface of skin late during systemic infection and passed from the deceased through skin-to-skin contact. Here, we assess viral load and antigen expression in the skin of EBOV-infected non-human primates (NHP) and mouse adapted-EBOV (ma-EBOV) - infected mice and use the low containment viral model, rVSV/EBOV GP, to mechanistically define skin infection in mice. Viral RNA peaked within the skin proximal to the site of injection in EBOV-infected NHPs on day 6. In contrast, mouse skin sites distal to the site of ma-EBOV injection achieved maximal viral loads by day 3. At late times of infection, viral antigen-positive cells co-localized with markers for endothelial, stromal, and immune cells in the dermis. Epidermal cells within and surrounding hair follicles also harbored viral antigen, suggesting a potential mechanism of virus trafficking to the epidermal surface. Despite robust viral infection, distal skin sites of ma-EBOV-infected mice had low expression of proinflammatory stimulated genes. A similar cellular tropism was observed in the skin of mice infected with rVSV/EBOV GP, with discrete focal areas of intense infection. When virus was applied to the surface of gently abraded skin to remove the stratum corneum, epidermal keratinocytes were robustly infected, followed by systemic viral dissemination. To define cell surface receptors critical for virus trafficking to and replication within the skin, mice lacking the phosphatidylserine receptors were infected intraperitoneally with rVSV/EBOV GP. At day 3 of infection, skin distal to the site of infection of TIM-1 knock out (KO) mice had significantly lower levels of infectious virus than the control mice, suggesting that TIM-1 is essential for efficient distribution of virus to the skin. Our findings reveal that EBOV targets specific skin cell populations at late times of viral infection and that the host receptor TIM-1 is required for optimal viral dissemination."
"Attaching and effacing pathogens, such as enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli, rely on an adhesin, intimin, for attachment to enterocytes and downstream effects leading to actin pedestal formation. Intimin belongs to the inverse autotransporter family (type 5e secretion systems), which secrete the extracellular adhesive domain or passenger via a hairpin intermediate. While many of the next steps in secretion are now understood, how the hairpin initially forms is not known. We sought to investigate this by making point mutations at several positions in the {beta}-barrel domain of intimin, as this domain forms at least part of the secretion pore. We made the mutations in a wild-type background and in a stalled intermediate caught in the hairpin conformation, which allowed us to uncouple passenger secretion from hairpin formation. Surprisingly, most of the point mutations did not have an appreciable effect on hairpin formation or passenger secretion, and larger changes such as replacing the entire linker region with a flexible glycine-serine stretch showed only a modest reduction in passenger secretion. By contrast, mutations affecting a small {beta}-sheet at the extracellular face of the intimin {beta}-barrel between two extracellular loops and the C-terminus of the linker had a more pronounced effect on secretion, and abolishing this {beta}-sheet prevented hairpin formation and led to complete loss of the wild-type protein. Our results show that the intimin {beta}-barrel is remarkably tolerant to changes and that the {beta}-sheet on the extracellular side of this domain plays a central role in passenger secretion and protein stability."
"Nanopore sensing, a high-resolution DNA sequencing technology, is fast expanding into novel and exciting direction of probing specific DNA-enzyme interactions. Although proven excellent for detection of structural features of bare DNA, quantitative measurements on enzyme-DNA complexes and its real-time activity are lagging and only starting to emerge for long DNA templates. Signal-to-noise requirement and high translocation speeds make it difficult to detect protein bound on biologically relevant plasmid length DNA. To this end we report accurate position detection of a catalytically active Cas9 bound to its single or multiple target sites on the DNA. Protein position is fingerprinted using event charge deficit (ECD) based analysis of the high signal-to-noise electrical signals as the complex translocates through a glass nanopore. Using a time dependent assay, we quantify kinetics of the released products upon enzymatic cleavage of the target DNA by the wild-type Cas9 nuclease. Our approach enables the nanopore based single molecule sensing of DNA-protein complexes, for real-time monitoring of biochemical reactions. This may help understand protein binding & localization as well as improve Cas9 based targeting in genome engineering applications.

"Adaptive populations rarely evolve in a static environment. Therefore, understanding and ultimately controlling the evolution of a population requires consideration of fluctuating selective pressures. The fitness landscape metaphor has long been used as a tool for representing the selective pressures a given environment imposes on a population. Much work has already been done to understand the dynamics of evolution on a single fitness landscape. More recently, evolution on fluctuating or sequentially applied landscapes has come to the fore of evolutionary biology. As more empirical landscapes are described, metrics for describing salient features of paired landscapes will have uses for understanding likely evolutionary dynamics. Currently, Pearson correlation coefficient and collateral sensitivity likelihoods are used to quantify topographical relatedness or dissimilarity of a pair of landscapes. Here, we introduce the edge flip fraction, a new metric for comparing landscapes, which quantifies changes in the directionality of evolution between pairs of fitness landscapes. We demonstrate that the edge flip fraction captures topographical differences in landscapes that traditional metrics may overlook which have important consequences for the trajectories of populations evolving on them. By applying this metric to both empirical and synthetic fitness landscapes, we show that it partially predicts the collateral sensitivity likelihoods and can inform the optimality of drug sequences. We show that optimal drug sequences that keep populations within lower fitness regions require shifts in evolutionary directions, which are quantified by the edge flip fraction. Edge flip fraction complements existing measures and may help researchers understand how populations evolve under changing environmental conditions, and could yield clues in the pursuit of evolutionary control."
"Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterised by persistent depressed mood and loss of interest and pleasure in life, known as anhedonia. The first line of treatment for MDD is antidepressant medication that enhances signaling by monoamine neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine. Other treatments include non-pharmaceutical treatments, such as electroconvulsive therapy and transmagnetic stimulation, and non-traditional pharmaceutical antidepressants that function via alternative, often unknown, mechanisms. Methods: To identify mechanisms of action shared across antidepressant categories, we examined changes in gene expression following treatment with both traditional and non-traditional antidepressants, using a meta-analysis of public transcriptional profiling data from laboratory rodents (rats, mice). We focused on the hippocampus, which is a brain region that is well-documented via neuro-imaging to show morphological changes in depression that reverse with antidepressant usage. We specifically focused on treatment during adulthood, and included both clinically-used antidepressants (both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical) and treatments demonstrated to effectively treat depressive mood symptoms. The outcome variable was gene expression in bulk dissected hippocampus as measured by microarray or RNA-Seq. To conduct our project, we systematically reviewed available datasets in the Gemma database of curated, reprocessed transcriptional profiling data using pre-defined search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria. We identified 15 relevant studies containing a total of 22 antidepressant vs. control group comparisons (collective n=352). For each gene, a random effects meta-analysis model was then fit to the antidepressant vs. control effect sizes (Log2 Fold Changes) extracted from each study. Results: Our meta-analysis yielded stable estimates for 16,439 genes, identifying 58 genes that were consistently differentially expressed (False Discovery Rate<0.05) across antidepressant experiments and categories. Of these genes, 23 were upregulated and 35 were downregulated. The functions associated with the differentially expressed genes were diverse, including modulation of the stress response, immune regulation, neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity. Conclusion: The genes that we identified as consistently differentially expressed across antidepressant categories may be worth investigating as potential linchpins for antidepressant efficacy or as targets for novel therapies."
"Boolean models are widely used for studying dynamic processes of biological systems. However, their inherent discrete nature limits their ability to capture continuous aspects of signal transduction, such as signal strength or protein activation levels. Although existing tools provide some path exploration capabilities that can be used to explore signal transduction circuits, the computational workload often requires simplifying assumptions that compromise the accuracy of the analysis. Here, we introduce BooLEVARD, a Python package designed to efficiently quantify the number of paths leading either to node activation or repression in Boolean models, which offers a more detailed and quantitative perspective on how molecular signals propagate through signaling networks. By focusing on the collection of non-redundant paths directly influencing Boolean outcomes, BooLEVARD enhances the precision of signal strength representation. We showcase the application of BooLEVARD in studying cell-fate decisions using a Boolean model of cancer metastasis, demonstrating its ability to identify critical signaling events. Furthermore, BooLEVARD provides a refined understanding of signaling dynamics, which can increase our understanding of disease development and drug responses. BooLEVARD is freely available at https://github.com/farinasm/boolevard."
"Analyses of brain sizes across mammalian taxonomic groups reveal a consistent pattern of covariation between major brain components, including a robust inverse covariation between the limbic system and the neocortex. To find the functional basis of this inverse relationship, we mapped the multidimensional representations of task-optimized machine learning systems onto two-dimensional surfaces resembling the forebrain cortices. We found that visual, somatosensory and auditory systems develop ordered spatiotopic maps where units draw information from localized regions of the sensory input. Olfactory and relational memory systems, in contrast, develop fractured maps with distributed patterns of information convergence. Evolutionary optimization of multimodal systems for varying task objectives results in inverse covariation between spatiotopic and disordered system components that compete for representational space. These results suggest that the observed pattern of covariation between brain components reflect an essential computational duality in brain evolution."
"The HIV-1 capsid, which orchestrates several key post-entry events to facilitate infection in target cells, is composed of hexamers and pentamers (capsomers) of the capsid (CA) protein arranged in a closed, conical structure known as the capsid that protects the viral RNA genome and replicative enzymes reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN). Each capsomer contains a central pore lined with rings of positively charged amino acid side chains - Arg-18 (R18) and Lys-25 (K25). The R18 and K25 rings drive capsid assembly by binding the host polyanion inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) and are proposed to mediate the import of dNTPs into the capsid to facilitate reverse transcription. Here we demonstrate that the R18 ring can be functionally replaced by the introduction of a mutation (N21K) that establishes a new electropositive ring within the central pore. In contrast with previous studies in which R18 mutants were unable to adapt in culture, the N21K mutation facilitated the acquisition of second-site compensatory mutations that restored near-WT fitness to viral mutants lacking the R18 ring. Comparative analysis of several central pore mutants lacking the R18 ring revealed that particle infectivity was not correlated with IP6 binding or capsid assembly, but rather with capsid stability and key post-entry events including reverse transcription and nuclear entry. Our results indicate that the central pore plays critical roles in both the assembly of capsids and their sustained stability post-entry."
"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important nosocomial pathogen which can cause serious infections across diverse anatomic locations. Infections can spread within an individual to different body sites, but the rate and directionality of this process is unknown. We explored within-host diversity as well as the body site translocation dynamics using de-convoluted metagenomic P. aeruginosa reads from 256 hospital patients sampled at both respiratory and gut sites. Of the 84 patients where P. aeruginosa genomes could be recovered, there were 27 cases where the same P. aeruginosa clone was detected across multiple body sites. Using a simulation approach, we found that the majority of body site sharing was likely due to within-patient translocation of clones rather than independent acquisition from the hospital environment. Using ancestral reconstruction, we predicted that most clones likely occupied a respiratory niche, and that the probable direction of clone transmission was lung-to-gut. We detected within-patient variation and noted a strong enrichment of mutations in genes associated with antimicrobial resistance, irrespective of sample type. There was significantly more translocation than has been previously reported and highlight that lower respiratory tract infections can result in persistent gut colonisation of P. aeruginosa, a major risk factor for sepsis in vulnerable hosts."
"Activating immune receptors provide mechanisms for phagocytes to elicit important effector functions that promote the killing of microbes. Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor A5 (LILRA5) an orphan immune receptor expressed by human phagocytes and co-localising with FcR{gamma}, remains poorly characterised. To address this, we developed a highly-specific anti-LILRA5 monoclonal antibody that has agonistic properties. Using a specific anti-LILRA5 antibody, we show LILRA5 expression on naive monocytes and neutrophils, and that ligation of LILRA5 stimulates ROS production. While increased LILRA5 transcript copy numbers have been associated with sepsis, we also observed increased levels in patients with systemic infection but without sepsis complications. Ex vivo bacterial infection of whole blood did not alter surface LILRA5 expression, but LPS stimulation changed expression levels. This indicates that surface LILRA5 expression is dynamic and likely regulated posttranscriptionally, changing responses to different stimuli or over time. Soluble (s)LILRA5 was enhanced in sera from sepsis patients and in supernatants of monocytes that were LPS-stimulated, indicative that shedding of LILRA5 from cell surfaces or that expression of sLILRA5 isoforms provides a mechanism to regulate surface LILRA5 expression levels. Finally, we show that altered surface LILRA5 expression influences LILRA5-induced ROS production capacity. We propose that LILRA5 is a dynamically regulated activating receptor expressed on phagocytes that can stimulate ROS production."
"Agriculture driven land-use change is a major contributor to insect declines globally. As a result of population decline and subdivision, species lose genetic diversity, potentially reducing adaptive potential and increasing genetic load, reinforcing decline. We examine how genetic diversity has changed over the past century in three Polyommatinae butterfly species in Sweden, leveraging genome sequencing of specimens from museum collections. Based on 59 historical and 90 contemporary genomes, we document a 6% decline in genetic diversity in the strongly grassland associated Cyaniris semiargus, driven by increased population isolation. In contrast, generalist Polyommatus icarus and heathland specialist Plebejus argus have largely maintained genetic diversity and connectivity over the study period. The reduction in heterozygosity in Cy. semiargus results from increases in runs of homozygosity. Thus, loss of functional connectivity has led to inbreeding in Cy. semiargus, exposing greater proportions of weakly deleterious mutations and variants in highly conserved regions, in homozygous states. This realized burden likely reduces mean fitness and reinforces population decline, highlighting the need for well-connected grassland landscapes to maintain grassland specialist functional connectivity and genetic diversity. We complement these analyses with five additional Polyommatinae species, uncovering that warning- and alarm rates of decline are found in three of those, including in Cy. semiargus, currently listed as of least concern. This study highlights the necessity of incorporating genetic data into conservation planning, as threats from genetic erosion are not captured by census-based conservation assessments."
"Transposons, or ""jumping genes,"" are mobile genetic elements that reshape genomes. The Tc1/Mariner family, including Tc3a transposase, has been studied for decades, but key aspects of its DNA recognition and cleavage remain unresolved. Existing models propose a homo-dimeric process for DNA excision and integration, yet conflicting hypotheses exist about the initial steps of DNA cleavage and target site recognition. Here, we reveal a previously unrecognized base-flipping mechanism in Tc3a transposase that challenges long-standing models of Mariner transposon activity. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that N-terminal acetylation induces a structural shift in the transposase-DNA complex, forcing a nucleotide in the inverted repeat to flip outward. This base-flipping event alters the local DNA conformation, creating torsional strain that may facilitate transposon inverted terminal repeat association. Unlike prior models, which assumed the entire protein, or protein dimers, were needed to illicit DNA interactions necessary for any types of torsion, our findings indicate that transposase bipartite binding itself actively reshapes DNA structure. We further show that this mechanism is dependent on the bipartite helix-turn-helix domains, which differentially contribute to DNA stabilization and recognition. Our simulations also reveal that the processed N-terminus plays an unexpected role in modulating DNA binding affinity, contradicting previous assumptions that it was structurally inconsequential. Together, the two helix-turn-helix motifs act to propagate the force caused by base flipping along one direction of the cognate DNA double helix axis. The fact that previous structural studies lacked this amino acid modification may explain why this mechanism was overlooked. These results provide a new framework for understanding transposase-DNA interactions, highlighting how a single molecular modification can trigger major DNA rearrangements. This discovery not only redefines the Tc3a transposition process but also calls for a reassessment of long-standing Mariner family transposon models."
"O_LIChanges in land use and climate change threaten global biodiversity and ecosystems, calling for the urgent development of effective conservation strategies. Recognizing landscape heterogeneity, which refers to the variation in natural features within an area, is crucial for these strategies. While remote sensing images quantify landscape heterogeneity, they might fail to detect ecological patterns in moderately disturbed areas, particularly at minor spatial scales. This is partly because satellite imagery may not effectively capture undergrowth conditions due to its resolution constraints. In contrast, soundscape analysis, which studies environmental acoustic signals, emerges as a novel tool for understanding ecological patterns, providing reliable information on habitat conditions and landscape heterogeneity in complex environments across diverse scales and serving as a complement to remote sensing methods.
C_LIO_LIWe propose an unsupervised approach using passive acoustic monitoring data and network inference methods to analyze acoustic heterogeneity patterns based on biophony composition. This method uses sonotypes, unique acoustic entities characterized by their specific time-frequency spaces, to establish the acoustic structure of a site through sonotype occurrences, focusing on general biophony rather than specific species and providing information on the acoustic footprint of a site. From a sonotype composition matrix, we use the Graphical Lasso method, a sparse Gaussian graphical model, to identify acoustic similarities across sites, map ecological complexity relationships through the nodes (sites) and edges (similarities), and transform acoustic data into a graphical representation of ecological interactions and landscape acoustic diversity.
C_LIO_LIWe implemented the proposed method across 17 sites within an oil palm plantation in Santander, Colombia. The resulting inferred graphs visualize the acoustic similarities among sites, reflecting the biophony achieved by characterizing the landscape through its acoustic structures. Correlating our findings with ecological metrics like the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index and satellite imagery indices reveals significant insights into landscape heterogeneity.
C_LIO_LIThis unsupervised approach offers a new perspective on understanding ecological and biological interactions and advances soundscape analysis. The soundscape decomposition into sonotypes underscores the methods advantage, offering the possibility to associate sonotypes with species and identify their contribution to the similarity proposed by the graph.

"Brain activity unfolds over hierarchical timescales that reflect how brain regions integrate and process information, linking functional and structural organization. While timescale studies are prevalent, existing estimation methods rely on the restrictive assumption of exponentially decaying autocorrelation and only provide point estimates without standard errors, limiting statistical inference. In this paper, we formalize and evaluate two methods for mapping timescales in resting-state fMRI: a time-domain fit of an autoregressive (AR1) model and an autocorrelation-domain fit of an exponential decay model. Rather than assuming exponential autocorrelation decay, we define timescales by projecting the fMRI time series onto these approximating models, requiring only stationarity and mixing conditions while incorporating robust standard errors to account for model misspecification. We introduce theoretical properties of timescale estimators and show parameter recovery in realistic simulations, as well as applications to fMRI from the Human Connectome Project. Comparatively, the time-domain method produces more accurate estimates under model misspecification, remains computationally efficient for high-dimensional fMRI data, and yields maps aligned with known functional brain organization. In this work we show valid statistical inference on fMRI timescale maps, and provide Python implementations of all methods."
"Transcription Factors (TFs) are essential regulatory proteins that control the cellular transcriptional states by binding to specific DNA sequences known as Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs) or motifs. Accurate TFBS identification is crucial for unraveling regulatory mechanisms driving cellular dynamics. Over the years, various computational approaches have been developed to model TFBSs, with Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) being one of the most widely adopted methods. PWMs provide a probabilistic framework by representing nucleotide frequencies at every position within the binding site. While effective and interpretable, PWMs face significant limitations, such as their inability to capture positional dependencies or model complex interactions. To address these, advanced methods, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based models, have been introduced. Leveraging human ChIP-seq data from ENCODE, this study systematically benchmarks the predictive performance of PWM and SVM-based models across different scenarios. We evaluate the impact of key factors such as training dataset size, sequence length, and kernel functions (for SVMs) on models performance. Additionally, we explore the impact of synthetic versus real biological background data during model training. Our analysis highlights strengths and limitations of both PWM and SVM-based approaches under different conditions, providing practical guidance for selecting and tailoring models to specific biological datasets. To complement our analysis, we present a comprehensive database of pretrained SVM models for TFBS detection, trained on human ChIP-seq data from diverse cell lines and tissues. This resource aims to facilitate broader adoption of SVM-based methods in TFBS prediction and enhance their practical utility in regulatory genomics research."
"Animals with small nervous systems have a limited number of sensory neurons that must encode information from a changing environment. This problem is particularly exacerbated in nematodes that populate a wide variety of distinct ecological niches but only have a few sensory neurons available to encode multiple modalities. How does sensory diversity prevail within this constraint in neuron number? To identify the genetic basis for patterning different nervous systems, we demonstrate that sensory neurons in Pristionchus pacificus respond to various salt sensory cues in a manner that is partially distinct from that of the distantly related nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. By visualizing neuronal activity patterns, we show that contrary to previous expectations based on its genome sequence, the salt responses of P. pacificus are encoded in a left/right asymmetric manner in the bilateral ASE neuron pair. Our study illustrates patterns of evolutionary stability and change in the gustatory system of nematodes.

Animals with small nervous systems have evolved left and right asymmetry in their neurons to process various salts at different concentrations."
"Our desktop application MBCO PathNet allows for quick and easy integration and visualization of networks of functionally related pathways predicted from numerous gene and protein lists using the Molecular Biology of the Cell Ontology (MBCO) and other ontologies. Within networks of hierarchical parent-child relationships or functional relationships, pathways are visualized as pie charts where each slice represents a dataset that predicted that pathway. Sizes of pies and slices can be selected to represent statistical significance or other quantitative measures. In addition, MBCO PathNet can generate bar diagrams, heatmaps and timelines.

"The basic Helix-Loop-Helix-Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH-PAS) transcription factors (TFs) are regulators of several critical cellular functions such as circadian rhythm, hypoxia response and neuronal development. These proteins contain tandemly repeated PAS domains that mediate heterodimer formation. While PAS domains adopt a conserved fold, recent studies suggest that their interaction interfaces differ distinctly in different TF complexes. However, the implications of these differences on the intrinsic dynamics of PAS domains remain unclear. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of PAS domain dynamics across multiple bHLH-PAS TF complexes using all-atom Elastic Network Models (ENMs) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We decomposed the intrinsic dynamics of PAS domains into self-coupled (internal domain dynamics) and directly coupled (interaction partner-influenced dynamics) motions using a projection-based approach. Our results show that self-coupled motions are more conserved across PAS domains than structure or sequence alone, while directly coupled motions capture the context-specific influence of partner proteins. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering of the overall covariance-based similarity scores revealed distinct grouping of CLOCK:BMAL1-type and HIF:ARNT-type complexes, which were not captured by sequence or structural comparisons. Root mean square fluctuation profiles derived from both MD and ENM approaches showed strong correspondence, validating the utility of ENMs in capturing biologically relevant dynamics, even in cases where the structural complexes were modelled using AlphaFold3. PAS-B domains were generally found to be less flexible than PAS-A domains for all the complexes analysed. Regions with high directly coupled flexibility were generally localized regions with high interface propensity in class I PAS-B domains, suggesting a higher level of coupled dynamics between PAS-B domains. Our results highlight how PAS domain intrinsic dynamics are shaped by both their internal architecture and complex-specific interactions, offering new insights into the functional diversification of bHLH-PAS transcription factors.

Statement of SignificancePAS domains are ubiquitous across all domains of life with diverse functions attributed to them. As part of bHLH-PAS transcription factors (TFs), they enable dimerization of Class I and Class II TFs. In this work, we investigated the effect of dimerization of PAS domains on their flexibility by using a method that allows us to isolate the intrinsic dynamics internal to a target domain and the intrinsic dynamics linked to the crosstalk between domains, from the all-atom elastic network model-based normal modes of the whole TF complex. Our findings reveal a context specific conservation of intrinsic dynamics based on the type of heterodimer complex. We also find a strong agreement between more-detailed MD simulations and the coarse-grained method used."
"Recent experiments have shown that the diffusion coefficient of some metabolic enzymes increases with the concentration of their cognate substrate, a phenomenon known as enhanced diffusion. In the presence of substrate gradients, enhanced diffusion induces enzymatic drift, resulting in a non-homogeneous enzyme distribution. Here, we study the effects of enhanced diffusion on enzyme-loaded vesicles placed in external substrate gradients using a combination of computer simulations and analytical modeling. We observe that the spatially inhomogeneous enzyme profiles generated by enhanced diffusion result in a pressure gradient across the vesicle, which leads to macroscopically observable effects, such as deformation and self-propulsion of the vesicle. Our analytical model allows us to characterize dependence of the velocity of propulsion on experimentally tunable parameters. The effects predicted by our work provide an avenue for further validation of enhanced diffusion, and might be leveraged for the design of novel synthetic cargo transporters, such as targeted drug delivery systems."
"A large number of biomedical computational tools have spawned several tool registries. However, in the face of the rapid growth in the number of tools, existing tool registries, which are manually curated or community-driven, are difficult to keep up to date, resulting in inadequate tool repository data. In this paper, we show that language models (LMs) can aid in building a community of tools. We introduce BioMedTools (https://biomed.tools), a community of biomedical computational tools that mainly implements LM-based tool identification and a chat assistant. Compared with existing tool registries, BioMedTools achieves excellence in terms of the number of tools, frequency of data updates, and functionality. Meanwhile, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers hub in BioMedTools may promote the building of agents in the biomedical field. BioMedTools enables the efficient collection of tools and enhances their findability and accessibility."
"The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Gemini, and LLaMA, have opened new avenues for computational biology and bioinformatics. We report the development of BioLLMBench, a novel framework designed to evaluate LLMs in bioinformatics tasks. This study assessed GPT-4, Gemini, and LLaMA through 2,160 experimental runs, focusing on 24 distinct tasks across six key areas: domain expertise, mathematical problem-solving, coding proficiency, data visualization, research paper summarization, and machine learning model development. Tasks ranged from fundamental to expert-level challenges, and each area was evaluated using seven specific metrics. A Contextual Response Variability Analysis was implemented to understand how model responses varied under different conditions. Results showed diverse performance: GPT-4 led in most tasks, achieving a 91.3% proficiency in domain knowledge, while Gemini excelled in mathematical problem-solving with a 97.5% proficiency score. GPT-4 also outperformed in machine learning model development, though Gemini and LLaMA struggled to generate executable code. All models faced challenges in research paper summarization, scoring below 40% using the ROUGE metric. Model performance variance increased when using a new chat window, though average scores remained similar. The study also discusses the limitations and potential misuse risks of these models in bioinformatics."
"SummaryRobust estimation with convexity constraints significantly improves signal fitting for in vivo human cardiac diffusion kurtosis imaging.

PurposeCardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) is an emerging technique to investigate the microstructure of heart tissue. At sufficiently high b-values, additional information on microstructure can be observed, but the data require a representation beyond DTI such as diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). cDTI is highly prone to image corruption, which researchers usually attempt to handle with shot-rejection. However, this can be handled more generally with robust estimation techniques. Recent work has also demonstrated the need to perform constrained fitting for DKI, as fitted parameters can otherwise violate necessary constraints on the signal behaviour, causing significant errors in estimated measures.

MethodsWe developed robust constrained weighted least squares (RCWLS) by combining robust estimation with convexity constraints specifically for DKI. Using in vivo cardiac DKI data from 11 healthy volunteers collected with a Connectom scanner, we tested various combinations of fitting techniques, with/without robustness and with/without constraints.

ResultsRCWLS was the only tested technique that convincingly showed radial kurtosis to be larger than axial kurtosis for all subjects, something that is expected in myocardium due to increased restrictions to diffusion in the plane perpendicular to the primary myocyte direction. RCWLS also showed the best correction of corrupted regions in diffusion parameter maps for individual subjects.

ConclusionFitting techniques utilizing both robust estimation and constraints are essential to facilitate applicability of in vivo cardiac DKI."
"The mammalian vestibular system has two types of sensory receptor hair cells (HCs), each with different neurotransmission mechanisms. Type II HCs use ribbon synapses to transmit neurotransmitters like glutamate to afferent neurons. On the other hand, type I HCs are nearly engulfed by a calyceal afferent ending and also form ribbon synapses. These HCs regulate afferent activity through non-quantal transmission (NQT), which is faster than classic neurotransmitter release and may play a key role in stabilizing vision and balance during rapid head movements. Here, we describe a novel striated contact, present between the mouse type I HC and its calyceal afferent ending, and intimately associated with atypical plasma membrane-apposed (PMA) mitochondria. This distinctive arrangement has the potential to serve or modulate NQT."
"Flatfish metamorphosis is characterized by extensive tissue remodeling, associated with a transition from pelagic to benthic lifestyle, being the migration of one eye the most dramatic change. Epigenetic mechanisms exert a pivotal role in developmental programs. This study investigates the DNA methylation profiles of migrating and non-migrating eyes using reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) during three developmental stages of turbot: pre-metamorphosis, climax and post-metamorphosis. Over 31% of all identified regions were hypermethylated during climax stage in both eyes, coinciding with elevated expression of the dnmt3a gene, responsible for de novo methylation. Additionally, transcription factors crucial for retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) development, including the eomesa and tbr1b, exhibited differential methylation and expression between the migrating and non-migrating eye during the climax phase. These findings underscore the significance of DNA methylation in the intricate remodeling of the visual system during turbot metamorphosis, particularly regarding RGC-mediated ocular migration and the transmission of visual signals."
"Cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) ion channels are vital for cellular signaling and excitability, with activation regulated by cyclic adenosine-or guanosine-monophosphate (cAMP, cGMP) binding. However, the allosteric mechanisms underlying this activation, particularly the energetics that describe conformational changes within individual domains and between domains, remain unclear. The prokaryotic CNBD channel SthK has been a useful model for better understanding these allosteric mechanisms. Here, we applied time-resolved transition metal ion Forster resonance energy transfer (tmFRET) to investigate the conformational dynamics and energetics in the CNBD of SthK in both a soluble C-terminal fragment of the protein, SthKCterm, and in the full-length channel, SthKFull. We incorporated the noncanonical amino acid Acd as a FRET donor and a metal bound to a chelator conjugated to a cysteine as an acceptor. We used time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) to measure time-resolved FRET and fit the TCSPC data to obtain donor-acceptor distance distributions in the absence and presence of cAMP. The distance distributions allowed us to quantify the energetics of coupling between the C-terminal domains and the transmembrane domains by comparing the donor-acceptor distance distributions for SthKCterm and SthKFull. Our data indicate that the presence of the SthK transmembrane domains makes the activating conformational change in the CNBD more favorable. These findings highlight the power of time-resolved tmFRET to uncover the structural and energetic landscapes of allosteric proteins and of the ligand-mediated mechanism in CNBD channels specifically."
"The serotonin-2A receptor (5-HT2AR) is an interesting target for drug design in the context of antidepressants that might have a rapid onset of action and/or be effective in treatment-resistant cases. The main challenge, however, is that the activation of this receptor can provoke hallucinations. Recent studies have shown that activating the receptor with certain (partial) agonists could potentially give rise to antidepressant effect without hallucinogenic side effects. Although substantial research has been done in this area, the atomistic details of this differential activation of the serotonin-2A receptor are not fully understood. In the present study we performed multiple atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 5-HT2AR bound with an antipsychotic, two different potential non-hallucinogenic antidepressants and a hallucinogen to identify the receptors ligand dependent conformations. Overall, our findings suggest that modest 5-HT2AR activation would only yield antidepressant effects and hallucinations result from excessive activation. While modest activation through microdosing may be problematic on account of abuse potential as well as possibly narrow and patient-dependent therapeutic windows, modest activation through administration of a sufficiently weak partial agonist may offer a viable drug development pathway.

Author SummaryActivating the serotonin-2A receptor (5-HT2AR) with specific agonists is a promising strategy for the development of a new class of antidepressants. However, potent agonists such as LSD, DMT or psylocibin generally cause hallucinations. To aid the development of 5-HT2AR-targeted antidepressants that do not cause this side effect, we seek to gain a better understanding of the receptor by studying its activation mechanism. Specifically, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to explore how different drugs interact with 5-HT2AR, both in the absence and presence of an intracellular binding partner. This led to the identification of tentative intermediate states along the activation pathway, which could be linked to the ligands pharmacological properties. Our findings suggest that hallucinogens cause an excessive build-up of activated receptors, whereas carefully designed mild activators could lead to a new generation of antidepressants that do not induce hallucinations."
"Shellfish producers have proposed using depuration systems to reduce Vibrio parahaemolyticus levels by supporting the oysters natural purging ability. For commercial viability, depuration efficacy must be validated in relevant species and at scale using appropriate conditions, including time and temperature. This study aims to I) compare depuration efficacy across oyster species, II) assess non-pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus as a surrogate, and III) optimize pilot-scale depuration to identify process variables likely to achieve >3.0-log reduction of V. parahaemolyticus at commercial-scale.

Three oyster species (Crassostrea gigas, Crassostrea sikamea, Crassostrea virginica) were exposed to artificial seawater (35 ppt) containing five non-pathogenic or five pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus strains. Inoculated oysters were placed in a pilot-scale recirculating depuration system at 5, 11, or 13 {degrees}C for 7 days. Three replicate depuration trials were conducted, sampling five oysters per species and the two different bacterial inoculations every 24 hours. V. parahaemolyticus in oyster tissue was enumerated using serial dilutions and spread plating techniques on Thiosulfate-Citrate-Bile Salts-Sucrose agar.

In C. gigas and C. sikamea, inoculation achieved at least a 5 log CFU/g V. parahaemolyticus, but C. virginica did not consistently reach target density within 24 hours. Accumulation of non-pathogenic and pathogenic strains was similar across species. Depuration at 11{degrees}C achieved a >3 log CFU/mL reduction of the pathogenic strain combination in C. gigas and C. sikamea tissues within five days, while C. virginica averaged 2.8 log CFU/mL. V. parahaemolyticus clearance rate was rapid during the first 24-48 hours of depuration. The non-pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus strain combination was reduced at a comparable or slower rate than the pathogenic combination, supporting its suitability as a surrogate for commercial validations. These findings support depuration as an effective V. parahaemolyticus mitigation strategy in live oysters; though optimization of parameters, including temperature and duration, is needed to meet reduction targets in all species."
"Iron (Fe) deficiency is a limiting factor for legumes, yet the role of beneficial fungi in mitigating Fe deficiency in garden pea is understudied. In this study, Trichoderma afroharzianum T22 colonized the roots of garden pea cultivars exposed to alkaline-exposed Fe-deficiency in a host-specific manner. In Fe-deficient Sugar Snap, T22 improved growth parameters, consistent with increased tissue mineral content, particularly Fe and Mn, as well as enhanced rhizosphere siderophore levels. The split-root assay demonstrated that the beneficial effects of T22 on Fe deficiency mitigation are the result of a whole-plant association rather than localized root-specific effects. RNA-seq analysis showed 575 and 818 differentially expressed genes upregulated and downregulated in the roots inoculated with T22 under Fe deficiency. The upregulated genes were mostly involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (monooxygenase activity, ammonia-lyase activity, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase), along with genes related to mineral transport and redox homeostasis. Further, a flavonoid precursor restored plant health even in the absence of T22, confirming the role of microbial symbiosis in mitigating Fe deficiency. Interestingly, T22 restored the abundance of rhizobia, particularly Rhizobium leguminosarum and Rhizobium indicum, along with the induction of NifA, NifD, and NifH in nodules, suggesting a connection between T22 and rhizobia under Fe-starvation. Further, the elevated rhizosphere siderophore, root flavonoid, expression of PsCoA (4-coumarate-CoA ligase) as well as the relative abundance of TaAOX1 and R. leguminosarum diminished when T22 was substituted with exogenous Fe. This suggests that exogenous Fe eliminates the need for microbiome-driven Fe mobilization, while T22-mediated Fe mitigation depends on flavonoid-driven symbiosis and R. leguminosarum abundance. It was further supported by the positive interaction of T22 on R. leguminosarum growth in Fe-deficient media. Thus, the beneficial effect of T22 on rhizobia likely stems from their interactions, not just improved Fe status in plants. This study provides the first mechanistic insights into T22 interactions with host and rhizobia, advancing microbiome strategies to alleviate Fe deficiency in peas and other legumes."
"We report the development of REMEDY (REpair of heterozygous Mutations independent of Exogenous Donor template with high efficiencY), a genome editing strategy that allows efficient repair of heterozygous mutations in human and mouse cells without necessitating an exogenous donor DNA template. Here, we used in-PAM or near-PAM CRISPR strategies to induce a double-strand break (DSB) in mutant alleles. Following the DSB, the wild-type homologous chromosome itself serves as an endogenous DNA donor template and initiates the correction of the mutant allele. Concurrently treating the cells with HDR enhancers, such as AZD7648, further improved the efficiency of the correction. We demonstrated the utility of REMEDY in the context of six different diseases with heterozygous mutations such as IBMPFD, cystic fibrosis, progeria, ITPR3-associated combined immunodeficiency, ACTA1, and TBCD in human patient derived primary cells and complementary mouse model cell lines.

"To achieve fast and accurate cortical surface reconstruction from brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs), we develop a method to jointly reconstruct the inner (white-gray matter interface), outer (pial), and midthickness surfaces, regularized by their interdependence. Rather than reconstructing these surfaces separately without taking into consideration their interdependence as in most existing methods, our method learns three diffeomorphic deformations jointly to optimize the midthickness surface to lie halfway between the inner and outer cortical surfaces and simultaneously deforms it inward and outward towards the inner and outer cortical surfaces, respectively. The surfaces are encouraged to have a spherical topology by regularization terms for non-negativeness of the cortical thickness and symmetric cycle-consistency of the coupled surface deformations. The coupled reconstruction of cortical surfaces also facilitates an accurate estimation of the cortical thickness based on the diffeomorphic deformation trajectory of each vertex on the surfaces. Validation experiments have demonstrated that our method achieves state-of-the-art cortical surface reconstruction performance in terms of accuracy and surface topological correctness on large-scale MRI datasets, including ADNI, HCP, and OASIS.1"
"BackgroundCentella asiatica has long been used as a medicinal herb in traditional Asian medicine. Its wound healing, skin improvement, and neuroprotective properties have been widely studied. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by cells and contain bioactive components with therapeutic properties.

ObjectivesThis study aims to characterize EVs isolated from C. asiatica tissue culture and investigate their therapeutic properties using in vitro assays and a UVB-induced damage mouse model.

MethodsEVs were isolated from C. asiatica tissue culture and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cytotoxicity, anti-oxidation, anti-melanin, and anti-inflammation of the EVs were evaluated by MTT assay, tyrosinase assay and RT-qPCR in chemical or in vitro assays. A UVB-induced photodamage mouse model was established to assess the anti-inflammation effect of EVs in vivo. Gels with or without EVs were applied to the damaged site and skin appearance was observed daily and skin histopathology was analyzed on day 7 by H&E and immunohistochemical staining.

ResultsC. asiatica EVs were found to contain high levels of polyphenols and mitigate hydrogen peroxide-induced intracellular ROS. The EVs were further able to reduce intracellular melanin content and tyrosinase activity, and exhibited anti-inflammatory effects by downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes COX2 as well as nitric oxide production. In mice with UVB-induced skin damage, daily application of C. asiatica EV gel reduced skin epidermis thickness and inflammation compared to UVB-only or blank gel at seven days after UV irradiation.

ConclusionsThe beneficial effects of C. asiatica EVs on skin quality warrant further studies as promising agents in skin care applications."
"The mechanical properties of the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm are crucial for the correct and robust functioning of a cell and play a key role in understanding how mechanical signals are transferred to the nucleus. Here, we demonstrate remarkable shape mimicry between the cellular and nuclear shape of oocytes, following the externally applied deformation without direct contact between the cell cortex and the nucleus. This effect arises from a surprisingly soft and fluid-like nucleoplasm that is barely resisting any external strain, while the viscoelastic cytoplasm drives shape transmission. Comparative studies in jellyfish, starfish, and mouse oocytes reveal that lower cytoplasmic elasticity in jellyfish leads to reduced nuclear shape mimicry, highlighting the role of cytoplasmic mechanics in nuclear deformation.

Significance StatementMechanosensing of the nucleus is, in addition to chemical signalling, an important factor in gene expression. Although nuclei are often thought to be rigid inclusions in the cytoplasm of a cell, we show that in oocytes nuclei are much more deformable. Using a combination of intranuclear, intracellular and extracellular measurements, we attribute our findings to a fine balance between the soft nucleoplasm surrounded by an elastic shell and the viscoelastic properties of the cytoplasm."
"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal stem cell disorders characterized by dysregulated megakaryopoiesis and neoplastic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) expansion. Using a murine model with MK-specific JAK2V617F expression, we establish an MPN aging model where mutant MKs drive HSC expansion and a progressive decline in wild-type HSC function. Compared to wild-type MKs, JAK2V617F MKs exhibit heightened inflammation and innate immune activation with aging, including increased antigen presentation, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, skewed T cell populations, and impaired T cell functions in the marrow niche. Enhanced MK immunomodulatory function is linked to mutant cell expansion and MPN progression in a chimeric murine model with co-existing wild-type and JAK2V617F mutant HSCs. LINE-1 (long-interspersed element-1), a retrotransposon linked to innate immune activation and aging, is upregulated in mutant MKs during aging in murine models. We validated that LINE-1-encoded protein ORF1p is expressed in marrow MKs in 12 of 13 MPN patients but absent in control samples from patients undergoing orthopedic surgery (n=5). These findings suggest that MKs reprogram the marrow immune microenvironment, impairing normal HSC function while promoting neoplastic expansion in MPNs. LINE-1 activation in mutant MKs may be a key driver of immune dysregulation in MPNs.

Key PointsO_LIJAK2V617F mutant MKs reprogram the marrow immune microenvironment to promote neoplastic HSC expansion in MPNs.

"The acquisition of novel muscle activity patterns is a key aspect of motor skill learning which can be seen at play, for example, when beginner musicians learn new guitar or piano chords. To study this process, here we introduce a new paradigm that requires quick and synchronous flexion and extension of multiple fingers. First, participants practiced all the 242 possible combinations of isometric finger flexion and extension around the metacarpophalangeal joint (i.e., chords). We found that some chords were initially extremely challenging, but participants could eventually achieve them with practice, showing that the initial difficulty did not reflect hard biomechanical constraints imposed by the interaction of tendons and ligaments. In a second experiment we found that chord learning was largely chord-specific and did not generalize to untrained chords. Finally, we explored which factors make some chords more difficult than others. Difficulty was well predicted by the muscle activity pattern required by that chord. Interestingly, difficulty related to how similar chords muscle activity patterns are to the muscle activity patterns required by everyday hand use, and to the overall size of the muscle activity. Together, our results suggest that the new paradigm introduced in this work may provide a valuable tool to study the neural processes underlying the acquisition of novel muscle activity patterns in the human motor system."
"Chronic stress is a risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders, making the ability to adapt to repeated stress a crucial determinant of mental health. On a molecular level, it remains unclear whether repeated exposure to stress is characterized by habituation - a decreased responsiveness to the same stimulus - or by the emergence of new, adaptive responses. Here, we explore how the tightly regulated molecular response triggered by acute restraint stress becomes altered after repeated restraint exposure. Transcriptomic sampling of the mouse hippocampus at multiple time points revealed that repeated stress leads to widespread habituation, damping stress-induced gene expression of all stress-responsive genes. However, we find no evidence for the emergence of new response profiles or alterations in baseline gene expression. Using single-cell multi-omics, we show that these findings hold true across cell types, and we reveal cell type specific patterns of habituation. Transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiles identify two distinct mechanisms that contribute to the observed habituation patterns: an early cAMP-associated mechanism that is related to blunted transcription after chronic stress, and a late corticosterone-dependent mechanism that is linked to a shortened transcriptional response. These extensive data are integrated, along with our previous work, into an interactive app, providing a uniquely detailed molecular resource that characterizes the acute stress response and the process of habituation across the genome."
"Proper function in a bacterial cell relies on intrinsic cell size regulation. The molecular mechanisms underlying how bacteria maintain their cell size remain unclear. The conserved regulator DnaA, the initiator of chromosome replication, is associated to size regulation by controlling the number of origins of replication (oriC) per cell. In this study, we identify and characterize a new mechanism in which DnaA modulates cell size independently of oriC-copy number. By altering the levels of DnaA without impacting chromosome replication, we demonstrate that DnaAs activity as a transcription factor can slow down cell elongation rate resulting in cells that are [~]20% smaller. We identify the peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzyme MurD as a key player of cell size regulation in Caulobacter crescentus and in the evolutionarily distant bacterium Escherichia coli. Collectively, our findings provide mechanistic insights to the complex regulation of cell size in bacteria."
"Our thoughts often drift away from the tasks at hand. Various factors influence this phenomenon, including changes in the external environment, individual cognitive characteristics, and fluctuations in bodily responses. This study investigated the relationship between autonomic nervous fluctuations and thought state transitions, focusing on individual differences such as cardiac interoception. First, the heartbeat counting task was conducted, and the difference between the reported and actual number of heartbeats was used as an index of interoceptive accuracy. The participants then completed an auditory attention task while their cardiac activities were monitored. During the task, thought probes were randomly presented, and participants selected their thought content from eight categories and rated aspects such as task concentration and arousal. We estimated trial-by-trial thought states in a data-driven manner and examined how the current thought state, autonomic nervous activity, and individual cardiac interoceptive accuracy influenced the thought state in the next trial. The results demonstrated a strong association between higher cardiac interoceptive accuracy and the maintenance of similar states in subsequent trials when accelerated heart rates occurred during self-related thought states. Furthermore, the participants with higher depressive tendencies and interoceptive accuracy exhibited an increased likelihood of transitioning to self-related states when experiencing decreased heart rate during task-concentrated states. These results suggest that accurately detecting heart rate changes associated with specific thought states facilitates updates in first-person conscious experience, thereby biasing the transition patterns of subsequent thought states. This study provides new insights into the cognitive and physiological mechanisms underlying the dynamics of spontaneous thought."
"Nitrification occurs widely from the deep sea to animal holobionts, but the eco-evolutionary forces shaping the niches and dynamics of the lineages of the chemoautotrophic bacteria and archaea responsible remain largely unknown. To make strides towards this goal in a rapidly changing, exemplar marine ecosystem, the Baltic Sea, we studied basin-scale nitrifier spatio-temporal dynamics, coupled with enrichment-enabled comparative genomics. Based on metagenomes and rRNA gene sequencing, we found nitrifiers to be persistently relatively abundant throughout deep depths (>25 m), and from late-fall to spring in surface waters, as revealed by twice-weekly sampling across two years in the southwest Baltic Sea surface waters. In these surface waters, we observed time-lagged dynamics between ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizers, which were positively correlated with nitrite, nitrate, and diverse other prokaryotes, and negatively correlated with day length, light, and chlorophyll. For the dominant nitrifiers, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), we enriched five novel species including the dominant deep Baltic Sea species, and obtained genomes from all dominant AOA phylotypes. Among these genomes, which enabled fine-scale niche-differentiation, we observed a high degree of gene conservation, with most differences related to genes associated with interactions with the external environment, including genes involved in signal transduction, cell wall/membrane biogenesis, and inorganic ion transport, indicating these may be the primary drivers of strain-variability. We also observed differences in nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism between two dominant surface types. Together our study provides key insights into the niche of nitrifiers, and begins the process of understanding the mechanisms and functional implications of these patterns."
"Dissociated neuronal cultures on High-Density Multi-Electrode Arrays (HD-MEAs) provide a controllable in vitro platform to systematically investigate the formation, development, and functioning of neural circuits, as well as their response to a wide array of electrical and pharmacological manipulations. Yet, this potential cannot be fully exploited without a a reliable characterization of the intricate web of causal interconnections within the culture. In this work, we present a protocol to map the network-wide impact of focal stimulation by sequentially stimulating individual sites and recording the evoked responses across the culture. We demonstrate that evoked responses are consistent and replicable across stimulation trials, allowing us to map causal links in terms of the strength of stimulus-response effects, termed Interventional Connectivity (IC). However, this time-consuming protocol may be inconvenient for experimental settings that demand rapid recordings or no perturbation, such as analyses of spontaneous plasticity. We thus investigate whether IC can be predicted from the networks ongoing activity by comparing it to Effective Connectivity (EC) estimates derived from relatively short (10 minutes) recordings of spontaneous, unperturbed activity. We show that EC is strongly informative of IC, regardless of the specific metric used for EC inference (Transfer Entropy, Signed Cross-Correlation, or Cross-Covariance), proving that spontaneous activity can reliably reveal key aspects of the cultures causal architecture. Our findings open the way to robust network analyses of in vitro neuronal systems, and the design of effective, targeted stimulation experiments exploiting the cultures strongest connections or most highly connected sites."
"Cell wall integrity (CWI) is regulated by the coordinated activity of CW-modifying enzymes, including pectin methylesterases (PMEs) and their inhibitors (PMEIs). PMEs de-methylesterify pectins, making them more susceptible to degradation and loosening the CW, facilitating pathogen invasion. Conversely, PMEIs inhibit PMEs, reinforcing the CWI and enhancing plant defense. However, how biotrophic pathogens overcome PMEI-mediated defense remains unclear. Here, we report that smut fungal effectors have evolved to directly target host specific PMEIs, manipulating cell wall integrity to enhance virulence. N-glycosylated Effector 1 (Nge1) from Ustilago maydis selectively interact with PMEI45 and PMEI46, as well as the auto-inhibitory PRO-domains of PMEs. This interaction disrupts PMEI inhibition, liberating PME19 and PME20, which reduce pectin methylesterification and likely loosen the CW, promoting fungal invasion. Notably, the interaction between Nge1 and PMEI45, but not PMEI46, is N-glycosylation-dependent. Restoring glycosylation in a non-glycosylated Nge1 ortholog allows it to functionally replace U. maydis Nge1, suggesting that smut fungal effectors have evolved through glycan modifications to overcome host-adapted PMEIs that would otherwise escape non-glycosylated effectors and impede fungal infection. Our findings reveal bidirectional host-pathogen strategies in a co-evolutionary arms race to fine-tune molecular interactions in the extracellular space."
"IntroBrain-age models quantify biological ageing by predicting a persons age from neuroimaging data. In early life, brain-age can reflect underlying biological maturity (or immaturity), providing a candidate predictor of typical neurodevelopment versus deviation. Although widely used in adult research, the use of brain-age in early development has been limited due to data availability, heterogeneity and restricted model accessibility. Here, we introduce BabyPy, a shareable brain-age model for individuals aged 0-17 years that achieves accurate predictions despite substantial variability in site, scanner, and preprocessing pipelines.

MethodsWe trained BabyPy on 4,021 structural T1-weighted MRI scans from multi-site datasets (ages 0-17 years). An external test set of 1,143 scans (ages 0-16 years) was used for validation. Coarse neuroimaging features - grey matter volume (GMV), white matter volume (WMV), and subcortical grey matter volume (sGMV) - along with sex, were the model inputs. An ensemble machine learning approach combined Extra Trees Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Multilayer Perceptron base models. Performance was evaluated via 5-fold cross-validation and external testing.

ResultsThe ensemble meta-model explained 80% of the variance in age (training set, MAE = 1.55 years) and 46% of the variance in the external test set (MAE = 1.72 years).

ConclusionBabyPy is a shareable framework that estimates brain-age across a broad developmental range, removing the need for separate age-specific models. Despite limitations due to data heterogeneity, it demonstrates robust predictive performance and supports cross-study comparisons. Future improvements in data harmonisation will further enhance the utility of generic brain-age models like BabyPy.

"Fever during influenza A virus (IAV) infection is triggered by the innate immune response. Various factors contribute to this response, including IAV mini viral RNAs (mvRNA), which trigger RIG-I signaling when their replication and transcription are dysregulated by template loops (t-loop). While fever is a symptom of the infection, it also alters the environment in which virus replicates. This changing environment may impact the viral infection cycle and in turn disease outcome. Here we show that IAV infection at temperatures that simulate fever leads to increased mvRNA synthesis and antiviral signaling. Mathematical modeling and experimental analyses reveal that differential IAV nucleoprotein and RNA polymerase production underlies the increased mvRNA level. Moreover, at the higher infection temperature mvRNAs with dysregulating t-loops contribute most to the innate immune activation. We propose that fever-enhanced mvRNA production is a self-amplifying feedback loop that may affect infection outcome."
"Stealth properties of nanoparticles are essential for their proper functionalization in biological systems. To address limitations of polyethylene glycol (PEG), commonly used for this purpose, we explore the potential of polysarcosine (PSar) as stealth shell in peptide-functionalized dye-loaded polymeric NPs. To this end, polymeric NPs loaded with rhodamine dye with bulky hydrophobic counterion and bearing azide groups at their surface were grafted with PSar of different lengths ranging from 5 to 19 sarcosine units using strain-promoted cycloaddition. The obtained peptide-functionalized NPs showed remarkable colloidal stability in physiological media. The length of PSar showed a profound effect on stealth properties of NPs. The increase in the length of grafted PSar lead to decrease in the negative surface charge to nearly neutral values and decreased protein adsorption according to fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The NPs with 19mer PSar showed minimal interactions with live cells and glass surfaces in a complex biological medium, in contrast to its shorter PSar analogues. These stealth NPs bearing HaloTag ligand enabled specific targeting of proteins at the cell surface. The obtained results show that a relatively short PSar peptide can be used for achieving stealth properties in polymeric NPs, allowing specific protein targeting with minimized non-specific interactions. The obtained PSar-functionalized polymeric NPs appear as a powerful platform for the fabrication of the next generation of nanomaterials for bioimaging and biosensing applications."
"Increasingly many methods have been reported for perturbing and sampling AlphaFold2 (AF2) [1]. However, if multiple methods achieve similar results, that does not in itself invalidate any method, nor does it answer why these methods work. To help the field continue to try to answer these questions, this work contains our responses to misunderstandings by Porter et al. and inaccurate analyses and conclusions across five references [2-6] that criticize the AF-Cluster method [7]. Our responses are organized in the chronological order that references [2-6] were published. Deep learning methods development moves quickly, and by no means did we think that the implementation of AF-Cluster in [7] would be the final word on how to sample multiple conformations. However, Porter et al.s primary critique, that AF-Cluster does not use local evolutionary couplings in its MSA clusters, is incorrect. We report here further analysis that underscores our original finding that local evolutionary couplings do indeed play an important role in AF-Cluster predictions, and refute all false claims made against [7]. We have created a more user-friendly Colab notebook that now integrates the AF-Cluster sequence clustering step with other AF2 sampling methods, enabling the community to more readily compare predictions from these different methods."
"The design of large genetic circuits requires genetic regulatory devices capable of performing complex logic operations. Hybrid riboswitches, synthetically enhanced compact RNA elements (<100 nucleotides) that form a tertiary structure with the ability to specifically bind two different target molecules, can be used to design genetic regulators that emulate Boolean logic. When inserted into the 5 UTR of an mRNA, these devices can regulate translation initiation upon specific binding of one or both ligands. The goal of this study is to design hybrid riboswitches that emulate Boolean NAND logic in yeast. We propose a novel machine learning-based design framework combining high-throughput in vivo screening and deep Bayesian optimization. Through an initial screening, we discovered a hybrid riboswitch with NAND behavior. Using batch Bayesian optimization with an ensemble neural network as surrogate, we further improve the NAND functionality of our hybrid riboswitch with respect to a performance score, thereby achieving near digital NAND behavior. With its focus on model-based and score-driven design, our proposed method can complement experiment driven approaches by allowing fine grained adaptation of functionality, including constructs sensitive to single nucleotide changes."
"Niche construction, a central eco-evolutionary process in which organisms modify their environment, is hypothesised to enhance evolutionary adaptability through feedback between genetic inheritance and the lasting effects of environmental change--known as ecological inheritance. However, while theoretically intriguing, direct empirical support for the effect of niche construction on adaptation is lacking. Red flour beetles modify their environment by releasing quinone-rich stink gland secretions, a form of external immunity. Here, we test in an evolution experiment how experimental removal of niche construction--using RNAi of a key gene needed to produce stink gland secretions--affects the beetles adaptation to the bacterial entomopathogen Bacillus thuringiensis. In each generation, beetles inhabited conditioned flour either with regular or drastically reduced stink gland secretion content. Compared to the non-exposed control, all bacteria-exposed regimes rapidly evolved bacterial resistance within only six generations. However, beetles evolving with intact niche construction acquired resistance as soon as after three generations, indicating that adaptation was initially facilitated by niche construction. RNAseq of evolved beetles showed that gene expression differed strongly between the selection regimes, revealing that the mechanisms underlying resistance were dependent on niche construction. Thus, our findings provide urgently needed empirical evidence on the role of niche construction for resistance evolution and its potential genetic basis."
"Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming, bacterial pathogen of humans and animals. C. perfringens also produces type IV pili (T4P) and has two complete sets of T4P-associated genes, one of which has been shown to produce surface pili needed for cell adherence. One hypothesis about the second set of T4P genes is that they comprise a system analogous to the type II secretion systems (TTSS) found in Gram-negative bacteria, which is used to export folded proteins from the periplasm through the outer membrane to the extracellular environment. Gram-positive bacteria have a similar secretion barrier in the thick peptidoglycan (PG) layer, which blocks secretion of folded proteins >25 kD. To determine if the T4P-associated genes comprise a Gram-positive TTSS, the secretome of mutants lacking type IV pilins were examined and a single protein, a von Willebrand A domain containing protein, BsaC (CPE0517), was identified as being dependent on pilin PilA3 for secretion. The bsaC gene is in an operon with genes encoding a SipW signal peptidase and two putative biofilm matrix proteins BsaA and BsaB, both of which have remote homology to Bacillus subtilis biofilm protein TasA. Since BsaA forms long oligomers that are secreted, we analyzed BsaA monomer interactions with de novo modeling. These models projected that the monomers formed isopeptide bonds as part of a donor strand exchange process, in which an N-terminal disordered loop of one monomer intercalates into a beta sheet structure of an adjacent monomer and reforms into a beta sheet with subsequent isopeptide bond formation. Mutations in residues predicted to form the isopeptide bonds led to loss of oligomerization, supporting an exchange and lock mechanism. Phylogenetic analysis showed the BsaA family of proteins are widespread among bacteria and archaea but only a subset is predicted to form isopeptide bonds.

ImportanceFor bacteria to secrete folded proteins to the environment, they have to overcome the physical barriers of an outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria and the thick peptidoglycan layer in Gram-positive bacteria. One mechanism to do this is the use of a Type II secretion system in Gram-negative bacteria, which has a structure similar to type IV pili and is modeled to act as a piston that pumps folded proteins through the outer membrane to the environment. Clostridium perfringens, like all or most all of the clostridia, has type IV pili and, in fact, has two sets of pilus-associated genes. Here we present evidence that C. perfringens uses one set of pilus genes to secrete a biofilm associated protein and may be responsible for secreting the main biofilm protein, BsaA. We show that BsaA monomers are, unlike most other biofilm matrix proteins, linked by intermolecular isopeptide bonds, enhancing the physical strength of BsaA fibers."
"We introduce Pallatom, an innovative protein generation model capable of producing protein structures with all-atom coordinates. Pallatom directly learns and models the joint distribution P(structure, seq) by focusing on P(all-atom), effectively addressing the interdependence between sequence and structure in protein generation. To achieve this, we propose a novel network architecture specifically designed for all-atom protein generation. Our model employs a dual-track framework that tokenizes proteins into residue-level and atomic-level representations, integrating them through a multi-layer decoding process with ""traversing"" representations and recycling mechanism. We also introduce the atom14 representation method, which unifies the description of unknown side-chain coordinates, ensuring high fidelity between the generated all-atom conformation and its physical structure. Experimental results demonstrate that Pallatom excels in key metrics of protein design, including designability, diversity, and novelty, showing significant improvements across the board. Our model not only enhances the accuracy of protein generation but also exhibits excellent sampling efficiency, paving the way for future applications in larger and more complex systems."
"Clustering is a critical step in the analysis of single-cell data, as it enables the discovery and characterization of putative cell types and states. However, most popular clustering tools do not subject clustering results to statistical inference testing, leading to risks of overclustering or underclustering data and often resulting in ineffective identification of cell types with widely differing prevalence. To address these challenges, we present CHOIR (clustering hierarchy optimization by iterative random forests), which applies a framework of random forest classifiers and permutation tests across a hierarchical clustering tree to statistically determine which clusters represent distinct populations. We demonstrate the enhanced performance of CHOIR through extensive benchmarking against 14 existing clustering methods across 100 simulated and 4 real single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomic, and multi-omic datasets. CHOIR can be applied to any single-cell data type and provides a flexible, scalable, and robust solution to the important challenge of identifying biologically relevant cell groupings within heterogeneous single-cell data."
"Despite decades of neuroimaging research, how white matter develops along the length of major tracts in humans remains unknown. Here, we identify fundamental patterns of white matter maturation by examining developmental variation along major, long-range cortico-cortical tracts in youth ages 5-23 years using diffusion MRI from three large-scale, cross-sectional datasets (total N = 2,716). Across datasets, we delineate two replicable axes of human white matter development. First, we find a deep-to-superficial axis, in which superficial tract regions near the cortical surface exhibit greater age-related change than deep tract regions. Second, we demonstrate that the development of superficial tract regions aligns with the cortical hierarchy defined by the sensorimotor-association axis, with tract ends adjacent to sensorimotor cortices maturing earlier than those adjacent to association cortices. These results reveal developmental variation along tracts that conventional tract-average analyses have previously obscured, challenging the implicit assumption that white matter tracts mature uniformly along their length. Such developmental variation along tracts may have functional implications, including mitigating ephaptic coupling in densely packed deep tract regions and tuning neural synchrony through hierarchical development in superficial tract regions - ultimately refining neural transmission in youth."
"Brains excel at robust decision-making and data-efficient learning. Understanding the architectures and dynamics underlying these capabilities can inform inductive biases for deep learning. We present a multi-region brain model that explores the normative role of structured memory circuits in a spatially embedded binary decision-making task from neuroscience. We counterfactually compare the learning performance and neural representations of reinforcement learning (RL) agents with brain models of different interaction architectures between grid and place cells in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, coupled with an action-selection cortical recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that a specific architecture- where grid cells receive and jointly encode self-movement velocity signals and decision evidence increments-optimizes learning efficiency while best reproducing experimental observations relative to alternative architectures. Our findings thus suggest brain-inspired structured architectures for efficient RL. Importantly, the models make novel, testable predictions about organization and information flow within the entorhinal-hippocampal-neocortical circuit: we predict that grid cells must conjunctively encode position and evidence for effective spatial decision-making, directly motivating new neurophysiological experiments.*"
"In common with most physiological activities, sleep is a highly evolutionarily conserved function. Nevertheless, the purpose of sleep remains inadequately investigated. One possible cause of this deficiency is the limitations of the traditional methods used for examining sleep. Up to this time, the mainstay tool used to look at the evolutionary basis of sleep has been phylogenetic analysis. This approach has provided many valuable insights into sleep, yet it has left many questions unanswered. The present study uses a relatively new hybrid technique at the interface of phylogenetics and genomics, known as phylogenomic analysis. This study is the first to use phylogenomic analysis to investigate the basis of sleep by evaluating the presence and conservation of sleep-related genes in the reconstructed genome of the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). Our gene set enrichment analysis of humans and LUCA indicates that the conserved sleep genes are linked to signaling, metabolism, and circadian rhythm pathways, suggesting that these genes possess primordial roles in essential physiological functions. These findings indicate that the component genes carry out essential physiological tasks that were subsequently repurposed to regulate sleep in more advanced organisms throughout evolution. This study lays the foundation for a systematic phylogenomic exploration of sleep-related genes, connecting molecular evolution with sleep science. By tracing the biological history of sleep to its deep evolutionary origins, our research presents novel insights into sleeps nature, origin, and evolutionary function, paving the way for further interdisciplinary exploration of the biology of sleep.

"The sulfur metabolism is tightly regulated in cells. Cysteine, at physiological concentrations, plays a crucial role in protein assembly, as well as in coenzyme and metabolic intermediate synthesis. Additionally, cysteine is biotransformed into H2S, a gasotransmitter with several roles on cells, ranging from regulating mitochondrial metabolism to producing metabolic intermediates and mediating post-translational modification of proteins. While H2S has been shown to participate in the infection processes of animal pathogenic fungi, its role in phytopathogenic fungi remains unexplored. Here, we describe the conditions required to induce endogenous production of H2S in plant pathogenic fungi Ustilago maydis. Under these conditions, we observed an increased infection rate and more pronounced symptoms in maize plants. A label-free proteomic assay to examine adaptations of U. maydis under H2S-producing conditions shown an increased expression of extracellular enzymes required for virulence and mitochondrial proteins related to cellular respiration, ATP synthesis, and fatty acid degradation, along with enhanced expression of proteins involved in proteasomal degradation. Conversely, we found reduced expression of proteins associated with antioxidant responses, glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway. These mitochondrial protein alterations correlated with increased mitochondrial biogenesis, ultrastructural changes, inhibition of the cytochrome respiratory pathway, and elevated activity of an alternative oxidase. Additionally, H2O2 production increased, while the enzymatic capacity for its detoxification decreased. Impaired lipid accumulation and altered intracellular distribution were also observed. Thus, in U. maydis, the modulation of cysteine metabolism regulates mitochondrial function, protein expression, lipid metabolism and infectious processes.

Author SummaryUstilago maydis is a basidiomycete fungus that infects corn plants, inducing tumor formation. While in some countries this infection causes significant losses in maize crops, in Mexico, U. maydis, known as ""huitlacoche,"" is celebrated as a culinary delicacy with important nutritional value. Additionally, it serves as an interesting model for studying infection by dimorphic phytopathogenic fungi.

Animal models of fungal pathogenesis show that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), whether exogenously provided or induced by supplementation with its precursor cysteine, plays a role in infection processes in both the pathogen and the host cell.

In this study, we explored the role of cysteine in the morphology, metabolism, and pathogenicity of U. maydis. Our findings indicate that cysteine treatment triggers an overproduction of H2S, alters mitochondrial morphology and nitrogen metabolism, and disrupts the oxidative balance in U. maydis. Furthermore, fungi to cysteine enhance tumor formation and anthocyanins accumulation in Zea mays plants. These findings suggest that H2S may play a key role in the infection efficiency of phytopathogenic fungi."
"The high functionality of DNA nanostructures makes them a promising tool for biomedical applications, their intrinsic instability under application-relevant conditions, still remains challenging. Protective coating of DNA nanostructures with materials like silica or cationic polymers has evolved as a simple, yet powerful strategy to improve their stability even under extreme conditions. While over time, various materials and protocols have been developed, the characterization and quality assessment of the coating is either time consuming, highly invasive or lacks detailed insights on single nanostructures. Here, we introduce a cyanine dye based molecular sensor designed to non-invasively probe the coating of DNA origami by either a cationic polymer or by silica, in real-time and on a single nanostructure level. The cyanine dye reports changes in its local environment upon coating via increased fluorescence lifetime induced by steric restriction and water exclusion. Exploiting the addressability of DNA origami, the molecular sensor can be placed at selected positions to probe the coating layer with nanometer precision. We demonstrate the reversibility of the sensor and use it to study the stability of the different coatings in degrading conditions. To showcase the potential for correlative studies, we combine the molecular fluorescence lifetime sensor with DNA PAINT super-resolution imaging to investigate coating and structural integrity as well as preserved addressability of DNA nanostructures. The reported sensor presents a valuable tool to probe the coating of DNA nanodevices in complex biochemical environments in real-time and at the single nanosensor level and aids the development of novel stabilization strategies."
"SummaryPICRUSt2 is a bioinformatic tool that predicts microbial functions in amplicon sequencing data using a database of annotated reference genomes. We have constructed an updated database for PICRUSt2 that has substantially increased the number of bacterial (19,493 to 26,868) and archaeal (406 to 1,002) genomes as well as the number of functional annotations present. The previous PICRUSt2 database relied on many timely and computationally intensive manual processes that made it difficult to update. We constructed a new streamlined process to allow regular upgrades to the PICRUSt2 database on an ongoing basis, and used this process to create a new database, PICRUSt2-SC (Sugar-Coated). Additionally, we have shown that this updated database contains genomes that more closely match study sequences from a range of different environments. The genomes contained in the database therefore better represent these environments and this leads to an improvement in the predicted functional annotations obtained from PICRUSt2.

"The increasing occurrence of orthopedic disorders calls for advancements in techniques and implant technologies. The sensitive nature of the spinal cord highlights the need for implants with specific mechanical and biological properties that imitate those of bone. Nitinol alloy, known for its super-elasticity, bone-like elastic modulus, and excellent compatibility with living tissues is emerging as a favored material for orthopedic implants. In this research, a nitinol lumbar vertebral implant was created using a two-step procedure involving rod fabrication through sintering and braiding techniques focusing on assessing the effects of incorporating braiding into the structure. This method aimed to achieve both mechanical and biological properties simultaneously. In previous techniques, there was a greater focus on one of these properties. However, in this approach, the addition of the braid was an innovative way to append and enhance the biological properties. Examination under Scanning Electron Microscopy revealed a pore size of 310 micrometers in the samples while Atomic Force Microscopy showed a roughness of 971.1 nm both properties are proper for bone cells. Corrosion resistance was evaluated using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and the measured amount was 7366 ohm.cm2. Biological tests confirmed that the samples were biocompatible and non-toxic, with a cell viability rate of 95.1% observed over a period of 21 days. The development of this type of implant aims to improve the treatment outcomes for vertebral area surgeries."
"Corynebacterium glutamicum is a promising microbial chassis for the industrial production of L-tryptophan, which has exhibited increasing demand due to its diverse applications and high market value. In previous work, we developed an L-tryptophan-overproducing C. glutamicum strain TR26 through multiple rounds of rational metabolic engineering. Here, comparative transcriptome and metabolome analyses were conducted between TR26 and its progenitor strain MB001 to reveal the underlying mechanisms and potential bottlenecks for L-tryptophan production in TR26. Furthermore, by systematically down- and up-regulating differentially expressed genes of interest, two novel genetic targets, glnK and sugR, were identified as being associated with L-tryptophan synthesis. Specifically, the repression of glnK and overexpression of sugR in strain TR26 increased the titer of L-tryptophan by 6.7% and 20.9%, respectively. Gene transcription profiling and intracellular metabolite analysis further suggested that the observed improvements in L-tryptophan synthesis could be attributed to optimized nitrogen transport and metabolism, efficient reallocation of cellular resources and enhanced supply of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). This study advances our understanding of the regulation mechanisms governing L-tryptophan synthesis in C. glutamicum and provides valuable insights for further optimization of industrial cell factories."
"Identifying variation in vocal morphology and sound production mechanisms is essential to understanding vocal diversity. Rodents provide an ideal system for exploring this variation as they use multiple sound production mechanisms and have novel vocal structures whose morphology varies interspecifically. Here, we describe the laryngeal morphology and identify the sound production mechanism of Alstons singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina), which produce stereotyped songs. We used micro-computed tomography to examine laryngeal morphology and manipulated excised larynges and surgically ablated a laryngeal muscle to determine sound production mechanism and frequency control. Laryngeal manipulations indicated that a whistle mechanism, likely an edge tone or shallow cavity, produces song. Singing mouse whistles are unique compared to other rodents because they rely on the inflation of an enlarged intralaryngeal air sac called the ventral pouch. Whistle frequency can be controlled by ventral pouch inflation, laryngeal airflow, and by cricothyroid muscle action. Cricothyroid ablation inhibited frequency modulation in vivo, suggesting that singing mice use this muscle during singing. Singing mouse laryngeal morphology and vocal mechanism are distinct from other Neotomids; instead of using vocal fold oscillations for loud, long-distance calls and whistles for close-range interactions, singing mice appear to use whistles for distant and close exchanges by inflating their intralaryngeal air sac. Air sacs have evolved repeatedly among vocalizing mammals and our results indicate a new role for these structures in generating sound. Together, our results expand on an emerging story of how biomechanic and morphological variation contributes to vocal diversity."
"Viruses are generally considered tiny biological entities with small genomes; however, some dsDNA viruses, known as giant viruses, have large genomes that are comparable to those of small bacteria. Previous studies indicated that the genomes of giant viruses expanded from a small ancestor by a combination of gene duplication, de novo gene creation, and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Among them, virus-to-virus HGTs are recently recognized as an important mechanism for disseminating functional genes between giant viruses. In this study, we isolated a giant virus of a member of pandoraviruses, which have the largest genome sizes reaching 2.5 Mbp. Based on the average nucleotide identity of known pandoraviruses, this new pandoravirus belongs to an existing viral species. However, its genome was approximately 200 kbp larger than those of the other strains from the same species. A genome-wide comparison identified a 180-kbp region with 168 genes missing from the other strains but found in phylogenetically distant pandoraviruses. The GC ratio and homology of the deduced amino acid sequences in this 180-kbp region suggest that the new virus horizontally acquired this region from a distantly related pandoravirus. The gene composition in the 180-kbp region further indicates that this region was already large at the time of the horizontal transfer. Our findings suggest that pandoraviruses can horizontally exchange a large portion of their genomes. This event presumably represents one mechanism for accelerating genomic evolution and gigantism in giant viruses."
"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea that seriously threatens public health. The disruption of normal gut microbiota by the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents enables C. difficile to proliferate in the colon. The emergence and prevalence of hypervirulent C. difficile strains result in increased morbidity, mortality, and high recurrence rates of CDI, thus creating a pressing need for novel therapeutics. The multi-domain toxins TcdA and TcdB are the primary determinants of CDI pathogenesis, rendering them ideal drug targets in the anti-virulence paradigm. In this study, we identified caffeic acid and its derivatives from natural compounds library as active inhibitors of TcdB via a cell-based high-throughput phenotypic screening. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) could directly bind to TcdB, thus suppressing InsP6-induced autoproteolysis and inhibiting glucosyltransferase activity. CAPE treatment remarkably reduces the pathology of CDI in a murine infection model in terms of alleviated diarrhea symptoms, decreased bacterial colonization, and relieved histopathological lesions. Moreover, CAPE treatment of C. difficile-challenged mice induces a remarkable increase in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota and alterations of gut metabolites (e.g., adenosine, D-proline, and melatonin), which might partially contribute to the therapeutic outcomes of CAPE against CDI. Our results reveal the potential of CAPE as a therapeutic for the management of CDI, or CAPE might serve as a lead compound for the development of antivirulence drugs targeting TcdB."
"Primary cilia are hair-like sensory organelles that project from the cell bodies of most cell types, including appetite-regulatory hypothalamic neurons where they likely help sense metabolic factors to regulate food intake. We hypothesized that characterising the proteins present in the primary cilia of hypothalamic neurons would shed mechanistic insights into their sensory role and identify new therapeutic targets for obesity. We therefore targeted the ascorbate peroxidase APEX2 to primary cilia in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived hypothalamic neurons to biotinylate and identify ciliary proteins. Among the cilia-enriched proteins, we identified synaptic proteins, neurotransmitter receptors, and cell-cell adhesion and axon guidance proteins, extending recent findings that primary cilia interact with neuronal synapses. We also found genes associated with increased body weight and metabolic phenotypes that could represent new therapeutic targets including the lysophosphatidic receptor 1 (LPAR1), which we validated is cilia-localized and we confirmed that its ligand (LPA) mediates ciliary shortening. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which primary cilia functionally impact appetite-regulatory neurons."
"Mutation bias is an important factor determining the diversity of genetic variants available for selection. As adaptation proceeds and some beneficial mutations are fixed, new beneficial mutations become rare, limiting further adaptation. The depletion of beneficial mutations is especially stark within the mutational class favoured by the existing mutation bias. Recent theoretical work predicts that this problem may be alleviated by a change in the direction of mutation bias (i.e., a bias reversal). If populations sample previously underexplored types of mutations, the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations should shift towards more beneficial mutations. Here, we test this prediction using Escherichia coli, which has a transition mutation bias, with [~]54% single-nucleotide mutations being transitions compared to the unbiased expectation of [~]33% transitions. We generated mutant strains with a wide range of mutation biases, from 97% transitions to 98% transversions, either reinforcing or reversing the wild type transition bias. Quantifying DFEs of [~]100 single mutations obtained from mutation accumulation experiments for each strain, we find strong support for the theoretical prediction. Strains that oppose the ancestral bias (i.e., with a strong transversion bias) have DFEs with the highest proportion of beneficial mutations, whereas strains that exacerbate the ancestral transition bias have up to 10-fold fewer beneficial mutations. Such dramatic differences in the DFE should drive large variation in the rate and outcome of adaptation, suggesting an important and generalized evolutionary role for mutation bias shifts."
"The Drosophila intestine is a powerful model for stem cell dynamics and epithelial biology, yet no intestinal derived cell lines have been available until now. Here, we describe the establishment of Drosophila intestinal cell lines. The cell lines were derived from the embryonic intestine through specific RasV12 expression and show continuous proliferation and the ability to be frozen and re-thawed. Each derived cell line exhibited morphological and cellular heterogeneity. Single-cell RNA sequencing confirmed their intestinal origin and cell populations with unique enriched signaling pathways. In addition, L15, one of the three lines, formed 3D spheroids that displayed epithelial polarity. Together, these lines provide an additional resource for studying intestinal development, epithelial organization, and pest management."
"Inborn errors of lysosomal function often provoke disorders presenting highly variable onset, diverse visceral, neurologic and psychiatric symptoms and reduced life spans. A prime example is Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPCD). At present, therapeutic options are limited to palliative care and disease-modifying drugs, and there is a need for new treatments. Here, we explored bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins as a new drug target for NPCD using patient-derived skin fibroblasts. Treatment of cells with JQ1, a prototype BET protein inhibitor, enhanced the level of NPC1 protein, diminished lysosomal expansion and cholesterol accumulation, and induced extracellular release of lysosomal components in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The effect of JQ1 on protein levels was largely independent from the patient line tested, but the extent of cholesterol reduction varied in a line-dependent manner. Lastly, JQ1 enhanced and reduced cholesterol accumulation induced by inhibition of NPC1 activity and of histone deacetylases, respectively. Taken together, our results provide further evidence for epigenetic regulation of cellular NPC1 levels and cholesterol homeostasis. Pharmacologic inhibition of bromodomain proteins should be explored as candidate therapeutic approach for NPCD and as a tool to understand basic mechanisms of lysosomal function and lipid metabolism."
"The hand grasp of an object is normally consistent, determined by the optimal, most efficient strategy learnt from previous experience. Yet in certain settings, despite object properties remaining constant and intention the same, the grasp chosen by an individual can vary with a lack of clear preference for a particular grasp configuration. This is referred to as motor ambiguity. Here, we compare the influence of preceding static versus dynamic visual information on participants choice between two possible hand configurations when grasping an object at various orientations. We confirm previous findings that presentation of an object in an initial static orientation prior to the grasping in ambiguous orientation causes subjects to select a grasp that would be most congruent with the initial, determinate orientation. However, we unexpectedly found that when object rotation is observed between the initial and target positions, the bias is inversed, i.e. subjects choose the alternate grasp configurations. Furthermore, the inverse bias strength was found to be independent of the motion magnitude, and persists even when greater decision time is allowed. We provide evidence that this bias effect is not a perceptual phenomenon, and suggest it is potentially a behavioural manifestation of inhibitory circuits that delay decisions in conditions of motor ambiguity."
"BackgroundAs the role of hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) constituting ductular reactions in pathogenesis remains ambiguous, we aimed to establish the in vivo cause-and-effect relationship between HPCs and chronic liver disease progression. We previously demonstrated that peritumoral ductules are associated with angiogenesis in liver tumors and forkhead box L1 (Foxl1)-expressing murine HPCs secrete angiogenic factors in vitro. Therefore, we hypothesized that HPCs are capable of remodeling the portal vascular microenvironment and regulating overall liver disease progression, and this function of HPCs is dependent on recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJ), a key effector of the Notch signaling pathway.

Methods and ResultsWe generated HPC-specific Rbpj conditional knockout mice (CKO) using Foxl1-Cre and treated them with the DDC diet to induce chronic liver disease. CKO mice exhibited a significant reduction in serum levels of liver injury markers, ductular reactions, vascular and fibrotic areas, and hepatic expression of fibrosis and inflammation markers compared to control mice (WT). Single-nucleus RNA sequencing comparing CKO and WT livers detected transcriptome changes across multiple cell types, including endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, and cholangiocytes. Expression of several reactive cholangiocyte markers, including vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), in HPCs was significantly downregulated in response to anti-Rbpj shRNAs in vitro. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that the percentage of VCAM1+ cells was reduced in both HPC and cholangiocyte populations in CKO compared to WT in vivo.

ConclusionsOur findings reveal Rbpj-dependent expression of reactive cholangiocyte markers in HPCs and demonstrate that Rbpj deletion in HPCs attenuates not only endothelial responses but also liver injury, fibrosis, and VCAM1 expression in cholangiocytes, highlighting the crucial role of HPCs in pathogenic progression."
"The asymmetric mixed carboligation of aldehydes catalyzed by thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzymes provides a sensitive system for monitoring changes in activity, chemo-, and enantioselectivity. While previous studies have shown that organic cosolvents influence these parameters, we now demonstrate that similar effects occur upon addition of water-miscible ionic liquids (ILs). In this study, six ThDP-dependent enzymes were analyzed in the presence of 14 ILs under comparable conditions to assess their influence on enzymatic carboligation reactions yielding 2-hydroxy ketones. ILs exerted a moderate to strong influence on activity and, more notably, altered enantioselectivity. (R)-selective reactions were generally stable upon IL addition, while (S)-selective reactions frequently showed reduced selectivity or even inversion to the (R)-enantiomer. The most significant change was observed for the ApPDC_E469G variant of pyruvate decarboxylase from Acetobacter pasteurianus, where the enantiomeric excess shifted from 86% (S) to 60% (R) in the presence of 9% (w/v) Ammoeng 102. Control experiments indicated that this shift was primarily due to the Ammoeng cation rather than the anion. To explore the molecular basis of this phenomenon, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on wild-type ApPDC and the E469G variant in Ammoeng 101 and Ammoeng 102. The simulations revealed that hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions of the Ammoeng cations interact with the (S)-selective binding pocket, thereby favoring formation of the (R)-product. These results highlight the potential of solvent engineering for modulating enzyme selectivity and demonstrate that MD simulations can capture functionally relevant enzyme-solvent interactions at the atomic level."
"Clinical criteria for substance-use disorder collectively specify a loss of instrumental control over consumption, yet little empirical work has addressed how substance use shapes the utility of agency in motivated behavior. We combined a hierarchical gambling task with cross-sectional substance-use surveys and computational cognitive modeling, to assess the preference for controllable environments in adult humans with self-reported abstinence, across psychostimulant, opioid, alcohol, and sedative use. For psychostimulants, the duration of abstinence strongly modulated the preference for control, without affecting the ability to maximize monetary payoffs. In contrast, for alcohol, the recency of use was more predictive of a preference for environments with divergent outcome distributions, regardless of whether those outcomes were controllable. No effects of abstinence were seen for sedatives. The selective effects of psychostimulant use on the value of control implicate the dopaminergic system in agency coding."
"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a critical global health concern. While AMR research has primarily focused on medical and veterinary settings, the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) through natural environments, including soil, remains poorly understood. This study investigates the relationship between soil physico-chemical properties and ARG abundance in environments with varying levels of anthropogenic impact.Soil samples were collected from agricultural fields (both manured and non-manured) and forests, analyzed for 24 physico-chemical parameters, and subjected to DNA extraction. High-throughput qPCR was used to quantify 27 clinically relevant ARGs and 5 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the samples. Results revealed significant differences in soil properties between arable and forest soils, particularly in water content, humus levels, sand and silt proportions, and mercury concentration (p[&le;]0.05). Arable soils exhibited a significantly higher abundance of ARGs and MGEs (p=0.0247), with certain resistance genes found exclusively in agricultural environments. Correlation analysis identified strong positive associations between MGEs and ARGs, highlighting the role of genetic elements in AMR dissemination. Additionally, soil properties such as aluminum, nitrogen, and magnesium showed positive correlations with ARG and MGE abundance, while sand content and the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio displayed inverse correlations. The results indicate that heavy metal contamination may play a substantial role in AMR spread through co-selection mechanisms. These findings emphasize the influence of environmental factors on AMR dynamics and highlight the need to integrate soil ecology into AMR mitigation strategies within the One Health framework."
"The transfer of information between individuals is fundamental to living systems. Therefore, communication should be studied in various species. Weakly electric fish, Gnathonemus petersii, provides a unique model organism for such investigations due to its advanced electrocommunication capabilities, using electric organ discharges (EODs). Separating EODs from multiple individuals is crucial yet challenging. To remediate it, we developed an unsupervised algorithm for EOD separation in two free-swimming individuals. Using continuous wavelet transform, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, and hierarchical clustering, we achieved accurate discrimination of EODs without the necessity of any training data. This approach overcomes the supervised algorithms based on previously published methods in accuracy and computational efficiency, simplifies experimental procedures, and supports animal well-being by reducing the number of required measurements. Additionally, we introduced a novel technique to map electric signals onto auditory representations, facilitating intuitive analysis of EOD sequences. These advancements lay the groundwork for future studies of EOD-based communication, highlighting the potential of Gnathonemus petersii in neuroethological, psychopharmacological, and translational research."
"To facilitate the study of influenza C (ICV) and influenza D (IDV) viruses, we generated lentiviral pseudotyped viruses (PVs) expressing the hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF) glycoprotein from ICV (C/Minnesota/33/2015) and IDV (D/Swine/Italy/199724-3/2015, D/Bovine/France/5920/2014, and D/Bovine/Ibaraki/7768/2016). The production of these PVs was optimised using different amount of human airway trypsin-like (HAT) protease to enhance HEF maturation, and the transduction efficiency was evaluated in multiple cell lines. Using these PVs, we established a pseudovirus-based microneutralisation (pMN) assay to measure neutralising antibody responses and adapted an esterase activity assay to evaluate PV. Specific antisera neutralised PVs but failed to inhibit esterase activity. These findings confirm that ICV and IDV PVs provide a scalable, sensitive, and safe tool for antiviral screening, and sero-epidemiological research."
"Temperature is perceived primarily via Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels, which are integral to the molecular machinery sensing environmental and cellular signals. Functional evidence of TRP channels involvement in regulating cold-induced developmental/reproductive responses remains scarce. Here we show that mutations affecting cold-sensing TRP channels antagonize the reduction of ovarian development induced by low temperatures (reproductive dormancy) in Drosophila melanogaster. More specifically, mutants for brv1, trp, and trpl significantly lowered dormancy levels at 12{degrees}C, and exhibited well-developed oocytes characterized by advanced vitellogenesis. Similarly, functional knockouts for norpA, a gene encoding a phospholipase C acting downstream to Trp and Trpl, exhibited a reduced dormancy response, suggesting that Ca2+ signalling is key to relaying cold-sensing stimuli during dormancy induction and maintenance. Finally, mutants with altered temperature preference (i.e. exhibiting impaired cold or warm avoidance) differentially responded to cold, either lowering or increasing dormancy levels. In summary, our phenotypic analysis provides functional evidence of developmental/reproductive modulation by specific cold-sensing TRP channels in Drosophila melanogaster, and indicates that temperature preference affects developmental processes. As the studied genes are highly conserved and have mammalian homologues, the potential implications of our findings for human metabolism and drug development are also discussed."
"The first months after a babys birth encompass the most rapid period of postnatal change in the human lifespan, but longitudinal trajectories of white matter maturation in this period remain uncharted. Using densely sampled diffusion tensor images collected longitudinally at a mean rate of 1 scan per 1.55 days, we measured non-linear growth and growth rate trajectories of major white matter tracts from birth to 6 months. Growth rates at birth were 6 to 11 times faster than at 6 months, with tracts less mature at birth developing fastest. When matched on chronological age, shorter gestation infants had less mature white matter at birth but faster growth rates than their longer gestation peers; however, growth trajectories were highly similar when corrected for gestational age. This is the first study to estimate white matter trajectories using dense sampling in the first 6 post-natal months, which can inform the study of neurodevelopmental disorders beginning in infancy."
"PurposeSwidden agriculture is one of the most significant agricultural developments in human history and it has major ecological implications for the structure of the landscapes where it is practiced, yet it has long been theorized to be a primary cause of deforestation. Few studies have explored the structure of swidden mosaics and its relationship to vegetation diversity over large spatial scales.

MethodsWe classify satellite imagery from 18 swidden societies in the African, SE Asian, and American tropics using a random forest model and a segment anything model. We use landscape metrics to describe variation in the composition and configuration of swidden mosaics and develop a nonlinear Bayesian model, accompanied by general mathematical solution, to model the relationship between the local structure of swidden disturbances and vegetation diversity measured from spectral variation.

ResultsOur analysis shows that swidden landscapes can be distinguished by their spatial entropy, connectivity, and patch synchronization. Our modeling results show that amid this variation, several swidden landscapes exhibit a non-linear relationship in which vegetation diversity peaks at intermediate levels of swidden disturbance.

ConclusionBy using approaches from landscape ecology to study the heterogeneity of swidden mosaics, we provide evidence that swidden practices can change landscape structure in ways that increase vegetation diversity when the scale of swidden disturbances occurs at an intermediate level. We suggest that this conclusion provides new insights into the potential environmental outcomes of swidden cultivation which may have significant theoretical implications for interpretations of human paleoecology during the Holocene, and contemporary issues of sustainability."
"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers Disease. Effective inhibition of TNF is essential for mitigating disease progression and improving patient outcomes. In this study, we present the development and comprehensive characterization of potent humanized TNF inhibitory nanobodies (TNFINbs) derived from camelid single-domain antibodies. In silico analysis of the original camelid nanobodies revealed low immunogenicity, which was further reduced through machine-learning-guided humanization and developability optimization. The two humanized TNFI-Nb variants we developed demonstrated exceptional anti-TNF activity, achieving IC50 values in the picomolar range. Binding assays confirmed their high affinity for TNF, underscoring robust neutralization capabilities. These TNFI-Nbs present valid alternatives to conventional monoclonal antibodies currently used in human therapy, offering potential advantages in potency, specificity, and reduced immunogenicity. Our findings establish a solid foundation for further preclinical development and clinical translation of TNF-targeted nanobody therapies in TNF-mediated diseases."
"IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies form a [~]150 kDa homodimer through dimerization of the Fc domain, which prolongs their in vivo half-life via pH-dependent binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). Conformationally stable, half-life-extended monomeric Fc (mFc) variants offer a promising platform for antibodies and Fc-fusion therapeutics, enabling deeper tissue penetration, reduced toxicity, and simplified manufacturing. Due to the loss of binding avidity, mFc requires significantly enhanced FcRn-binding affinity at pH 6.0, but retaining weak binding at neutral pH to achieve comparable serum half-life, making engineering such mFc variants highly challenging. Mainly by computational design approach, we created mFc mutants with diverse human FcRn-binding profiles, including two variants that exhibit 17- and 47-fold stronger FcRn binding at pH 6.0 (KD of 30.7 nM and 88 nM) compared to a baseline mFc, while maintaining greater than 213-fold weaker binding at pH 7.4 (KD of 6,549 nM and 39,150 nM). These variants are highly soluble and display a melting temperature greater than 60.6 {degrees}C, underscoring their potential as platforms for extending the in vivo half-life of therapeutic modalities. Other mFc variants with different pH-responsive FcRn-binding profiles would potentially fit for other therapeutic needs. Moreover, transferring the same variations into IgG4 Fc generated IgG4 mFc variants with FcRn-binding properties similar to those of the parent IgG1 mFc variants. Furthermore, incorporating the FcRn-binding affinity-enhancing substitutions into native Fc produced a dimeric Fc variant that exhibits strong, pH-responsive FcRn-binding affinities, promising an extended half-life in serum."
"Pathological changes in the biomechanical environment of Schlemms canal (SC) inner wall cells, such as substrate stiffening and increased cellular stretch, are associated with ocular hypertension, a key risk factor for the development of glaucoma. Cell membrane stretch can trigger the activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) mechanosensitive ion channels, allowing calcium influx and initiating downstream signaling. However, the precise role of TRPV4 in SC cell mechanobiology remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that sustained inhibition of TRPV4 activity modulates substrate stiffness mechanosensing to thereby affect the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix of SC cells. This is accompanied by a reduction in cell stiffness and an increase in transcellular pore forming ability, potentially lowing outflow resistance and risk of ocular hypertension. Conversely, acute activation of TRPV4 channels induces Ca2+ influx, increasing transcellular pore formation in SC cells. Notaly, reduced TRPV4 mechanosensing was observed in glaucomatous SC cells, resulting in reduced transcellular pore forming ability. These findings suggest novel potential strategies based on targeting TRPV4 in SC cells for the treatment of ocular hypertension in glaucoma."
"The cortico-basal ganglia pathways that mediate vocal learning in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) are localized in parallel circuits formed by CORE and SHELL subregions (Fig. 1). These circuits traverse a cortical region (LMAN), a specialized region of the basal ganglia essential for vocal learning (Area X), and a region of dorsomedial thalamus (DLM). Area X includes functional analogs of mammalian direct and indirect pathways that may have opposing effects and thereby increase or inhibit thalamic activity respectively. Direct pallidal neurons of Area X send projections to DLM, whereas indirect pallidal neurons form intrinsic connections onto DLM-projecting neurons. Expression of the transcription factor FoxP2 in the basal ganglia is necessary for normal vocal learning and production in both humans and songbirds. We used tract-tracing techniques to label direct pallidal Area X[-&gt;]DLM projection neurons and immunohistochemical techniques to label neurons expressing the transcription factor FoxP2 in adult and juvenile male zebra finches. Our results showed that DLM-projecting neurons in Area X did not express FoxP2 in either adults or juveniles. We also observed a population of large neurons that expressed FoxP2 but were not retrogradely-labeled from DLM. A putative marker of striatal neurons (DARPP-32) did not co-localize with FoxP2 in most of these large neurons, suggesting that they form a class of indirect pallidal neurons. These findings offer FoxP2 as a possible marker for indirect pallidal neurons and support the existence of different subpopulations of neurons that correspond to direct and indirect pathways within Area X.

C_FIG Significance statementArea X is a localized region of the basal ganglia in songbirds that mediates vocal learning and behavior and includes CORE and SHELL subregions. Some pallidal neurons in Area X project to thalamus, forming a direct pathway; a separate class of Area X pallidal neurons form local contacts onto direct neurons, forming an indirect pathway. FoxP2 is a transcription factor that is necessary for normal vocal learning and production in both humans and songbirds. We present evidence in adult and juvenile zebra finches that direct thalamus-projecting pallidal neurons do not express FoxP2 while local indirect pallidal neurons do express FoxP2. Thus, large FoxP2-positive neurons appear to form a class of indirect pallidal neurons."
"BackgroundFilamentous plant pathogens secrete effectors to successfully establish host infections. In resistant crop varieties, plant immunity can be triggered by immune receptors that recognize these effectors. Resistant crop varieties are grown in large-scale monocultures imposing strong selection pressure on pathogens, driving rapid evolution of effector repertoires resulting in the frequent breakdowns of resistance within just a few growing seasons. The oomycete Peronospora effusa, responsible for downy mildew on spinach, is an example of a rapidly adapting pathogen, but it is yet unknown how P. effusa can successfully overcome resistance of spinach by genomic adaptations.

ResultsTo close this knowledge gap, we here generated genome assemblies and constructed a pangenome graph for 19 isolates corresponding to 19 officially denominated resistance-breaking P. effusa races, which can cause disease on a differential set of spinach cultivars. Haplotype-resolved pangenome graph analyses revealed that many isolates emerged from recent sexual recombination, yet others evolved via prolonged asexual reproduction and loss of heterozygosity. By phasing effector candidates to determine their allelic variation, we identified effector candidates associated to resistance breaking of spinach varieties and reconstructed the evolutionary events that led to their diversification.

ConclusionsThe here developed and applied computational genomics approaches offer unparalleled insights into the molecular mechanisms of the rapid evolution of P. effusa, and points to potential targets for future resistance breading."
"Chromosome segregation during meiosis is highly error-prone in mammalian oocytes. The mechanisms controlling chromosome attachments and the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) have been extensively studied in meiosis I, but our knowledge of these mechanisms during meiosis II is rather limited. Although mammalian oocytes arrest in metaphase II for an extended period awaiting fertilization, some misattached chromosomes may persist. This suggests that the mechanism correcting misattachments is not fully functional during the arrest. In this study, we investigated whether low inter-kinetochore tension, which characterizes incorrect attachments, can be detected by Aurora B/C-dependent error correction in meiosis II. We found that low tension in early metaphase II does indeed mediate microtubule detachment by Aurora B/C and consequently, anaphase II delay through SAC activation. Surprisingly, we also found that during prolonged metaphase II arrest, Aurora B/C activity is no longer sufficient to detach low-tension attachments, concomitantly with high accumulation of PP2A at kinetochores. As a result, the SAC is not activated and sister chromatids segregate in anaphase II without delay even in the presence of low tension. Hence, during the prolonged metaphase II arrest to await fertilization, oocytes become unable to discriminate between correct and incorrect attachments and may allow errors to persist."
"Neural activity in the brain is known to encode low-dimensional, time-evolving, behaviour-related variables. A long-standing goal of neural data analysis has been to identify these variables and their mapping to neural activity. A productive and canonical approach has been to simply visualise neural ""tuning curves"" as a function of behaviour. In reality, significant discrepancies between behaviour and the true latent variables--such as an agent thinking of position Y whilst located at position X--distort and blur the tuning curves, decreasing their interpretability. To address this, latent variable models propose to learn the latent variable from data; these are typically expensive, hard to tune, or scale poorly, complicating their adoption. Here we propose SIMPL (Scalable Iterative Maximization of Population-coded Latents), an EM-style algorithm which iteratively optimises latent variables and tuning curves. SIMPL is fast, scalable and exploits behaviour as an initial condition to further improve convergence and identifiability. It can accurately recover latent variables in spatial and non-spatial tasks. When applied to a large hippocampal dataset SIMPL converges on smaller, more numerous, and more uniformly sized place fields than those based on behaviour, suggesting the brain may encode space with greater resolution than previously thought."
"BackgroundChemokines play critical roles in the recruitment and activation of immune cells in both homeostatic and pathologic conditions. Here, we examined chemokine ligand-receptor pairs to better understand the immunopathogenesis of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), a complex autoimmune connective tissue disorder.

ObjectivesOur objectives were to (1) characterize the cellular and proteomic constitution of interface dermatitis in CLE using blister biopsies, (2) map chemokine:ligand receptor pairs that govern recruitment of immune cells to form interface dermatitis in CLE, and (3) perform unbiased analyses in tandem on different clinical subtypes to identify novel genes and proteins underlying discoid versus subacute CLE.

MethodsWe used suction blister biopsies to measure cellular infiltrates with spectral flow cytometry in the interface dermatitis reaction, as well as 184 protein analytes in interstitial skin fluid using 96-plex immunoassay targeted proteomics. Flow and 96-plex immunoassay data concordantly demonstrated significant increases in T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs). We also performed spatial transcriptomics and spatial proteomics of punch biopsies using digital spatial profiling (DSP) technology on CLE skin and healthy margin controls to examine discreet locations within the tissue.

ResultsSpatial and 96-plex immunoassay data confirmed elevation of interferon (IFN) and IFN-inducible CXCR3 chemokine ligands. Comparing involved versus uninvolved keratinocytes in CLE samples revealed upregulation of essential inflammatory response genes in areas near interface dermatitis, including AIM2. 96-plex immunoassay data confirmed upregulation of Caspase 8, IL-18 which is the final product of AIM2 activation, and induced chemokines including CCL8 and CXCL6 in CLE lesional samples. Chemotaxis assays using PBMCs from healthy and CLE donors revealed that T cells are equally poised to respond to CXCR3 ligands, whereas CD14+CD16+ APC populations are more sensitive to CXCL6 via CXCR1 and CD14+ are more sensitive to CCL8 via CCR2.

ConclusionsTaken together, our data map a pathway from keratinocyte injury to lymphocyte recruitment in CLE via AIM2-Casp8-IL-18-CXCL6/CXCR1 and CCL8/CCR2, and IFNG/IFNL1-CXCL9/CXCL11-CXCR3, and identify potential novel biomarkers of disease.

A. Summary of fresh tissue blister biopsy studies demonstrating increases in HLADR+ cells in nonlesional lupus biopsies as assessed by flow cytometry, and increased CXCL6 and CCL8 as assessed by 96 plex immunoassay. Lesional lupus biopsies also demonstrated significant increases in T cells and CXCL9/10/11 production. B. Model of chemokine-directed formation of interface dermatitis in cutaneous lupus. 1. Whole transcriptome atlas (WTA) digital spatial profiling (DSP) revealed increased AIM2 in keratinocytes proximal to inflammation, which is reported to be induced by environmental triggers including UV light and toxins. We also noted increased Caspase 8 (Casp8) and IL18 at the protein level, which can be induced downstream of AIM2. Chemokines including CXCL6 and CCL8 can be induced downstream of IL18, explaining how CCL8 and CXCL6 might be induced. 2. Recruitment of myeloid cell first responders by CCL8 and CXCL6. CD14+CD16+ myeloid cells, which were recently described in nonlesional lupus skin, express CXCR1 and migrate towards CXCL6, whereas CD14+CD16-myeloid cells express more CCR2 and migrate towards CCL8. 3. The CXCR3 ligands CXCL9/10/11 are expressed by keratinocytes, but more strongly in CD45+ immune cell and T cell regions of interest (ROIs). 4. T cells express CXCR3 and migrate towards CXCL9 and to a greater extent CXCL11. 5. The recruited HLADR+ myeloid populations and T cells contribute to formation of interface dermatitis. Thus, we propose a model in which keratinocyte/myeloid crosstalk can reinforce chemokine systems to optimally recruit lymphocytes and other immune cells to form interface dermatitis.

Plain language summaryLupus skin rashes arise during flares, after exposure to medications or sunlight, or in response to other triggers of inflammation. To understand how white blood cells enter the skin to cause these rashes, we used new technologies to look at proteins that attract them into the skin. We found proteins that are expressed by skin cells in lesions that can recruit specific types of white blood cells that are thought to be the initiators of skin rashes. Once in the skin, these and other white blood cells can make additional proteins that bring in more and more cells. We hope that our findings will be used to test new topical treatments for lupus and other autoimmune skin rashes."
"Maintaining consistent quality in biopharmaceutical manufacturing is essential for producing high-quality complex biologics. Yet, current process analytical technologies (PAT) struggle to achieve rapid and highly accurate monitoring of small molecule critical process parameters and critical quality attributes. While Raman spectroscopy holds great promise as a highly sensitive and specific bioanalytical tool for PAT applications, its conventional implementation, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), is constrained by considerable temporal and spatial intensity fluctuations, limiting the achievable reproducibility and reliability. Herein, we introduce a deep learning-powered colloidal digital SERS platform to address these limitations. Rather than addressing the intensity fluctuations, the approach leverages their very stochastic nature, arising from highly dynamic analyte-nanoparticle interactions. By converting the temporally fluctuating SERS intensities into digital binary ""ON/OFF"" signals using a predefined intensity threshold by analyzing the characteristic SERS peak, this approach enables digital visualization of single-molecule events and significantly reduces false positives and background interferences. By further integrating colloidal digital SERS with deep learning, the applicability of this platform is significantly expanded and enables detection of a broad range of analytes, unlimited by the lack of characteristic SERS peaks for certain analytes. We further implement this approach for studying AMBIC 1.1, a chemically-defined, serum-free complete media for mammalian cell culture. The obtained highly accurate and reproducible results demonstrate the unique capabilities of this platform for rapid and precise cell culture media monitoring, paving the way for its widespread adoption and scaling up as a new PAT tool in biopharmaceutical manufacturing and biomedical diagnostics."
"CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized modern biology. Most CRISPR-Cas systems in use for biotechnological applications derive from cultivated bacteria, but evidence suggests that environmental microbiomes harbor a large untapped diversity of these systems. Yet, our understanding of which environmental and biological factors drive the prevalence of CRISPR-Cas systems in the oceans remains limited. A search for CRISPR-Cas systems was conducted among 176 globally-distributed marine microbial metagenomes from the Malaspina expedition, which sampled both free-living and particle-attached microbiomes with emphasis on the deep ocean. We show that CRISPR-Cas systems are proportionally more abundant among microbiomes from the deep ocean than in the photic layers and among free-living microbes compared to those attached to particles, reflecting the higher concentrations of archaea and their viruses in these habitats. We identified 1,146 CRISPR-cas loci, some of which displayed unique loci architectures. From these loci, a total of 48 Cas9 proteins were identified, many of which are potentially novel. These discoveries expand the scope of CRISPR-Cas diversity and point at the deep-sea as a rich reservoir of these resources, which helps guide future bioprospecting efforts."
"There is a growing understanding of how alternative splicing contributes to functional specialization and adaptation, especially in well-studied model organisms. However, its large-scale evolutionary dynamics remain poorly understood. Through a comparative analysis of alternative splicing across 1,494 species spanning the entire tree of life, this study integrates numerous lines of prior evidence to provide a unified view of alternative splicing. We propose a novel genome-scale metric designed to support cross-species comparison. Our findings indicate that alternative splicing is highly variable across lineages. While unicellular eukaryotes and prokaryotes display minimal splicing, mammals and birds exhibit the highest levels of alternative splicing. Despite sharing a conserved intron-rich genomic architecture, mammals and birds show considerable interspecies divergence in splicing activity. In contrast, plants display moderate levels of alternative splicing but exhibit high variability of genomic composition. Furthermore, a strong negative correlation is observed between alternative splicing and the proportion of coding content in genes, with the highest levels of alternative splicing observed in genomes containing approximately 50% intergenic DNA."
"The discovery of genes encoding the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) has enabled detailed exploration of its cell type-specific roles in the brain. LRRC8A (SWELL1) is the essential VRAC subunit. We observed seizure-induced, subunit-specific changes in microglial VRAC expression and investigated its function using conditional knockout (cKO) of LRRC8A in microglia. SWELL1 cKO mice exhibited a male-specific increase in kainate-induced seizure severity yet showed paradoxical neuroprotection against seizure-associated neuronal loss. Mechanistically, SWELL1 deletion led to a cell-autonomous reduction in microglial density and decreased release of VRAC-permeable neuroactive metabolites, including taurine, GABA, and glutamate in culture. Additionally, impaired phagocytic kinetics and reduced lysosomal biogenesis contributed to the observed neuroprotection. These findings reveal novel roles for microglial VRAC in regulating seizure outcomes and microglia-neuron interactions."
"An intriguing advancement in recent moral decision-making research suggests that people are more willing to sacrifice monetary gains to spare others from suffering than to spare themselves, yielding the hyperaltruistic tendency. Other studies, however, indicate an opposite egoistic bias in that subjects are less willing to harm themselves for the benefits of others than for their own benefits. These results highlight the delicate inner workings of moral decision and call for a mechanistic account of hyperaltruistic preference. We investigated the boundary conditions of hyperaltruism by presenting subjects with trade-off choices combing monetary gains and painful electric shocks, or, choices combing monetary losses and shocks. We first showed in study 1 that switching the decision context from gains to losses effectively eliminated the hyperaltruistic preference and the decision context effect was associated with the altered relationship between subjects instrumental harm (IH) trait attitudes and their relative pain sensitivities. In the pre-registered study 2, we tested whether oxytocin, a neuropeptide linked to parochial altruism, might restore the context-dependent hyperaltruistic preference. We found that oxytocin increased subjects reported levels of framing the task as harming (vs. helping) others, which mediated the correlation between IH and relative pain sensitivities. Thus, the loss decision context and oxytocin diminished and restored the mediation effect of subjective harm framing, respectively. Our results help to elucidate the psychological processes underpinning the contextual specificity of hyperaltruism and carry implications in promoting prosocial interactions in our society."
"Lab studies of bacteria usually focus on cells in spatially-extended, nutrient-replete settings, such as in liquid cultures and on agar surfaces. By contrast, many biological and environmental settings--ranging from mucus in the body to ocean sediments and the soil beneath our feet--feature multicellular bacterial populations that are confined to tight spots where essential metabolic substrates (e.g., oxygen) are scarce. What influence does such confinement have on a bacterial population? Here, we address this question by studying suspensions of motile Escherichia coli confined to quasi two-dimensional (2D) droplets. We find that when the droplet size and cell concentration are both large enough, the initially-uniform suspension spatially self-organizes into a concentrated, immotile inner ""core"" that coexists with a more dilute, highly-motile surrounding ""shell"". By simultaneously measuring cell concentration, oxygen concentration, and motility-generated fluid flow, we show that this behavior arises from the interplay between oxygen transport through the droplet from its boundary, uptake by the cells, and corresponding changes in their motility in response to oxygen variations. Furthermore, we use theory and simulations to develop quantitative principles describing this interplay--establishing a bio-physical framework that unifies all our experimental observations. Our work thereby sheds new light on the rich collective behaviors that emerge for bacterial populations, and other forms of chemically-reactive living and active matter, in confined environments, and provides a way to predict and control these behaviors more broadly."
"Movement flexibility and automaticity are necessary to successfully navigate different environments. When encountering difficult terrains such as a muddy trail, we can change how we step almost immediately so that we can continue walking. This flexibility comes at a cost since we initially must pay deliberate attention to how we are moving. Gradually, after a few minutes on the trail, stepping becomes automatic so that we do not need to think about our movements. Canonical theory indicates that different adaptive motor learning mechanisms confer these essential properties to movement: explicit control confers rapid flexibility, while forward model recalibration confers automaticity. Here we uncover a distinct mechanism of treadmill walking adaptation - an automatic stimulus-response mapping - that confers both properties to movement. The mechanism is flexible as it learns stepping patterns that can be rapidly changed to suit a range of treadmill configurations. It is also automatic as it can operate without deliberate control or explicit awareness by the participants. Our findings reveal a tandem architecture of forward model recalibration and automatic stimulus-response mapping mechanisms for walking, reconciling different findings of motor adaptation and perceptual realignment."
"Ubiquitin (Ub) cooperation with other post-translational modifications provides a tiered opportunity for protein regulation. Small modifications to Ub such as phosphorylation, acetylation, or ADP-ribosylation have varying impacts on signaling. The Deltex family of E3 ligases was previously implicated in the ubiquitylation of ADP-ribose (ADPr) and ADPr-containing macromolecules. Our previous work found ester-linked mono-ADPr ubiquitylation (MARUbylation) on PARP7 and PARP10 in cells and that this mark is extended with K11 polyUb. We previously screened for E3 ligases that interact with PARP7 through three different approaches and identified six candidates, including the Deltex family member DTX2. One of these hits, RNF114, interacts with various other PARPs, leading us to hypothesize that RNF114 binds to sites of MARUbylation and extends K11 polyUb. Here, we show that DTX2 generates the initial MARUbe on PARP7 in cells, which depends on PARP7 catalytic activity. The MARUbe on PARP7 is extended with K11 polyUb by RNF114. To investigate the mechanism of RNF114 reader/writer function, we developed a click chemistry-inspired chemoenzymatic approach to create a novel fluorescent Ub-ADPr probe for studying its interaction with RNF114. Strikingly, we found that RNF114 has a weak affinity for ADPr and Ub separately but explicitly recognizes the linkage between Ub and ADPr present in MARUbylated species. We used AlphaFold3 modeling to examine the mechanisms of Ub-ADPr recognition and K11-linked polyUb extension by RNF114. We identified a tandem Di19-UIM module in RNF114 as a MARUbe-binding domain (MUBD), thus providing a reader function that interfaces with K11-specific writer activity. Finally, we described a small family of MUBD-containing E3 ligases that demonstrate preference for Ub-ADPr, which we call MARUbe-Targeted Ligases (MUTLs)."
"Pyrophosphate is a byproduct of numerous cellular reactions that use ATP or other nucleoside triphosphates to synthesize DNA, RNA, protein, and other molecules. Its degradation into monophosphate is thus crucial for the survival and proliferation of all life forms. The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum encodes two classes of pyrophosphatases to hydrolyze pyrophosphate. The first consists of P. falciparum proton pumping vacuolar pyrophosphatases (PfVP1 and PfVP2), which localize to the parasites subcellular membranes and work as proton pumps. The second includes P. falciparum soluble pyrophosphatases (PfsPPases), which have not been well characterized. Interestingly, the gene locus of PfsPPase encodes two isoforms, PfsPPase1 (PF3D7_0316300.1) and PfsPPase2 (PF3D7_0316300.2). PfsPPase2 contains a 51- amino acid organellar localization peptide that is absent in PfsPPase1. Here, we combine reverse genetics and biochemical approaches to identify the localization of PfsPPase1 and PfsPPase2 and elucidate their individual functions. We show that PfsPPases are essential for the asexual blood stage. While PfsPPase1 solely localizes to the cytoplasm, PfsPPase2 exhibits multiple localizations including the mitochondrion, the apicoplast, and, to a lesser extent, the cytoplasm. Our data suggest that P. falciparum has taken a unique evolutionary trajectory in pyrophosphate metabolism by utilizing a leader sequence to direct sPPases to the mitochondrion and apicoplast. This differs from model eukaryotes as they generally encode multiple sPPases at distinct genetic loci to facilitate pyrophosphate degradation in cytosolic and organellar compartments. Our study highlights PfsPPases as promising targets for the development of novel antimalarial drugs."
"When intercepting a moving target, responses are systematically biased toward the time of impact from the previous trial. This phenomenon, known as serial dependence, relies on a memory mechanism that remains poorly understood. In interceptive tasks, multiple stimulus features -- such as speed, time, or motor responses -- can guide behavior on the current trial and may be stored to influence subsequent trials. Here, we examined how memory decays over short inter-trial intervals (Experiment 1, N = 23) and whether interleaved tasks influence serial dependence (Experiment 2, N = 28). Participants performed either a temporal reproduction task or a speed judgment task, designed to compete for temporal and speed-processing resources, respectively. Our findings reveal that serial dependence persists across all inter-trial durations and remains unaffected by intervening tasks. While serial dependence was neither reduced nor eliminated, variations in responses were partially influenced by prior temporal reproductions from the interfering task. These results suggest that serial dependence in visuomotor tasks is robust to both the passage of time and external interference, though task responses may be subtly modulated by preceding temporal reproductions."
"Spermatogenesis is a key developmental process underlying the origination of newly evolved genes. However, rapid cell type-specific transcriptomic divergence of the Drosophila germline has posed a significant technical barrier for comparative single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) studies. By quantifying a surprisingly strong correlation between species- and cell type-specific divergence in three closely related Drosophila species, we apply a new statistical procedure to identify a core set of 198 genes that are highly predictive of cell type identity while remaining robust to species-specific differences that span over 25-30 million years of evolution. We then utilize cell type classifications based on the 198-gene set to show how transcriptional divergence in cell type increases throughout spermatogenic developmental time. After validating these cross-species cell type classifications using RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and imaging, we then investigate the influence of genome organization on the molecular evolution of spermatogenesis vis-a-vis transcriptional bursting. We first show altering transcriptional burst size contributes to pre-meiotic transcription and altering bursting frequency contributes to post-meiotic expression. We then report global differences in autosomal vs. X chromosomal transcription may arise in a developmental stage preceding full testis organogenesis by showing evolutionarily conserved decreases in X-linked transcription bursting kinetics in all examined somatic and germline cell types. Finally, we provide evidence supporting the cultivator model of de novo gene origination by demonstrating how the appearance of newly evolved testis-specific transcripts potentially provides short-range regulation of neighboring genes transcriptional bursting properties during key stages of spermatogenesis.

Significance StatementUnderstanding the divergence and evolution of novel genes and expression is an essential question in evolutionary biology. However, rapid transcriptomic divergence in tissues such as testis has significantly hindered comparative single-cell RNA-Seq studies and understanding of the rapidly evolving components of the cell types. Here, we provide a novel strategy that does not rely on preexisting marker genes for cell type identity to overcome the challenge. We found that genome organization affects expressional evolution through transcriptional bursting dynamics. Our results also support the cultivator model of de novo gene origination--a model emphasizing the genomic environment in shaping novel gene origination--by illustrating how newly evolved transcripts alter the transcriptional bursting kinetics of neighboring genes."
"During infections, vertebrates develop stereotypic symptoms such as elevated body temperature, reduced appetite, and lethargy. These changes, collectively known as sickness syndrome, are orchestrated by the brain in response to immune mediators released during systemic inflammation. While the roles of subcortical regions, including the hypothalamus and brainstem nuclei, in regulating sickness symptoms are well established, the contribution of the neocortex to the encoding and modulation of the sick state remains less well understood. We examined the neuronal correlates of sickness in the neocortex of awake mice following a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a well-characterized mediator of sickness. Behavioral analysis revealed that PGE2 elicited a rapid and robust sickness response, characterized by fever, slower locomotion, quiescence, anorexia, and eye squinting. Whole-brain Fos mapping showed that PGE2 generates a distinct neural activation pattern encompassing much of the interoceptive network. Electrophysiological recordings using Neuropixel probes in awake mice revealed that neuronal population dynamics in the insular cortex (IC) and the primary somatosensory cortex (SSp), two regions involved in body state representation, encode sickness-related information, such as body temperature, walking velocity, grooming, and eye squinting. However, unlike SSp, ongoing neuronal activity in IC exhibited a better decoding performance for an integrated measure of sickness rather than individual symptoms. Together, these results suggest that PGE2 induces a coordinated physiological and behavioral response akin to a sick state, which is preferentially encoded in the IC."
"For the first time, we assembled two highly continuous, completely gap-free reference genomes of the Rubus subgenus: Rubus hirsutus Thunb.  Penglei (XMM) and Rubus eustephanos Focke ex Diels  Dahongpao (DHP), which are widely distributed in southern China with similar phenotypic traits (Figures 1A, 1B, and Figure S1), yet ripe fruits display distinct sugar accumulation levels (Table S1), making them ideal candidates for investigating the mechanisms underlying sugar accumulation in the Rubus genus. The XMM (213.53 Mb, 28,204 genes) and DHP (218.26 Mb, 28,569 genes) genomes exhibit close evolutionary relationships, diverging approximately 3.21 Mya. Comparative genomics identified extensive synteny, interspecific structural variations (translocations, inversions, segmental duplications), and presence/absence variation (PAV). Using Hi-C interaction heatmaps and Sanger sequencing, we validated interspecific structural inversions. Additionally, we identified a sugar transporter gene (MFS1), which is present in XMM but absent in DHP. Combined analysis of the gene family expansion/contraction and transcriptome identified two conserved key genes (RhSTP13 and RhSTP7) associated with sugar accumulation in Rubus genus and displayed distinct roles through transient expression assay. To facilitate functional genomics study, we also established a comprehensive Rubus database, RubusDB, a freely accessible repository consolidating all genomic, transcriptomic and phenotypic data of Rubus genus. These findings provide a foundational framework for elucidating the genetic basis of sugar accumulation, genome diversification, and trait improvement in Rubus species.

"Bacteria colonize surfaces through complex mechanisms of surface sensing. Pili are dynamic bacterial appendages that play an important role in this process. In Caulobacter crescentus, tension on retracting, surface-bound pili triggers the rapid synthesis of the adhesive holdfast, which permanently attaches cells to surfaces. However, the detailed mechanisms of pilus-mediated surface sensing are unclear. In this study, we used a genetic screen to isolate mutants with altered pilus activity to identify genes that may be involved in pilus-mediated surface-sensing. This screen identified cpaL, whose deletion led to reduced piliation levels, and surprisingly, a threefold increase in surface adhesion due to increased holdfast production. To understand this finding, we compared holdfast synthesis in wild-type and cpaL mutant cells under conditions that block pilus retraction. While this treatment increased holdfast production in wild-type cells by triggering the surface-sensing pathway, no increase was observed in the cpaL mutant, suggesting that mutation of cpaL maximally stimulates surface-sensing. Furthermore, when the cpaL mutant was grown in a medium that blocks the surface sensing pathway, cells exhibited decreased surface attachment and holdfast production, consistent with a role for CpaL in pilus-dependent surface sensing in C. crescentus. To better understand the function of CpaL, we analyzed its predicted structure, which suggested that CpaL is a minor pilin fused to a mechanosensitive von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain that could be accommodated at the pilus tip. These results collectively position CpaL as a strong candidate for a mechanosensory element in pilus-mediated surface sensing.

ImportanceSurface sensing is a crucial mechanism that allows bacteria to change their behaviors to adapt to life on a surface. Surface recognition by bacteria is the initial step toward surface colonization and biofilm formation. In Caulobacter crescentus, tight adherence (Tad) pili play a key role in surface recognition and adaptation. However, the mechanism of pilus-mediated surface sensing and the proteins that influence this process remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that CpaL, a potential pilus tip mechanosensory protein, could be the major element of Tad pilus-mediated surface attachment and colonization in C. crescentus. CpaL plays an important role in the regulation of holdfast synthesis and production upon surface contact. By identifying CpaL as a key player in the process of surface recognition, our work offers valuable insights into the mechanisms of bacterial adhesion."
"In the pursuit of sustainable  green energy generation, [FeFe]-hydrogenases have attracted significant attention due to their ability to catalyze hydrogen production. However, the sensitivity of these enzymes to O2 is a major obstacle for their application as biocatalysts in energy conversion technologies. In the search for an O2-stable [FeFe]-hydrogenase, we identified the hydrogenase ToHydA from Thermosediminibacter oceani that belongs to the rarely characterized Group B (M2a) [FeFe]-hydrogenases. Our findings demonstrate that ToHydA exhibits remarkable O2-stability, even under prolonged O2 exposure. By characterizing site-directed mutagenesis variants, we found that the highly conserved proton-transporting cysteine protects H-cluster from O2-induced degradation by forming Hinact state. The additional cysteine residue in the TSCCCP motif of ToHydA, a feature unique to Group B (M2a) [FeFe]-hydrogenases, enhances the flexibility of that motif and facilitates the formation of the Hinact state. Moreover, ToHydA possesses unique features, including the formation of an unusual Hinact resting state that distinguishes the enzyme from other [FeFe]-hydrogenases. Our atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveal a previously unrecognized cluster of hydrophobic residues centered around the proton-transporting cysteine-bearing loop. This structural feature appears to be a common molecular characteristic in hydrogenases that form the O2-protected Hinact state. By exploiting these molecular features of ToHydA, future research can aim to rationally design hydrogenases that combine high catalytic activity with enhanced O2 stability, to develop more efficient and durable catalysts.

"The Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans) represents the only European Pteromyini species. Thus, it is biogeographically unique due to its specialised anatomy and biology as a volant rodent. As a result of habitat fragmentation and destruction, Siberian flying squirrels experience severe and ongoing population declines throughout most of their distribution. While considered Least Concern throughout their immense Eurasian distribution, this species is red-listed as Vulnerable and even Critically Endangered in parts of its range. More knowledge about the population structure and overall biology is needed to improve conservation efforts for this umbrella and flagship species of old-growth boreal forests. Here, we present the first chromosome-level genome assembly of any Pteromyini, represented by P. volans (Uoulu_pteVol_1.0). The final assembly has a total length of 2.85 Gbp in 19 chromosome-scale scaffolds with only minor differences in the chromosomal structure compared to other Sciuridae. All chromosome-scale scaffolds show indications for telomeres at both ends; the N50 value and busco as well as k-mer completeness scores are high with 157.39 Mbp and 97 - 99 %, respectively, indicating near T2T quality of the assembly. Based on whole-genome data from 17 rodent species, P. volans clusters according to known evolutionary relationships. Additionally, we present a new 16,511 bp long mitogenome unveiling differences from known conspecific mitogenomes. We propose the utility of the new reference genome for further research and development of conservation-applied genetic methods."
"Hyphal growth is strongly associated with virulence in the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. While hyphal transcriptional networks have been the subject of intense study, relatively little is known about post-transcriptional regulation. Previous work reported that P-Body (PB) factors Dhh1 and Edc3 were required for C. albicans virulence and filamentation, suggesting an essential role for post-transcriptional regulation of these processes. However, the molecular roles of these factors have not been determined. To further study the function of PB factors in filamentation, we generated homozygous deletions of DHH1 and EDC3 in diverse prototrophic clinical strains using transient CRISPR-Cas9. Homozygous DHH1 deletion strongly impaired growth, altered filamentation, and exhibited unusual colony morphology in response to heat stress in five strain backgrounds. Using RNA-seq, we found DHH1 deletion disrupts the regulation of thousands of genes under both yeast and hyphal growth conditions in SC5314 and P57055. This included upregulation of many stress response genes in the absence of external stress, similar to deletion of the S. cerevisiae DHH1 homolog. In contrast, we found EDC3 was not required for heat tolerance or filamentation in diverse strains. These results support a model in which DHH1, but not EDC3, represses hyphal stress response transcripts in yeast and remodels the transcriptome during filamentation. Our work supports distinct requirements for specific mRNA decay factors, bolstering evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of filamentation in C. albicans.

Author summaryIn the dimorphic fungal pathogen C. albicans, the hyphal phenotype strongly correlates with pathogenicity. While transcriptional control of hyphal growth has been extensively studied, comparatively little is known about post-transcriptional regulation of this significant morphological shift. PB factors are associated with mRNA decay and translational repression. Here we investigate the roles of two PB factors in growth, filamentation, and gene expression. Although deletion of PB factor EDC3 did not impact growth or filamentation, dhh1{Delta}/{Delta} had greatly impaired growth and heat tolerance as well as unusual hyphal phenotypes in multiple clinical isolate strains. Additionally, we found that the transcriptomes of SC5314 and P57055 dhh1{Delta}/{Delta} yeast and hyphae were highly dysregulated. The extensive transcriptomic impacts of the absence of Dhh1 correlated with our phenotypic findings. Stress-associated genes were induced under non-stress conditions and the filamentation response was blunted under physiologically relevant in vitro conditions. We demonstrate that mRNA decay factors play distinct roles in regulating C. albicans morphology and that Dhh1 contributes to environmentally appropriate expression of the stress response and hyphal growth."
"Neutrophils are the major cellular constituent of blood leukocytes and play a central role in the inflammatory response, producing an array of destructive molecules and antimicrobial proteases that characterise the cells as front-line defenders of the innate immune system, crucial to host defence. It is now appreciated that neutrophils produce and respond to a variety of inflammatory signals and are able to regulate both the innate and adaptive immune responses. However, the mechanisms by which neutrophils respond to different inflammatory signals to regulate their own function and the functions of other immune cells are incompletely defined. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing with bioinformatics analysis of healthy human neutrophils exposed for 1h to a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines. GM-CSF and TNF induced significant changes in expression in the most transcripts including activation of genes regulating apoptosis and genes encoding cytokines and chemokines that can drive the differentiation and activation of CD4 T cells. Stimulation of neutrophils with G-CSF, IFN, IFN{gamma}, IL-1{beta}, or IL-8 resulted in expression of discrete gene sets and differential activation of signalling pathways including changes in cell adhesion and migration, immune receptor expression, apoptosis, and production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. This work defines the differential gene expression patterns in neutrophils exposed to different regulatory cytokines. This is important in both increasing our understanding of the role of neutrophils in driving innate and adaptive immune responses and, importantly, for deconvoluting the neutrophil gene expression signatures observed in inflammatory diseases."
"Transformers pre-trained on single-cell transcriptomic data have recently been applied to a series of tasks, earning them the title of foundation models. As all currently published models in this class employ vastly different pre-training strategies, it is impossible to determine which practices drive their success (or failure). Here, we present a large-scale study of pre-training components for single-cell transcriptomic transformers: bento-sc (BENchmarking Transformer-Obtained Single-Cell representations). By isolating (and tuning) parts of the pre-training scheme one by one, we define best practices for single-cell language model (scLM) construction. While comparisons with baselines indicate that scLMs do not yet offer the generational leap in prediction performances promised by many foundation models, we identify key design choices leading to their improved performance. Namely, the best scLMs are obtained by: (1) minimally processing counts at the input level, (2) using reconstruction losses that exploit known count distributions, (3) masking (up to high rates), and (4) combining different pre-training tasks/losses. All code supporting this study is distributed on PyPI and is packaged under: https://github.com/gdewael/bento-sc."
"Disordered proteins and domains often assemble into condensates with polyanionic nucleic acids, primarily via charge complementarity, regulating numerous cellular functions. However, the assembly mechanisms associated with the other abundant and ubiquitous, anionic, stress-response regulating polymer, polyphosphate (polyP), is less understood. Here, we employ the intrinsically disordered DNA binding domain (DBD) of cytidine repressor (CytR) from E.coli to study the nature of assembly processes with polyP and DNA. CytR forms metastable liquid-like condensates with polyP and DNA, while undergoing liquid-to-solid transition in the former and dissolving in the latter. On mutationally engineering the ensemble to exhibit more or less structure and dimensions than the WT, the assembly process with polyP is directed to either condensates with partial time-dependent dissolution or spontaneous aggregation, respectively. On the other hand, the CytR variants form only liquid-like but metastable droplets with DNA which dissolve within a few hours. Polyphosphate induces large secondary-structure changes, with two of the mutants adopting polyproline II-like structures within droplets, while DNA has only minimal structural effects. Our findings reveal how polyphosphate can more efficiently discern conformational heterogeneity in the starting protein ensemble, its structure, and compactness, with broad implications in assembly mechanisms involving polyP and stress response in bacterial systems."
"BackgroundAnimal studies established that the locus coeruleus (LC) plays important roles in sleep and wakefulness regulation. Whether it contributes to sleep variability in humans is not yet established. Here, we investigated if the in vivo activity of the LC is related to the variability in the quality of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep.

MethodsWe assessed the LC activity of 34 healthy younger ([~]22y) and 18 older ([~]61y) individuals engaged in bottom-up and top-down cognitive tasks using 7-Tesla functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We further recorded their sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) to evaluate associations between LC fMRI measures and REM sleep EEG metrics.

ResultsTheta oscillation energy during REM sleep was positively associated with LC response in the top-down task. In contrast, REM sleep theta energy was negatively associated with LC activity in older individuals during the bottom-up task. Importantly, sigma oscillations power immediately preceding a REM sleep episode was positively associated with LC activity in the top-down task.

ConclusionsLC activity during wakefulness was related to REM sleep intensity and to a transient EEG change preceding REM sleep, a feature causally related to LC activity in animal studies. The associations depend on the cognitive task, suggesting that a balanced level of LC tonic activity during wakefulness is required for optimal expression of REM sleep. The findings may have implications for the high prevalence of sleep complaints reported in aging and for disorders such as insomnia, Alzheimers, and Parkinsons disease, for which the LC may play pivotal roles through sleep."
"The actin cortex, a thin layer of actomyosin network beneath the plasma membrane, regulates various cell functions by generating active forces and inducing membrane deformations, including blebs. Although upstream signaling is involved in regulating cell shape, the extent to which downstream actomyosin molecules can control the shape remains elusive. Here, using a minimal reconstituted system with a combination of agent-based computational model, we show that while actin-membrane coupling strength determines the magnitude of membrane deformation, its balance with actin network connectivity governs the bleb initiation mechanism, either by detachment of the cortex from the membrane or by rupture of the cortex. This balance also regulates whether single or multiple blebs form. Furthermore, both experiments and simulations suggest that not only the dense cortical network but also the sparse volume-spanning network actively contributes to regulating bleb number. These findings provide mechanical insights into how cells tune actin network organization to control their shape."
"CRISPR-Cas systems provide adaptive immunity against phage infection in prokaryotes using an RNA-guided complex that recognizes complementary foreign nucleic acids. Different types of CRISPR-Cas systems have been identified that differ in their mechanism of defense. Upon infection, Type III CRISPR-Cas systems employ the Cas10 complex to find phage transcripts and synthesize cyclic oligo-adenylate (cOA) messengers. These ligands bind and activate CARF immune effectors that cause cell toxicity to prevent the completion of the viral lytic cycle. Here we investigated two proteins containing an N-terminal haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) phosphatase domain followed by four predicted transmembrane helices and a C-terminal CARF domain, which we named Chp. We show that, in vivo, Chp localizes to the bacterial membrane and that its activation induces a growth arrest, leads to a depletion of ATP and IMP and prevents phage propagation during the type III CRISPR-Cas response. In vitro, the CARF domain of Chp binds cyclic tetra-adenylates and the HAD phosphatase domain dephosphorylates dATP, ATP and IMP. Our findings extend the range of molecular mechanisms employed by CARF effectors to defend prokaryotes against phage infection."
"Pain drives self-protective behaviour, and evolutionary theories suggest it acts over different timescales to serve distinct functions. Whilst phasic pain provides a teaching signal to drive avoidance of new injury, tonic pain is argued to support recuperative behaviour, for instance by reducing motivational vigour. We test this hypothesis in an immersive virtual reality EEG foraging task where subjects harvested fruit in a forest: some fruit elicited brief phasic pain to the grasping hand, and this reduced choice probability. Simultaneously, tonic pressure pain to the contralateral upper arm was associated with reduced action velocities. This could be explained by a free-operant computational framework that formalises and quantifies the function of tonic and phasic pain in terms of motivational vigour and decision value, and model parameters correlated with EEG responses. Overall, the results show how tonic and phasic pain subserve distinct objective motivational functions that support harm minimisation during ongoing adaptive behaviour."
"Landscape-scale ecological restoration is a key strategy for halting and reversing biodiversity decline. However, ensuring the long-term sustainability of restoration efforts requires guiding the recovery of complex ecological systems with many interdependent species at a landscape scale. Due to these challenges, our understanding of recovery trajectories remains limited. Using experiments and metapopulation models, we explore how the spatial configuration of communities and food web complexity jointly influence species recovery at different spatial scales. We find that the number and spatial placement of communities affects the colonisation of empty habitat patches, but does not influence population recovery in patches where communities are introduced. Food web complexity reduces the recovery of lower trophic levels, both at population and metapopulation scales. However, this negative effect may be partially mitigated at higher levels of food web complexity. Our results demonstrate that the joint consideration of spatial configuration and species interactions could enhance the effectiveness of restoration actions."
"Neuronal architecture laid out during embryogenesis persists lifelong, ensuring normal nervous system function. However, the mechanisms underlying the long-term maintenance of neuronal organization remain largely unknown. We previously uncovered that the conserved extracellular matrix protein MIG-6/papilin impacts collagen IV remodeling and neuronal maintenance, such that disruption of MIG-6/papilin leads to a collagen IV fibrotic state and altered tissue biomechanics, thereby stabilizing neuronal architecture. Here, we combine incisive molecular genetics and in vivo quantitative imaging to determine how this mig-6-dependent fibrotic phenotype is modulated, by investigating the implication of the TGF-{beta} pathway, which is well known to regulate fibrosis in mammals. Our findings highlight a mechanism whereby the interplay between MIG-6/papilin and the TGF-{beta} pathway regulates ECM composition and neuronal maintenance, with MIG-6/papilin acting as a positive regulator of TGF-{beta} signaling. This work provides key insights into the molecular basis of sustaining neuronal architecture and offers a foundation for understanding age-related neurodegenerative and fibrotic conditions."
"Aims/HypothesisThe importance for normal insulin secretion of ceramide synthesis is unclear. De novo ceramide synthesis requires serine palmitoyl transferase, SPT2, encoded by Sptl2.

MethodsWe generated {beta}-cell-selective Sptl2 null mice by crossing animals with floxed alleles to mice expressing Cre recombinase from the Ins1 locus. Metabolic phenotyping, transcriptomic, functional analyses and histology were performed using standard approaches.

ResultsIslets from Sptlc2{Delta}Ins1 mice displayed marked alterations in ceramide and sphingomyelin levels: ceramide content: p=0.016 and p=0.109; sphingomyelin content: p=0.016 and p=0.004 in Sptlc2{Delta}Ins1 vs Sptlc2CTL mice under regular and high fat diet, respectively, despite compensatory increases in the expression of enzymes in the salvage and sphingomyelinase pathways. Correspondingly, profound abnormalities were observed in glucose-regulated insulin secretion and glucose tolerance in vivo, both on a regular chow and high fat diet. These changes were associated with a drastic ([~]80%) lowering in {beta}-cell numbers, and a more minor increase in delta cell numbers. They were also preserved in animals maintained on a ketogenic diet, consistent with a cell autonomous effect on the {beta}-cell. Despite normal glucose-regulated intracellular calcium dynamics and insulin secretion, marked transcriptomic changes were observed in Sptlc2{Delta}Ins1 mouse islets, with affected GO terms including lysosome organisation and regulation of autophagy. Consistent with roles for compromised SPT2 function in diseased {beta}-cells, Sptl2 expression in Balbc and DBA2J mouse islets was lowered by a high fat-diet. Moreover, SPTLC2 mRNA tended to be lower, and SPTLC1 mRNA was significantly decreased, in islets from human subjects with type 2 diabetes versus normoglycemic individuals.

ConclusionsPreserved de novo ceramide synthesis is required to maintain normal {beta}-cell mass and thus insulin secretion in mice. Therapeutic approaches which seek to target this process systemically using pharmacological SPT2 inhibitors should thus be treated with caution.

Research in contextO_ST_ABS- What is already known about this subject?C_ST_ABSCeramides are key components of sphingolipid metabolism.

Excess ceramide levels contribute to lipotoxicity and {beta}-cell apoptosis.

-cell-restricted deletion of Cers2, which is responsible for the synthesis of very long ceramide chains, alters the insulin content of pancreatic islets and modifies glucose tolerance. Deletion of Cers 5 or 6, responsible for the synthesis of the long chains, has no effect.

- What is the key question?What is the importance of de novo ceramide synthesis in {beta}-cells for the normal regulation of insulin production and glucose homeostasis?

- What are the new findings?Inhibition of the de novo ceramide synthesis pathway in {beta}-cells, achieved by selective deletion of Sptlc2, encoding subunit 2 of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) enzyme, induces a major alteration of glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. This is accompanied by a drastic reduction in {beta}-cell mass and islet insulin content.

The remaining islets of Sptlc2{Delta}Ins1 display normal glucose-regulated intracellular calcium dynamics and insulin secretion despite imbalances in ceramide and sphingomyelin levels and substantial transcriptomic changes.

Expression of SPTLC1, which encodes the other subunit of the SPT heterodimer, is reduced in islets from humans with type 2 diabetes, and a trend is observed towards lowered SPTLC2 expression.

Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of de novo ceramide synthesis for normal {beta}-cell survival and function

- How might this impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?By suppressing insulin production, global blockade or inhibition of SPT2, achieved with pharmacological approaches which seek to rescue insulin sensitivity in T2D, may be deleterious for glucose tolerance."
"Some of the most widely recognized spatial scaling relationships in ecology include the species-area, the abundance-occupancy, and the community compositional similarity-geographic distance relationships. These patterns have been shown to emerge from common mechanisms, such as habitat heterogeneity and colonization-extinction dynamics, and are predicted by various ecological models and theories, including Island Biogeography, Metapopulation theory, and Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography. These patterns have been studied in microbial communities at large-scale, but studies at fine grain and small extent are rare, despite at a fine-scale, emerging patterns can be tested with a higher resolution. In this study, we explored these macroecological patterns in bacterial communities inhabiting hot springs mats, which have been shown to exhibit fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in fundamental environmental parameters such as temperature. In three different localities, we sampled a grid with a heterogeneous temperature at a fine-scale, a small extent (approximately 150 cm2), and fine grain (each containing 30 cells spaced about 1 or 2 cm apart). Our findings revealed sublinear scaling for the species-area relationship, with similar parameters across localities, indicating a low rate of spatial species turnover. For the abundance-occupancy relationship, we observed increasing trends, meaning that species that occupied more patches were, on average, more abundant. Additionally, we identified a decay in community compositional similarity with distance in two of the localities, though with low parameter values, indicating minimal geographic isolation at this scale. These results are consistent with different models that predict that spatial ecological patterns arise from spatial heterogeneity, as different species can partition their niches in space and constitute an example of predictable spatial patterns at a fine scale."
"Impaired brain function is restored following injury through dynamic processes that involve synaptic plasticity. This restoration is supported by the brains inherent modular organization, which promotes functional separation and redundancy. However, it remains unclear how the modular structure interacts with synaptic plasticity, most notably in the form of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), to define the damage response and recovery efficiency. In this work, we numerically modeled the response and recovery to damage of a neuronal network in vitro bearing a modular structure. Consistent with the in vitro observations, the in silico numerical model effectively captured the decline and subsequent recovery of spontaneous activity following the injury. We revealed that the modular structure confers robustness to injury, minimizes the decrease in neuronal activity, and promotes recovery via STDP. Finally, using the reservoir computing framework, we show that information representation in the neuronal network improves with the recovery of synchronous activity. Our work provides an experimental-numerical platform for predicting recovery in damaged neuronal networks and may help developing effective models for brain injury."
"The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is frequently dysregulated in cancer and controls key cellular processes such as survival, proliferation, metabolism and growth. Protein glycosylation is essential for proper protein folding and is also often deregulated in cancer. Cancer cells depend on increased protein folding to sustain oncogene-driven proliferation rates. The N-glycosyltransferase asparagine-linked glycosylation 3 homolog (ALG3), a rate-limiting enzyme during glycan biosynthesis, catalyzes the addition of the first mannose to glycans in an alpha-1,3 linkage. Here we show that ALG3 is phosphorylated downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway in both growth factor-stimulated cells and PI3K/AKT hyperactive cancer cells. AKT directly phosphorylates ALG3 in the amino terminal region at Ser11/Ser13. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated depletion of ALG3 leads to improper glycan formation and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress, the unfolded protein response, and impaired cell proliferation. Phosphorylation of ALG3 at Ser11/Ser13 is required for glycosylation of cell surface receptors EGFR, HER3 and E-cadherin. These findings provide a direct link between PI3K/AKT signaling and protein glycosylation in cancer cells."
"Accurate analysis of cell atlas and gene expression in biological tissues using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) is dependent on the quality of source material, and post-mortem interval (PMI) is one of the major sources of variation in RNA quality. Although the use of RNA-degraded tissues in transcriptome analysis remains controversial, such samples are sometimes the sole means to address specific questions. Current studies on the impact of PMI on transcriptome data are limited to large-scale RNA-seq, which ignores cellular heterogeneity. Thus, deciphering the non-cell-autonomous effects caused by PMI is imperative for understanding the cellular and molecular disruption it elicits. Here, we investigated the impact of PMI on cellular components and gene expression using snRNA-seq data from mouse brain tissues of post-mortem. We collected samples that were allowed to decay for varying amounts of time at 25 C prior to snRNA-seq, covering the entire range of RIN values. The different effects on the PMI to the degradation rate of mRNA and rRNA within nuclei, and the mRNA presented a more stable state. Multi-channel analysis revealed the preferential transient depletion oligodendrocytes and OPCs with increasing PMI. In addition, a rapid widespread overregulation of ribosomal transient recruitment to protein (RP) genes in various cells, and reached a plateau at PMI of 36h. Although state depletion of neuronal cells was not detected, we reported significant upregulation of PMI-dependent RP genes in its subpopulations and their cell loss. Moreover, RP genes showed the greatest differential expression in the subpopulations with greater cell perturbation, and we speculated that aberrant expression of these genes might be associated with cell death. In this study, we systematically investigated the changes in the transcriptome profile of brain tissue induced by PMI at single-cell resolution, and revealed one of the important factors that might be responsible for the changes. In addition, our data complemented a possible explanation for the changes in the cellular state of brain tissue induced by postmortem hypoxia-ischemia, and provided a reference for transcriptome studies of RNA degradation samples."
"O_LIPlant-soil feedback (PSF) theory leverages the increasingly recognized ecological significance of microbiomes to provide insight into plant coexistence. However, PSF theory generally assumes that microbiomes have static composition and properties. In reality, plant communities are thought to experience high rates of colonization by new microbial strains.
C_LIO_LIHere we use a PSF model to study the conditions under which soil-associated fungi invade a community of two plant species and their associated microbiomes at different stages of assembly. We manipulate fungal colonization timing, initial plant and microbiome evenness, and properties of all actors, then analyze the resulting community structure.
C_LIO_LIMicrobial invasion is most successful early in community assembly. However, invasion outcomes are highly variable across colonization timing. We derive an expression showing that the net support for the invader by the plants determines invasion success. When successful, the invader disrupts the negative feedback among the plants and their microbiomes that enables plant coexistence.
C_LIO_LIOur results highlight the importance of plant-microbial interactions in microbial invasion success, as well as the susceptibility of plant coexistence to soil-associated microbial invaders during transient dynamics. Broadly, our approach integrating a host-microbiome framework with time-dependent interactions is promising for predicting biodiversity dynamics in a changing world.

"Soluble amyloid beta oligomers (A{beta}Os) are a hypothesized source of neurotoxicity in Alzheimers Disease. Binding proteins that recognize these species may have high utility in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. However, identifying binders that recognize A{beta}Os directly generated from the aggregation cascade is made challenging by the short lifetime and low concentrations of oligomer populations. We report a new strategy for detecting binding to A{beta}Os as they form during A{beta}42 aggregation using a genetically encoded biosensor. We show that our method enables rapid and highly reproducible measurement of the activity of existing A{beta}O binders and can be used to select for new binders with improved potency. We uncover hits that are >20 fold more effective than reported binders at delaying secondary nucleation, the step in A{beta} aggregation thought to generate the highest amounts of toxic oligomers. Our approach may greatly accelerate the discovery and characterization of binding proteins that target A{beta}Os."
"Evaluating others prosocial tendencies can benefit individuals by allowing them to interact with prosocial individuals and avoid antisocial ones. The ontogeny of humans strong prosocial preference has been widely investigated using the hill paradigm. Childrens preference for helper over hinderer agents was measured after they watched a scene in which the helper agent pushed a climber up a hill while the hinderer agent pushed the climber down the hill. Bonobos tested with the hill paradigm preferred the hinderer over the helper, contrasting previous findings for other nonhuman primates. We tested Tonkean macaques (Macaca tonkeana) using the same procedure as the one used with bonobos to see whether they would also exhibit a hinderer preference. Subjects did not prefer the helper over the hinderer (or vice versa). The low attentional level observed in our subjects suggests a lack of interest in the video stimuli. This finding relates to more general questions regarding how animals perceive abstract animated onscreen stimuli and the relevance of the hill paradigm in investigating prosocial preferences. Studies using various experimental paradigms with conspecifics or human actors as social agents are needed to investigate further the social evaluation of prosocial behaviours in Tonkean macaques, bonobos, and other primates."
"BackgroundThe rapid growth of biological data from omics and transcriptomics research necessitates tools that streamline data visualisation and interpretation.

The open-source nature of the tool, coupled with its user-friendly interface, facilitates customization and integration into existing workflows, making it a valuable resource for both individual researchers and collaborative teams."
"According to the tagging and capture hypothesis, long-lasting long-term potentiation (LTP) requires protein synthesis and a synaptic tag, which is a synapse specific memory of the synapse with a so far unclear molecular or biophysical identity. Here we use an interdisciplinary approach to explore the hypothesis that interaction between the dynamics of actin and the spine geometry can provide such a memory. Using a mathematical model, we demonstrate that this implementation of the tag requires an increase in the stable, cross-linked pool of actin filaments, and is not possible without this stable pool. Using FRAP experiments, we show that such an increase in stable actin can indeed be observed after cLTP in vitro. Thus, the interaction between actin dynamics and spine geometry could indeed serve as a synaptic tag for LTP."
"Humans start new friendships and social connections throughout their lives and such relationships foster mental and physical well-being. While friendship initiation may depend on alignment of subtle and complex personal variables, here we investigated whether it also depends on basic features of social environments. This would be analogous to other fundamental behaviours like foraging which depend on basic features of the environment such as the density of opportunities and the likelihood of success. In a pre-registered online study (n=783), we found people were more likely to send friend requests as the density of friendship opportunities decreased and frequency of success increased. Further, we found task-related measures, like overall friend requests, were correlated with personality-related factors like social thriving and anhedonia. Next, in an ultra-high-field fMRI study (n=24), we found that both fundamental features of social environments - opportunity density and frequency of success - affected neural activity across a network of regions linked to foraging including dorsal raphe nucleus, substantia nigra, and anterior insula. Finally, in resting-state fMRI data (n=400), we showed that model predicted estimates of anhedonia were related to functional connectivity between components of the same network. Thus, humans consider the background statistics of an environment while making social decisions and these decisions are linked to activity in ancient subcortical circuits mediating the influence of environmental statistics on other aspects of behaviour. Moreover, individual differences in how environmental features influence social behaviour are associated with variation in personality and psychiatric traits, offering new insights into inter-individual variability in social functioning."
"Flavonols are subclasses of flavonoids, with hundreds of structures identified in plants. This chemical diversity primarily arises from glycosylation, where sugars are selectively added to the flavonol backbone. While flavonol profiles vary across species and organs, the evolutionary forces shaping this chemodiversity and the physiological significance of specific glycosides remain a mystery. Here, we reveal that finely tuned transcriptional regulation and the sugar selectivity of glycosyltransferases drive the formation of distinct organ specific flavonol profiles and a specific flavonol is necessary for male fertility. In Solanaceae pollen, two flavonol glycosides, K2 (kaempferol 3-O-glucosyl(1 [-&gt;] 2)galactoside) and Q2 (quercetin 3-O-glucosyl(1 [-&gt;] 2)galactoside), are exclusively accumulated. K2 is evolutionarily conserved, while Q2 was lost over time. Consistently, K2 is essential for male fertility, whereas Q2 and aglycones fail to rescue fertility defects. These findings suggest that individual flavonol glycosides have distinct physiological roles, either actively maintained or discarded through evolutionary selection."
"Narrowband ultraviolet radiation (NB-UVR) therapy is widely utilized in dermatology worldwide. While the immunosuppressive effects of ultraviolet radiation are well-documented, its non-inflammatory effects remain poorly understood. This study evaluated the effects of sub-minimal erythema dose (MED) narrowband ultraviolet radiation using a canine model. The effects of narrowband-ultraviolet B (310 nm) and A2 wavelengths (320 and 330 nm) were compared. Initially, we demonstrated the therapeutic potential of NB-UVR in dogs with spontaneous atopic dermatitis (n = 6, p < 0.05). Following 300 mJ/cm{superscript 2} sub-MED ultraviolet radiation exposure, intradermal skin testing, skin mast cell counts, and RNA sequencing analysis were conducted. Additionally, cell viability (WST assay) and apoptosis (DAPI staining) were assessed in vitro using a canine mast cell line. Ultraviolet radiation exposure significantly reduced intradermal skin test scores across all wavelengths and decreased skin mast cell counts at 310 nm (n = 3, p < 0.05). In vitro, cell viability was significantly reduced at 310 and 320 nm (p < 0.05), and 310 nm irradiation specifically increased apoptotic cell numbers (p < 0.05). RNA sequencing identified 71 differentially expressed genes at 320 nm, with enrichment analysis highlighting muscle cell components and functions, potentially associated with arrector pili muscle activity. These findings suggest that 310 nm irradiation induces apoptosis, while 320 nm elicits non-inflammatory modulatory effects, highlighting distinct wavelength-specific therapeutic mechanisms of narrowband ultraviolet radiation."
"AbstractOur use of language, which is profoundly social in nature, essentially takes place in interactive contexts and is shaped by precise coordination dynamics that interlocutors must observe. Thus, language interaction is highly demanding on fast adjustment of speech production. Here, we developed a real-time coupled-oscillators virtual partner that allows - by changing the coupling strength parameters - to modulate the ability to synchronise speech with a virtual speaker. Then, we recorded the intracranial brain activity of 16 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy while they performed a verbal coordination task with the virtual partner (VP). More precisely, patients had to repeat short sentences synchronously with the VP. This synchronous speech task is efficient to highlight both the dorsal and ventral language pathways. Importantly, combining time-resolved verbal coordination and neural activity shows more spatially differentiated patterns and different types of neural sensitivity along the dorsal pathway. More precisely, high-frequency activity in left secondary auditory regions is highly sensitive to verbal coordinative dynamics, while primary regions are not. Finally, while bilateral engagement was observed in the high-frequency activity of the IFG BA44--which seems to index online coordinative adjustments that are continuously required to compensate deviation from synchronisation-- interpretation of right hemisphere involvement should be approached cautiously due to relatively sparse electrode coverage. These findings illustrate the possibility and value of using a fully dynamic, adaptive and interactive language task to gather deeper understanding of the subtending neural dynamics involved in speech perception, production as well as their interaction."
"Variable platinum responses drive high mortality in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), but to date, there is no molecular approach to define resistance levels for clinical decision-making. Here, we developed the organoid drug resistance assay (ODR-test) with patient-derived organoids from our ovarian cancer biobank and found that all HGSOC patients develop molecular resistance under exposure to carboplatin, although with varying clinical implications. Sustained phenotypic reprogramming and cellular plasticity under carboplatin pressure emerged as a conserved mechanism irrespective of the basal resistance level. Transcriptional and proteomic analyses revealed changes in cell adhesion and differentiation in post-platinum lines as adaptive responses that drive the increase in resistance. We identified Keratin 17 (KRT17) as a mediator of developing platinum resistance and validated its function by CRISPR/Cas9 and overexpression. Additionally, we found that KRT17 expression status (K-score) is a significant negative prognostic histopathological biomarker in a large cohort (N=384) of advanced HGSOC patients. In organoids, increased KRT17 levels enhanced sensitivity to PI3K/Akt inhibitors Alpelisib and Afuresertib, highlighting the potential of KRT17 as a stratification biomarker for targeted therapies."
"Mitonuclear discordance--evolutionary discrepancies between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA phylogenies--can arise from various factors, including introgression, incomplete lineage sorting, recent or ancient demographic fluctuations, sex-biased dispersal asymmetries, among others. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for accurately reconstructing evolutionary histories, as failing to account for discordance can lead to misinterpretations of species boundaries, phylogenetic relationships, and historical biogeographic patterns. In this study, we investigate the evolutionary drivers of mitonuclear discordance in the Tropidurus spinulosus species group, which contains nine species of lizards inhabiting open tropical and subtropical environments in South America. Using a combination of population genetic and phylogenomic approaches, applied to mitochondrial and nuclear data, we identified different instances of gene flow that occurred in ancestral lineages of extant species. Our results point to a complex evolutionary history marked by prolonged isolation between species, demographic fluctuations, and potential episodes of secondary contact with genetic admixture. These conditions likely facilitated mitochondrial genome capture while diluting signals of nuclear introgression. Furthermore, we found no strong evidence supporting incomplete lineage sorting or natural selection as primary drivers of the observed mitonuclear discordance. Therefore, the unveiled patterns are most consistent with neutral demographic processes, coupled with ancient mitochondrial introgression, as the main factors underlying the mismatch between nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies in this system. Future research could further explore the role of other demographic processes, such as asymmetric sex-biased dispersal, in shaping these complex evolutionary patterns."
"AlphaFold3 has revolutionized biology by enabling the prediction of protein complexes with various biomolecules, including small molecular ligands. However, the ligand structures predicted by the model often contain stereochemical errors. In this study, our comprehensive evaluation of AlphaFold3 and its clone model, Boltz-1, demonstrated significant limitations in ligand stereochemistry of their predicted structures, including chirality, bond, and angle geometries. To address the issue, we developed the restraint-guided inference method that applies stereochemical restraints during the reverse diffusion process. This approach perfectly reproduces the chirality specified in the input chemical structure and improves bond and angle geometries of ligands, while maintaining comparable performance in binding pose prediction. Our method provides a practical solution to the stereochemical errors in predicting protein-ligand complexes, thereby enhancing applications of structure prediction in structural biology and drug discovery. The materials supporting this article, including the source code and Colab notebook are available at github (https://github.com/cddlab/boltz_ext and https://github.com/cddlab/colabfold_boltz_restr)."
"Advances in metagenomics, deep learning, and generative protein design have enabled broad in silico exploration of sequence space, but experimental characterization is still constrained by the cost and scalability of DNA synthesis. Here, we present OMEGA (Oligo-based Multiplexed Efficient Gene Assembly), a low-cost, accessible method for assembling hundreds to thousands of full-length genes in parallel using standard laboratory techniques. OMEGA computationally fragments target genes into short, high-fidelity Golden Gate-compatible oligonucleotides that can be ordered as a pooled library and assembled across multiplexed subpools. We systematically optimized the number of fragments per gene and orthogonal ligation sites per reaction and determine that OMEGA can assemble up to 2.6 kb constructs using as many as 70 Golden Gate sites. To validate the approach, we assembled and functionally screened a library of 810 natural and synthetic GFP variants, recovering 94-97% of target sequences with high uniformity. OMEGA enables precision library construction at scale, with per-gene costs as low as $1.50, and offers a broadly applicable solution for bridging computational protein design with high-throughput experimental validation. We have developed OMEGA as an open-source software package and an easy-to-use Colab notebook available at https://github.com/RomeroLab/omega."
"Selective sweeps, resulting from the spread of beneficial, neutral, or deleterious mutations through a population, shape patterns of genetic variation at linked neutral sites. While many theoretical, computational, and statistical advances have been made in understanding the genomic signatures of selective sweeps in recombining populations, relatively less is understood in populations with little/no recombination, and arbitrary dominance and inbreeding. Using diffusion theory, we obtain the expected site frequency spectrum (SFS) at linked neutral sites immediately post and during the fixation of moderately or strongly beneficial mutations. We find that when a single hard sweep occurs, the SFS decays as 1/x for low derived allele frequencies (x), similar to the neutral SFS at equilibrium, whereas at higher derived allele frequencies, it follows a 1/x2 power law. These power laws are universal in the sense that they are independent of the dominance and inbreeding coefficients, and also characterize the SFS during the sweep. Additionally, we find that the derived allele frequency where the SFS shifts from the 1/x to 1/x2 power law is inversely proportional to the selection strength: thus under strong selection, the SFS follows the 1/x2 dependence for most allele frequencies, resembling a rapidly expanding neutral population. When clonal interference is pervasive, the SFS immediately post-fixation becomes U-shaped and can be approximated by the equilibrium SFS of selected sites. Our results will be important in developing statistical methods to infer the timing and strength of recent selective sweeps in asexual populations, genomic regions that lack recombination, and clonally propagating tumor populations."
"The development of pollen is critical or seed plants, and depends on precise cellular and molecular mechanisms. It is known that the cell wall plays a key role in the progression of pollen maturation. An earlier phase in pollen development is the meiosis of pollen mother cells (PMCs), the fundamental process for producing viable pollen grains. However, the significance of the cell wall during pre-meiosis processes has remained unclear. Pectin, a major component of the cell wall, is known to accumulate abundantly in pollen. To investigate the significance of the cell wall during pollen meiosis, we generated an arad1 gals2 gals3 triple mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, lacking the genes responsible for normal synthesis of arabinan and galactan, which constitute the side chains of pectin. Although vegetative growth and cell wall properties were comparable in wild-type (WT) and arad1 gals2 gals3, the pollen development in the mutant failed during meiosis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that pectic arabinan and galactan accumulated in WT PMCs before meiosis, but this was not observed in mutant PMCs. We believe that this study is the first to demonstrate the critical role of cell wall components, specifically pectic arabinan and galactan, in the pre-meiosis processes of pollen development.

HighlightPectic arabinan and galactan accumulate on the surface of pollen mother cells and this accumulation is essential for pollen meiosis."
"Pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death, is associated with large cell swelling and plasma membrane rupture. Recently, such swelling has been shown to occur in a two steps fashion, but the precise molecular and biophysic mechanisms driving the process remain elusive. We demonstrate through advanced quantitative microscopy that, between the two swelling phases, cell volume stabilizes, while plasma membrane permeability to ions and small molecules is markedly elevated due to the formation of pores. From a biophysical perspective, how such a volume plateau exists is puzzling as ion pumps should not regulate the cell volume in these conditions. To address this, we developed a physical model based on an ions pump-and-leak framework, incorporating the dynamics of non-selective pore formation. We experimentally identify two distinct pore permeability dynamics, associated to an increase in the water filtration coefficient and to an ion selectivity decrease due to pore opening. Altogether our results suggest the existence of two mechanistically different pore types, likely driven by separate molecular players. Our findings provide fundamental insights into the biophysics of cell death and may have broader implications for understanding membrane rupture in other pathological contexts.

Significance StatementAmong various programmed lytic cell death, pyropytosis is marked by dramatic changes in cell shape and large fluctuations in volume, fundamentally altering the cells physical properties. These biophysical changes are not mere byproducts but integral components of the death process, closely interacting with molecular events. By combining optogenetics, quantitative microscopy, and modeling, we show that a progressive increase in plasma membrane permeability alone drives cell swelling and membrane lysis. We therefore demonstrate that a deeper understanding of these dynamic cell modifications and their consequences will shed light on the molecular and biophysical mechanisms driving different forms of cell death."
"The rapid growth of genomic data expands species diversity but also causes taxonomic imbalance, with certain species heavily overrepresented. Both data volume and imbalance challenge the accuracy and efficiency of metagenomic tools. Here, we present Chimera, a transformative tool harnessing the Interleaved Merged Cuckoo Filter (IMCF) and FairMin-Cap (FMC) strategy for next-level performance. It achieves the highest classification accuracy while providing an astonishing 162-fold faster database assembly than Kraken2, constructing the complete RefSeq genome database within mere minutes using under 32 GB of RAM, enabling rapid and cost-effective database updates. Furthermore, Chimeras universal memory scalability supports at least 300,000 species and potentially over 800,000 species in practical 1 TB systems, overwhelming traditional software solutions. Our results establish Chimera as a foundational tool for the next era of metagenomic research, laying a crucial cornerstone for the future of ultramassive genome datasets."
"The proper function of the lower urinary tract depends on its ability to sense and react to mechanical forces as urine is produced, transported, stored, and eliminated; however, our current understanding of the mechanosensors involved in these events is limited. TMEM63 ion channels are reported to function as mechanosensors/osmosensors in other organs, and our studies revealed that the primary site of Tmem63a and Tmem63b gene expression and TMEM63B protein expression in the mouse bladder wall was the urothelium. Despite this localization, voiding behavior in conditional urothelial Tmem63b knockout mice, assessed using a video-monitored void-spot screening assay, was not significantly different from control mice, even when the urothelium was stressed by exposure to cyclophosphamide. We further observed that dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons, including those innervating the bladder, were also sites of Tmem63a, Tmem63b, and TMEM63B expression. Again, voiding behavior was not impacted in conditional sensory neuron Tmem63b knockout mice, treated or not with cyclophosphamide. Our studies reveal that the urothelium and dorsal root ganglia are sites of Tmem63a, Tmem63b, and TMEM63B expression, but deletion of Tmem63b alone in these tissues does not result in a demonstrable voiding phenotype."
"BackgroundCell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) facilitate the delivery of a variety of therapeutic molecules across the plasma membrane, from small chemical substances to nucleic acid-based macromolecules, such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Among neutral ASOs, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) have been extensively studied as potential medical treatments for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a severe genetic disease that causes muscle degeneration progressively. Over the last few decades, many in silico methods have emerged to detect novel CPPs, counterbalancing the cost of wet-lab experiments.

ResultsIn this study, we propose CPP2Vec, a Word2Vec-based CPP prediction method, where the Word2Vec technique is used to represent amino acid sequences of peptides. We developed three task-specific supervised machine learning models for CPP-Classification, Uptake-Efficiency and PMO-Delivery. The first two models were designed to determine if an unseen peptide is a CPP and to pre-dict its uptake efficiency, respectively, while the PMO-Delivery model predicts if a peptide could enhance the cellular delivery of a PMO-complex compared to its naked version. Furthermore, we explored an alternative approach using pre-trained protein-based Large Language Models (LLMs) - T5, BERT, and ESM-2 - to generate the embeddings, resulting in three task-specific models, namely CPP2LLM. A comparison of CPP2Vec and CPP2LLM with state-of-the-art CPP prediction tools is included, proving their significant predictive performance.

ConclusionIn this research, we present a Machine Learning (ML)-based tool that introduces the use of the Word2Vec technique in the field of CPPs pre-diction. Notably, it stands out for not requiring any manual a priori feature engineering and for its ability to generalize without any changes between studied tasks. CPP2Vec is available for use at: https://github.com/SSvolou/CPP2Vec."
"The activity of neurotransmitter-based cell types in the cuneiform and pedunculopontine nuclei during locomotion, non-locomotor behaviors, and following sensory stimulation is not fully understood. Using fiber photometry in mice, we found cell-type specific responses to sensory stimuli. Glutamatergic and GABAergic cells responded to sound, visual looming, and air puffs, except for pedunculopontine GABAergic cells, which did not respond to visual looming. Cholinergic cells responded to air puffs. When a stimulus triggered high-speed locomotion, activity increased in cuneiform glutamatergic neurons. Conversely, when low-speed locomotion was triggered, activity increased in pedunculopontine glutamatergic neurons. During spontaneous low-speed locomotion, activity increased in pedunculopontine glutamatergic cells. Activity also increased in a cell type-specific manner during grooming or rearing. Our study shows cell type-specific activity in the cuneiform or pedunculopontine nuclei during locomotion, non-locomotor behaviors, and following sensory stimulation. Sensory responsiveness likely has relevance in Parkinsons disease, where sensory circuits are increasingly targeted to improve walking."
"High-dimensional omics data often contain more variables than observations, which negatively impacts the performance of classical data analysis methods. Dimensionality reduction is typically addressed through variable selection strategies that incorporate a penalty term into the model. While effective for selecting task-specific variables, this approach may not be optimal when the goal is to preserve the dataset structure and the overall biological information for multiple downstream analyses. In such cases, a priori unsupervised variable selection is preferable. In this study, we evaluate several unsupervised variable selection approaches to derive a representative subset of the original dataset. Building on the performance assessment results, we introduce TRIM-IT, a novel tool for unsupervised variable selection, clustering, survival analysis, and differential gene expression analysis. Applied to glioblastoma (GBM) data, TRIM-IT identified three clusters that correlate with tumor histology, exhibit distinct survival curves, and display unique molecular profiles with genes potentially serving as biomarkers. The tool is available for reproduction and adaptation to other studies."
"Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) significantly diminishes the quality of life of cancer survivors; however, objective diagnostic markers and the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to identify noninvasive EEG-based biomarkers of CRF by examining cortical activity and functional connectivity.

We recorded resting-state and task-related [repetitive submaximal elbow flexions (EFs) until self-perceived exhaustion] high-density electroencephalography (EEG) from 10 cancer survivors with CRF and 14 healthy controls (HC). In our analysis, task-induced fatigue was categorized as mild, moderate, and severe, corresponding to the level of fatigue perceived at the beginning, middle, and end of the task period.

Our study revealed the following significant findings: (1) Linear mixed-effects modeling of event-related desynchronization (ERD) EEG analysis during the EF task demonstrated significant effects of group and fatigue levels in the alpha band (8-12 Hz). (2) EF task-specific functional connectivity was estimated using the debiased weighted phase-lag index (dwPLI), which demonstrated reduced inter-regional connectivity in the M1 and prefrontal regions in the CRF group compared with the HC group. (3) The dwPLI analysis identified significantly reduced alpha-band connectivity strength in the CRF group, particularly between the right supramarginal gyrus and other brain regions during mild fatigue. (4) Additionally, resting-state EEG exhibited globally elevated deltaband (1-4 Hz) activity in CRF survivors than HC, potentially reflecting chronic fatigue. These observations emphasize the clinical relevance of resting-state EEG, motor activity-related ERD and functional brain connectivity as potential CRF biomarkers. Future research should validate these findings in larger cohorts and provide insights into more objective CRF diagnosis and the development of personalized interventions for alleviating CRF."
"The interdependent orchestration of proteins, coding DNA sequences (CDS), and adjacent regulatory DNA elements underpins biological functionality, where evolutionary constraints shape codon usage, transcriptional regulation, and structural stability. We present ProDMM, a multimodal framework that deciphers these systemic relationships through unified sequence modeling. Integrating a context-aware encoder with conditional generation, our architecture captures codependent patterns between protein motifs and cis-regulatory syntax. ProDMMs encoder demonstrates superior predictive capabilities in forecasting pathway-level phenotypes and protein expression profiles, outperforming conventional single-modality approaches. Its decoder generates synthetically optimized regulatory elements by resolving spatial dependencies between coding sequences and adjacent non-coding regions, enabling transcriptional fine-tuning unavailable to sequence-agnostic methods. By resolving how localized CDS-NCDS-protein interdependencies propagate to system-level phenotypes, ProDMM establishes a paradigm for holistic biological sequence engineering. This approach enables coordinated optimization of translation efficiency, enzymatic activity, and pathway flux, offering transformative potential for designing tailored biosynthesis systems and advancing sustainable bioproduction strategies."
"Arca noae, also known as the Noahs Ark clam, is a bivalve mollusk found in the shallow coastal waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic Ocean. This species plays a crucial ecological role by filtering plankton and organic particles from the water, helping maintain water quality and supporting nutrient cycling in marine ecosystems. It is also an important food source for various marine predators, including fish and crustaceans, thereby contributing to the coastal food web. Arca noae is notably resilient to environmental stressors, such as temperature fluctuations, changes in salinity, and pollution, making it a valuable model species for studying how bivalves adapt and respond to stress. While it is not commonly harvested commercially, Arca noae is of great interest to marine researchers due to its ability to thrive in diverse coastal habitats. The reference genome of Arca noae will thus provide important evolutionary insights. The entirety of the genome sequence was assembled into 19 contiguous chromosomal pseudomolecules. This chromosome-level assembly encompasses 1.5 Gb, composed of 257 contigs and 119 scaffolds, with contig and scaffold N50 values of 20.5 Mb and 84.7 Mb, respectively."
"The perirhinal cortex (PER) is crucial for object recognition memory and is divided into areas 35 and 36, which have distinct cytoarchitectural and connections. The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), subdivided into dorsolateral (DLE) and ventral intermediate (VIE) regions, processes visual and spatial information, projecting it to the hippocampus. However, molecular studies that separately analyze these regions and their cellular populations are lacking, which hinders the identification of marker genes and the understanding of their molecular profiles. In this context, our study investigated the molecular profile of the aforementioned regions using male C57BL/6 mice whose samples were subjected to laser microdissection (LCM). Areas 35 and 36 of the PER and the DLE and VIE subregions of the LEC were isolated and submitted to RNA-seq analysis. Sequencing read alignment was performed using the STAR package, and statistical analysis was carried out with the DESeq2 package to estimate gene expression in the regions of interest. The results were divided into two parts. First, areas 35 and 36 of the PER were analyzed separately, revealing 1 differentially expressed gene between A35 and A36, 167 between A35 and DLE, 708 between A36 and DLE, 693 between VIE and DLE, 1,154 between A35 and VIE, and 1,591 between A36 and VIE. In the second part, areas 35 and 36 were considered as a single PER region, identifying 657 differentially expressed genes between PER and DLE and 1,878 between PER and VIE. Greater segregation of the transcriptomic profile was found between physically distant regions (areas 35 and 36 vs. VIE, DLE vs. VIE) compared to physically closer regions (A35 vs. A36; areas 35 and 36 vs. DLE). Additionally, our transcriptomic analysis identified potential marker genes for PER (6 genes more highly expressed in PER compared to LEC subregions), DLE (4 genes more highly expressed in DLE compared to PER and VIE), and VIE (8 genes more highly expressed in VIE compared to PER). In silico analysis showed shared enrichment of neuroactive ligand receptor interaction pathway in all comparisons, considering PER areas both separately and together. In the comparison between areas 35 and 36 with LEC, there was higher expression of genes encoding receptors of melanocortin, leptin, and glucagon, suggesting that PER, compared to LEC, would be more sensitive to these hormones and participate of nutritional status of the organism. There was also higher expression of genes associated with axonal guidance of glutamatergic neurons in DLE compared to VIE, which may be linked to an increased neuroplasticity mechanisms pro-excitability in the dorsal LEC region. Supporting this hypothesis, higher expression of the genes BDNF, GDFN 1 receptor were observed in DLE compared to VIE. Thus, our study is the first to show the molecular differences in areas 35 and 36 of the PER and the DLE and VIE subregions of the LEC. These findings may contribute to the understanding of these regions and the identification of specific molecular markers for cellular populations, helping to infer possible functional roles of these populations based on the molecular profile identified."
"BackgroundMetabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) can progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet the immune mechanisms driving this transition remain unclear.

MethodsIn a chronic Western diet (WD) mouse model, we performed single-nuclei RNA sequencing to track MAFLD progression into HCC and subsequent tumor inhibition upon dietary correction.

ResultsCarcinogenesis begins during MAFLD, with tumor cells entering dormancy when HCC is mitigated. Rather than purely tolerogenic, the liver actively engages immune responses targeting myofibroblasts, fibroblasts and hepatocytes to maintain tissue homeostasis. Cytotoxic cells contribute to turnover of liver cells but do not primarily target the tumor. NKT cells predominate under chronic WD, while monocytes join them in HCC progression on a WD. Upon dietary correction, monocyte-driven immunity confers protection against HCC through targeting tissue homeostatic pathways and antioxidant mechanisms. Crucially, liver tissue response--not merely immune activation--dictates whether tumors grow or regress, emphasizing the importance of restoring liver tissue integrity. Also, protection against HCC is linked to a distinct immunological pattern, differing from healthy controls, underscoring the need for immune reprogramming.

ConclusionThese findings reveal the dual roles of similar pathways, where immune patterns targeting different cells shape distinct outcomes. Restoring tissue homeostasis and regeneration creates a tumor-hostile microenvironment, whereas tumor-directed approaches fail to remodel the TME. This underscores the need for tissue remodeling strategies in cancer prevention and treatment.

Lay summaryOur study challenges the traditional view that the liver is purely tolerant to immune responses, revealing that it actively regulates immunity to maintain tissue health. We found that liver cancer (HCC) begins during fatty liver disease (MAFLD) but can be halted if immune cells--especially monocytes--restore tissue integrity. Instead of focusing solely on killing tumors, effective immunotherapy should harness the bodys natural ability to repair the liver, creating an environment where cancer cannot thrive. This discovery paves the way for innovative treatments that promote immune-driven tissue regeneration as a strategy for cancer prevention and therapy."
"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution exploration of cellular diversity and gene regulation, yet analyzing such data remains challenging due to technical and methodological limitations. Existing task-specific deep generative models like Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and its variants struggle to incorporate external biological knowledge, while transformer-based foundational large Language Models (LLMs or large LaMs) face limitations in computational cost and applicability to tabular gene expression data. Here, we introduce sciL-aMA (single-cell interpretable Language Model Adapter), a novel representation learning frame-work that bridges these gaps by integrating static gene embeddings from multimodal LLMs with scRNA-seq tabular data through a paired-VAE architecture. Our approach generates context-aware representations for both cells and genes and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key single-cell downstream tasks, including batch effect correction, cell clustering, and cell-state-specific gene marker and module identification, while maintaining computational efficiency. sciL-aMA offers a computationally efficient, unified framework for comprehensive single-cell data analysis and biologically interpretable gene module discovery.

"This comprehensive benchmarking study explores the performance of three prominent machine learning libraries: PyTorch, Keras with TensorFlow backend, and Scikit-learn with the same criteria, software, and hardware. The evaluation encompasses two diverse datasets, ""student performance"" and ""College Attending Plan Classification,"" supported by Kaggle platforms utilizing feedforward neural networks (FNNs) as the modeling technique. The findings reveal that PyTorch and Keras with TensorFlow backend excel on the ""College Attending Plan Classification"" dataset, with PyTorch achieving impeccable precision, Recall, and F1-score for both classes. While Scikit-learn demonstrates commendable performance, it trails behind these libraries in this context. On the ""Student Performance"" dataset, all three libraries deliver comparable results, with Scikit-learn exhibiting the lowest accuracy at 16%. Keras with TensorFlow backend and PyTorch attain accuracy rates of 23%, respectively. Moreover, this study offers valuable insights into each librarys unique strengths and weaknesses when confronted with diverse dataset types. PyTorch emerges as the go-to choice for demanding tasks requiring high performance, while Scikit-learn proves advantageous for simpler tasks with modest computational demands. Keras with TensorFlow backend strikes a balance between performance and user-friendliness. This benchmarking endeavor equips machine learning practitioners with valuable guidance for selecting the most suitable library or framework tailored to their project requirements. It underscores the pivotal role of library choice in achieving optimal results in machine learning endeavors."
"The long shelf-life and stability of DNA makes this platform highly attractive for low-cost, rapid delivery of pandemic response vaccines. Protocols utilized for clinical grade plasmid manufacture by contract development and manufacturing organizations are not readily accessible to academic and public research laboratories engaged in early-phase plasmid vaccine development. We present here the framework for DNA manufacturing using 3L-scale fermentation, anion-exchange chromatography and tangential flow filtration (TFF) leading to RNAase-free manufacture of plasmid DNA. The Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus vaccine plasmid pWRG/VEEV, encoding the glycoprotein (E)3, E2, 6K and E1 genes was used as the prototype for this process development. The current effort yielded >95% pure and >80% supercoiled pWRG/VEEV plasmid preparations at 50-g wet cell weight scale. These data showed feasibility of manufacturing, highly pure pWRG/VEEV plasmid DNA using a cGMP compliant manufacturing process.

"Plants can ""cry for help"" to recruit supportive microbiome members during stressful conditions. We evaluated the activation dynamics of root zone soil bacteria in response to phytohormones produced when plants are stressed, hypothesizing that the activated taxa support plant resilience. We conducted a 2-week laboratory experiment using mesocosms of root zone soil collected from two different crops: the annual legume common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and the perennial grass switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). We inactivated the microbiome by drying and then treated the soils with either abscisic acid, salicylic acid, a carrier control (methanol), or water, and then quantified the reactivation dynamics of bacterial populations over time, at one, 7, and 14 days after phytohormone addition, using amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA and rDNA. There were several Actinobacterial taxa that switched from an average population-inactive to a population-active state after exposure to abscisic acid and salicylic acid, with Microbispora lineages switching especially noted. Some taxa were activated only in one crops soil, and some were activated in both crops soils in response to the same phytohormone. This work suggests that different bacteria have different specificities to phytohormones as plant stress signals and provides insights into understanding the mechanisms by which stressed plants may ""cry for help"" to recruit bacteria from the root zone to the rhizosphere.

ImportanceGlobal food security is an urgent societal challenge that has been intensified by climate change and other anthropogenic stressors placed on the environment. Microbial bioinoculants are a promising solution to improve crop health and resilience, but ensuring their persistence and activation in the field remains a challenge. This study examined how dormant root-zone associated bacteria reactivate after exposure to the plant stress hormones abscisic acid and salicylic acid. The experiment revealed that certain bacteria taxa could reactivate in response to these plant stress signals and persist for at least two weeks. This work advances understanding of the potential cues for reactivation of beneficial plant-associated microbes and supports goals toward developing microbial solutions for sustainable agriculture."
"Pregnancy- and birth-related factors affect offspring brain development, emphasizing the importance of early life exposures. While most previous studies have focused on a few variables in isolation, here we investigated associations between a broad range of pregnancy- and birth-related variables and multivariate cortical brain MRI features. Our sample consisted of 8,396 children aged 8.9 to 11.1 years from the ABCD Study. Through multiple correspondence analysis and factor analysis of mixed data, we distilled numerous pregnancy and birth variables into four overarching dimensions; maternal pregnancy complications, maternal substance use, low birth weight and prematurity, and newborn birth complications. Vertex-wise measures of cortical thickness, surface area, and curvature were fused using linked independent component analysis. Linear mixed effects models showed that maternal pregnancy complications and low birth weight and prematurity were associated with smaller global surface area. Additionally, low birth weight and prematurity was associated with complex regional cortical patterns reflecting bidirectional variations in both surface area and cortical thickness. Newborn birth complications showed multivariate patterns reflecting smaller occipital- and larger temporal area, bi-directional frontal area variations, and reduced cortical thickness across the cortex. Maternal substance use showed no associations with child cortical structure. By employing a multifactorial and multivariate morphometric fusion approach, we connected complications during pregnancy and fetal size and prematurity to global surface area and specific regional signatures across child cortical MRI features.

Significance StatementEarly life stages, including pregnancy and birth circumstances, are critically important for a wide range of real-life outcomes for the child. In this study, we linked maternal complications during pregnancy and low birth weight and prematurity to globally reduced cortical surface area, and low birth weight and prematurity, in addition to pregnancy and birth complications, to complex cortical structural patterns later in late childhood. Our findings underscore the importance of providing support to mothers and children during these crucial phases, helping to ensure optimal conditions for healthy child development."
"Long COVID, or post-acute sequela of COVID (PASC), has emerged as a major post-pandemic challenge, with lasting neurological effects in a substantial number of patients. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of PASC remains elusive, largely due to the lack of suitable animal models that replicate key clinical and pathological features, especially in survivors of acute infection. Here, we employed the Omicron BA.1-infected AC70 hACE2 Tg mice to explore the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our findings in the AC70/BA.1 model demonstrated that surviving mice developed lasting neurological sequelae of COVID-19, making it a promising platform for studying the pathogenesis of neuro- or long-COVID. Histopathological examinations revealed a transient pulmonary inflammatory response that correlated with the levels of live virus, whereas neuroinflammation within the brains persisted and progressed beyond the acute phase, without a clear linkage to direct virus effects. We showed that the severity of neurological sequelae directly correlated with the degree of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption, alterations in tight junctions (TJs) and fibrinogen extravasation into the brain parenchyma. Additionally, BA.1-infected mice elicited a sustained systemic prothrombotic state, with dysregulated coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways in an organ-specific manner, as evidenced by distinct pattern of intracellular fibrin(ogen) depositions, elevated d-dimers, and tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) expression in the lungs and brains. We also found a positive correlation between progressive neuroinflammation and t-PA expression, which was closely co-localized with Iba-1-positive cells, indicating that activated microglia may serve as an additional source of t-PA in the CNS. Lastly, we showed that BA.1 variant triggered prolonged anti-Annexin A2 (ANXA2) autoantibody production. ANXA2 is essential for the neurovascular system, coordinating multiply dynamic processes within the endothelium, including cell surface fibrinolysis and TJ assembly. Our analysis revealed that impaired TJ structures coexisted with diminished ANXA2 levels around the brain vessels, suggesting its involvement in BBB dysfunction and neuroinflammation.

Author SummaryLong COVID symptoms, especially neurological complications, remains a key public health concern worldwide. Alterations in the cerebrovascular system, along with ongoing coagulation disorders, may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of this condition. Here, we established murine model for study post-acute sequela of COVID (PASC). We demonstrated that AC70 Tg mice infected with a high dose of BA.1 Omicron variant developed prolonged neurological symptoms, accompanied by progressive neuroinflammation in survivors. Our findings clearly showed the involvement of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disfunction in the severity of neuropathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also showed that the bidirectional interaction between dysregulated coagulation/ fibrinolysis and inflammatory systems may exhibit a distinct pattern in the CNC, significantly contributing to persistent neurological symptoms. Finally, we highlighted a potential role of malfunctioning Annexin A2 (ANXA2) in this phenomenon that may serve as a promising drug target for neuro-COVID interventions."
"BackgroundLumpy Skin Disease (LSD) lacks targeted treatment options and is managed using antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. This study evaluated the efficacy of a polyherbal combination therapy in the management of LSD in affected bovines.

Materials and Methods52 dairy cattle clinically diagnosed with LSD were enrolled in a field trial conducted under veterinary supervision. All animals received LUMPY-NIL Herbal Powder orally at 30 g twice daily, along with topical application of LUMPY-NIL Dermal Spray on closed nodules and LUMPY-NIL Ointment on open wounds. Daily monitoring included clinical signs, lesion progression, systemic symptoms, and milk yield recovery.

ResultsTreatment duration varied from 7 to 21 days depending on severity of the disease. New lesion formation ceased within 2-4 days of treatment initiation. Systemic symptoms such as fever, lethargy, and inappetence resolved within 1-3 days. Open wounds showed progressive healing with no signs of infection, and nodules dried and sloughed off by day 15 in most animals. Milk yield showed partial recovery (20%) by day 7 and returned to baseline by day 15. The reduction in nodule size and number ranged from 81% to 94% by days 10-15. No adverse effects were observed during the treatment period.

ConclusionThe polyherbal treatment combining demonstrated promising therapeutic benefits in managing clinical symptoms and accelerating recovery in LSD-infected cattle."
"During cancer development, mutations promote gene expression changes that cause transformation. Leukemia is frequently associated with aberrant HOXA expression driven by translocations in nucleoporin genes or KMT2A, and mutations in NPM1. How disparate mutations converge on this regulatory pathway is not understood. Here we demonstrate that mutant NPM1 (NPM1c) forms nuclear condensates in multiple human cell lines, mouse models, and primary patient samples. We show NPM1c phase separation is necessary and sufficient to coordinate the recruitment of NUP98 and KMT2A to condensates. Through extensive mutagenesis and pharmacological destabilization of phase separation, we find that NPM1c condensates are necessary for regulating gene expression, promoting in vivo expansion, and maintaining the undifferentiated leukemic state. Finally, we show that nucleoporin and KMT2A fusion proteins form condensates that are biophysically indistinguishable from NPM1c condensates. Together, these data define a new condensate underlying leukemias that we term coordinating bodies (C-bodies), and propose C-bodies as a therapeutic vulnerability."
"BackgroundAs technologies for genome-wide gene-expression analysis continue to develop, the databases storing the resulting data have grown accordingly. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) has grown to over 250,000 data series across more than 25,000 omics platforms. Likewise, ArrayExpress is comprised of over 70,000 transcriptome and methylome datasets. Conducting meta-analyses of data from these databases can be challenging, typically requiring extensive manual grouping of samples to identify experimental groups for comparison.

ResultsHere we present sampleclusteR, a lightweight R package which automates the clustering of gene-expression study samples based on their metadata. To demonstrate the utility of the approach to large scale analysis of GEO data series, 275 GEO data series were analysed using the package. sampleclusteR was able to correctly cluster 4694 of the 5081 samples across the 275 data sets in an unsupervised manner. In addition, 250 datasets from ArrayExpress were analysed by the package with 8547 of the 9154 samples being automatically clustered into correct groups. We show how sampleclusteR can be used to automate analysis of gene-expression datasets by conducting a meta-analysis of multiple GEO data series related to the Wnt signaling pathway. sampleclusteR correctly assigned all samples to the correct experimental groups and identified sets of differentially expressed genes for downstream analysis.

ConclusionssampleclusteR enables large-scale analysis of data from GEO or ArrayExpress by automating the clustering of both GEO and ArrayExpress metadata tables using text mining of their associated metadata."
"ObjectivesVitamin B12 plays a vital role in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (FOCM), a series of one-carbon transfer reactions that generate nucleotides (thymidylate (dTMP) and purines) and methionine. Inadequate levels of B12 impair FOCM, depressing de novo thymidylate (dTMP) synthesis, which in turn leads to uracil accumulation in DNA. This phenomenon has been well documented in nuclear DNA. Our previous work in liver tissue has shown that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is more sensitive to FOCM impairments in that mtDNA exhibits elevated uracil levels before uracil concentrations in nuclear DNA change. However, the functional consequences of uracil accumulation in mtDNA are largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine how a functional B12 deficiency (induced by reduced levels of the B12-dependent enzyme methionine synthase (MTR)) and dietary B12 deficiency affects mtDNA integrity and mitochondrial function in energetic and mitochondria-rich tissues such as skeletal muscle.

MethodsMale Mtr+/+ and Mtr+/- mice were weaned to either an AIN93G-based control (C) diet containing 25 {micro}g/kg vitamin B12 or a B12-deficient (-B12) diet containing 0 {micro}g/kg vitamin B12 to explore the effects of functional (Mtr+/-) and dietary B12 deficiency on muscle weight, uracil content in mtDNA, mtDNA content, and oxidative phosphorylation complex capacity in skeletal muscle. Aged (20-22mo) male C57BL6/N mice were acclimated to an AIN93G control diet four weeks, then received either weekly injections of saline (vehicle control [30 uL 0.9% NaCl]) or B12 (0.65mg per 30uL 0.9% NaCl) in each of two hindleg muscles [1.25 mg B12 total]) for 8 weeks.

ResultsThe tibialis anterior (TA) muscle from Mtr+/-mice exhibited lowered maximal respiratory capacity of complex I, II, and IV of the electron transport chain than did TA from Mtr+/+ mice. Exposure to the -B12 diet lowered maximal capacity of complex I in red, mitochondrially rich muscle (soleus and mitochondria-rich portions of quadriceps and gastrocnemius) (p=0.02). Levels of uracil accumulation in mtDNA in red muscle and gastrocnemius were elevated [~]10 fold with exposure to -B12 diet (p=0.04 and p<0.001, respectively). In aged mice gastrocnemius complex IV activity increased with intramuscular B12 supplementation (p=0.04).

ConclusionsExposure to a B12-deficient diet led to uracil accumulation in mtDNA and impaired maximal oxidative capacity in two different types of skeletal muscle. B12 supplementation improved complex IV maximal capacity in gastrocnemius from aged mice."
"Helicases are enzymes that use the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to translocate along and unwind nucleic acids. Accordingly, helicases are instrumental in maintaining genomic integrity and ensuring genetic diversity. Srs2 is a multi-functional DNA helicase that dismantles Rad51 nucleofilaments and regulates DNA strand invasion to prevent excessive or inappropriate homologous recombination in yeast. Consistently, the deletion of Srs2 has significant consequences for the maintenance of genome integrity in mitotic cells. In contrast, its role in meiotic recombination remains less clear. We present here substantial evidence that SRS2 plays an important role in meiotic recombination in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis srs2 mutants exhibit moderate defects in DNA damage-induced RAD51 focus formation, but SRS2 is dispensable for DNA repair and RAD51-dependent recombination in somatic cells. Meiotic progression and fertility appear unaffected in srs2 plants but strikingly, the absence of SRS2 leads to increased genetic interference accompanied by increased numbers of Class I COs and a reduction in MUS81-dependent Class II COs. SRS2 thus has both anti- and pro-CO roles during meiosis in Arabidopsis thaliana - acting as an anti-CO factor by influencing the stability and/or the dissociation of early recombination intermediates, while playing a pro-CO role by promoting MUS81-mediated resolution of meiotic recombination intermediates.

Author SummaryHelicases are enzymes that use ATP to unwind DNA. They play a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability. One such helicase, Srs2, is known to regulate homologous recombination in yeast by preventing excessive or inappropriate recombination events. While its function in mitotic cell division is well understood, its role in meiosis - the process that generates reproductive cells - remains less clear. We show here that SRS2 plays a significant role in meiotic recombination in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Although Arabidopsis plants lacking SRS2 do not exhibit major defects in DNA repair or fertility, they show modifications in meiotic crossover recombination patterns. Specifically, the absence of SRS2 shifts the balance between Class I and Class II crossovers, leading to an increase in Class I crossovers and a decrease in MUS81-dependent Class II crossovers. These findings provide new insights into the role of SRS2 in meiosis, suggesting that it has a dual role in the regulation of crossover formation."
"We employ fine-scale population genetic analyses to reveal dynamics among interacting forces that act at synonymous sites and introns among closely related Drosophila species. Synonymous codon usage bias has proven to be well-suited for population genetic inference. Under major codon preference, translationally superior ""major"" codons confer fitness benefits relative to their less efficiently and/or accurately decoded synonymous counterparts. Our codon family and lineage-specific analyses expand on previous findings in the Drosophila simulans lineage; patterns in naturally occurring polymorphism demonstrate fixation biases toward GC-ending codons that are consistent in direction, but heterogeneous in magnitude, among synonymous families. These forces are generally stronger than fixation biases in intron sequences. In contrast, population genetic analyses reveal unexpected evidence of codon preference reversals in the Drosophila melanogaster lineage. Codon family-specific polymorphism patterns support reduced efficacy of natural selection in most synonymous families but indicate reversals of favored states in the four codon families encoded by NAY. Accelerated synonymous fixations in favor of NAT and greater differences for both allele frequencies and fixation rates among X-linked, relative to autosomal, loci bolster support for fitness effect reversals. The specificity of preference reversals to codons whose cognate tRNAs undergo wobble position queuosine modification is intriguing. However, our analyses reveal prevalent dinucleotide preferences for ApT over ApC that act in opposition to GC favoring forces in both coding and intron regions. We present evidence that changes in the relative efficacy of translational selection and dinucleotide preference underlie apparent codon preference reversals."
"Coumarin is produced by various land plants, such as cherry trees, and is known to exhibit a wide range of physiological activities. Notably, one of its primary functions is the inhibition of seed germination. However, the structural basis underlying coumarins germination-inhibitory effect remains poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the structure-activity relationships of coumarin analogs in two plant species, white clover and Arabidopsis, and demonstrated that the benzene ring and ester bond within the coumarin skeleton constitute the minimal structural requirements for germination inhibition. The inhibitory effects of dihydrocoumarin, which lacks the double bond in the coumarin skeleton, varied among plant species, while those of various other modified coumarin analogs also differed across species. In both plant species, coumarin consistently proved to be one of the most potent inhibitors. Furthermore, the observation that dihydrocoumarin exhibited a strong germination inhibitory effect only in white clover suggests that certain coumarin analogs may act in a species-specific manner. Additionally, the mechanism of coumarin-mediated germination inhibition remains largely unclear. Using RNA-Seq analysis on Arabidopsis seeds, we uncovered a novel and critically important mechanism whereby coumarin suppresses the expression of genes encoding expansins, proteins that are responsible for loosening plant cell walls. This study is significant for understanding how coumarin contributes to plant competition in nature."
"The subcellular positioning of organelles is critical to their function and is dynamically adapted to changes in cell morphology. Yet, how cells sense shifts in their dimensions and redistribute organelles accordingly remains unclear. Here we reveal that cell-size-scaling of mitochondria distribution and function is directed by polarised trafficking of mRNAs. We identify a 29bp 3UTR motif in mRNA encoding TRAK2, a key determinant of mitochondria retrograde transport, that promotes cell-size-dependent targeting of TRAK2 mRNA to distal sites of cell protrusions. Cell-size-scaled mRNA polarisation in turn scales mitochondria distribution by defining the precise site of TRAK2-MIRO1 retrograde transport complex assembly. Consequently, 3UTR motif excision perturbs size-regulated transport and eradicates scaling of mitochondria positioning, triggering distal accumulation of mitochondria and progressive hypermotility as cells increase size. Together, our results reveal an RNA-driven mechanistic basis for the cell-size-scaling of organelle distribution and function that is critical to homeostatic control of motile cell behaviour."
"Advances in machine learning are providing new abilities for engineering biology, promising leaps forward with beneficial applications. At the same time, these advances raise concerns about biosecurity. Recently, Wittmann et al. described an in silico pipeline of generative AI tools to demonstrate how amino acid sequences encoding sequences of concern (SOCs) could be reformulated as synthetic homologs that may evade detection by biosecurity screening software (BSS) used by nucleic acid synthesis providers. While the discovered vulnerability has been mitigated, its true severity remains unclear, as the study was performed without experimental testing of the synthetic homologs. Here, we present a testing, evaluation, validation, and verification (TEVV) framework for AI-assisted protein design (AIPD), using safe proteins as SOC proxies. Our findings indicate AIPD can generate synthetic homologs whose predicted structures are similar to a native template, but without necessarily retaining activity. We determine that current AIPD systems are not yet powerful enough to reliably rewrite the sequence of a given protein, while both maintaining activity and evading detection by BSS. We further conclude that TEVV of generated sequences requires significant investment of time, technical skill, and resources. We offer our framework and test proteins as a general benchmark of AIPD capability."
"Rust fungi comprise thousands of species many of which cause disease on important crop plants. The flax rust fungus Melampsora lini has been a model species for the genetic dissection of plant immunity since the 1940s, however the highly fragmented and incomplete reference genome has so far hindered progress in effector gene discovery. Here, we generate a fully-phased, chromosome-scale assembly of the two nuclear genomes of M. lini strain CH5, resolving an additional 320 Mbp of sequence compared to the previous short-read assembly. The 482 Mbp dikaryotic genome is at least 79% repetitive with a large proportion ([~]40%) of the genome comprised of young, highly similar transposable elements. The assembly resolves the known effector gene loci some of which carry complex duplications that were collapsed in the previous assembly. Using a genetic map followed by manual correction of gene models, we identify the AvrM3 and AvrN genes which encode unusually large fungal effector proteins and trigger defense responses when co-expressed with the corresponding resistance genes in Nicotiana tabacum. We locate the genes linked to the tetrapolar mating system on chromosomes 4 and 9, but in contrast to the cereal rusts which have one pheromone receptor gene per haplotype, in flax rust three pheromone receptor genes are found with two of them closely linked on one haplotype. Taken together, we show that a high-quality assembly is crucial for resolving complex gene loci and given the increasing number of fungal effectors of large size, the commonly applied criterion for effector candidates as being small proteins as needs to be reconsidered."
"Following thymic egress, CD8+ T cells must undergo a post-thymic maturation process to transition from a recent thymic emigrant (RTE) to a mature naive T cell. Since the neonatal T cell pool is comprised of significantly more RTEs, the prevailing notion is that neonatal CD8+ T cells behave differently than their adult counterparts simply because they have undergone less post-thymic maturation. To test this theory, we leveraged a fate mapping mouse model and paired single cell transcriptome and TCR sequencing to compare neonatal and adult CD8+ RTEs that have undergone the same amount of post-thymic maturation. Interestingly, we found that neonatal and adult CD8+ RTEs exhibit distinct phenotypes, gene expression profiles, TCR usage, and functions. These data suggest that neonatal CD8+ T cells are not simply immature adult CD8+ T cells and that age-related changes in CD8+ T cell functions in early life cannot be attributed solely to differences in the amount of post-thymic maturation."
"Disruption of sleep and circadian rhythms is one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimers disease (AD). Circadian entrainment and the modulation of alertness are non-visual responses to light driven by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). However, little is known about ipRGCs in the context of AD. To explore structural and functional changes of ipRGCs and ipRGC circuits, we analyzed the retinas and brains of 13 elderly patients (9 males, 4 females, aged 69-103) ranging from normal to neuropathologically defined AD.

We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on freshly harvested retinas using multi-electrode arrays. While rod and cone responses were moderately affected, we found a decreased density of ipRGCs in donors with advanced AD pathology, which was confirmed by immunostaining. The remaining ipRGCs displayed morphological alterations as well as abnormal responses to light, including hyperexcitability. These changes appeared to be subtype-specific and correlated with the advancement of the disease.

Altered ipRGCs circuits and function could contribute to the disruption of sleep and circadian rhythms reported in AD patients. The measurement of ipRGC-dependent responses to light could constitute a promising tool to predict or monitor pathological changes in the brain."
"Non-linear dynamical methods such as Higuchis fractal dimension (HFD) are often used to study the complexities of brain activity. In human electroencephalogram (EEG), while power in the gamma band (30-70 Hz) and the slope of the power spectral density (PSD) have been shown to reduce with healthy aging, there are conflicting findings regarding how HFD and other measures of complexity vary with aging. Further, the dependence of HFD on features obtained from PSD (such as gamma power and slope) has not been thoroughly probed. To address these issues, we computed time and frequency resolved HFD for EEG data collected from elderly population (N=217), aged between 50-88 years, for baseline (BL) eyes open state and during a fixation task in which visual grating stimuli that induce strong gamma oscillations were presented. During BL, HFD increased with age for frequencies up to 150 Hz, but surprisingly showed an opposite trend at higher frequencies. Interestingly, this change in HFD was opposite to the age-related change in PSD 1/f slope. Further, stimulus-related changes in HFD were anti-correlated with the changes in oscillatory power. However, age classification using HFD was slightly better than classification using spectral features (power and slope). Further, stimulus and age-related changes in HFD persisted even after normalization with surrogates, showing the effect of non-linear dynamics on HFD. Therefore, HFD could be jointly sensitive to various spectral features as well as some non-linearities not captured using spectral analysis, which could enhance our understanding of brain dynamics underlying healthy aging."
"Arginine, glutamic acid and selenocysteine based codon bias has been shown to regulate the translation of specific mRNAs for proteins that participate in stress responses, cell cycle and transcriptional regulation. Defining codon-bias in gene networks has the potential to identify other pathways under translational control. Here we have used computational methods to analyze the ORFeome of all unique human (19,711) and mouse (22,138) open-reading frames (ORFs) to characterize codon-usage and codon-bias in genes and biological processes. We show that ORFeome-wide clustering of gene-specific codon frequency data can be used to identify ontology-enriched biological processes and gene networks, with developmental and immunological programs well represented for both humans and mice. We developed codon over-use ontology mapping and hierarchical clustering to identify multi-codon bias signatures in human and mouse genes linked to signaling, development, mitochondria and metabolism, among others. The most distinct multi-codon bias signatures were identified in human genes linked to skin development and RNA metabolism, and in mouse genes linked to olfactory transduction and ribosome, highlighting species-specific pathways potentially regulated by translation. Extreme codon bias was identified in genes that included transcription factors and histone variants. We show that re-engineering extreme usage of C- or U-ending codons for aspartic acid, asparagine, histidine and tyrosine in the transcription factors CEBPB and MIER1, respectively, significantly regulates protein levels. Our study highlights that multi-codon bias signatures can be linked to specific biological pathways and that extreme codon bias with regulatory potential exists in transcription factors for immune response and development.

"SignificanceInfrared neural stimulation (INS) has emerged as a potent neuromodulation technology, offering safe and focal stimulation with superior spatial recruitment profiles compared to conventional electrical methods. However, the neural dynamics induced by INS stimulation remain poorly understood. Elucidating these dynamics will help develop new INS stimulation paradigms and advance its clinical application.

AimIn this study, we assessed the local network dynamics of INS entrainment in the auditory thalamocortical circuit using the chronically implanted rat model; our approach focused on measuring INS energy-based local field potential (LFP) recruitment induced by focal thalamocortical stimulation. We further characterized linear and nonlinear oscillatory LFP activity in response to single-pulse and periodic INS and performed spectral decomposition to uncover specific LFP band entrainment to INS. Finally, we examined spike-field transformations across the thalamocortical synapse using spike-LFP coherence coupling.

ResultsWe found that INS significantly increases LFP amplitude as a log-linear function of INS energy per pulse, primarily entraining to LFP {beta} and{gamma} bands with synchrony extending to 200 Hz in some cases. A subset of neurons demonstrated nonlinear, chaotic oscillations linked to information transfer across cortical circuits. Finally, we utilized spike-field coherences to correlate spike coupling to LFP frequency band activity and suggest an energy-dependent model of network activation resulting from INS stimulation.

ConclusionsWe show that INS reliably drives robust network activity and can potently modulate cortical field potentials across a wide range of frequencies in a stimulus parameter-dependent manner. Based on these results, we propose design principles for developing full coverage, all-optical thalamocortical auditory neuroprostheses."
"Identification of the genomic regions that contribute to reproductive isolation and how they interact is a major goal of evolutionary genetics. Much effort has focused on locating candidate genes and potential barrier loci by scanning genomes for regions of excess differentiation (FST). An alternative, and perhaps more robust approach, would be to scan for genomic regions exhibiting steep clines in allele frequency across a hybrid zone. Here we develop this approach and apply it to genomic data from across a hybrid zone between varieties of Antirrhinum majus subspecies majus with different flower colour patterns (A. m. m var. pseudomajus and A. m. m var. striatum). Most steep clines are clustered in seven genomic regions, only four of which were present from FST scans between all pair-wise comparisons. Six of these regions carry previously identified loci that influence flower colour in the hybrid zone. The seventh region harbours a novel locus, RUBIA, modifying magenta intensity. Clines at RUBIA approached towards fixation on magenta side of the hybrid zone, whilst remaining polymorphic on the yellow side. This polymorphism on the yellow side may reflect a smaller phenotypic effect of RUBIA in yellow compared to magenta genetic backgrounds. Our findings illustrate how whole-genome cline scans in hybrid zones can robustly detect genomic regions contributing to phenotypic differences and highlight how different reproductive barrier loci interact across the genome."
"In the past decades, active exoskeletons have been dedicated to reducing human effort, in particular to assist workers in occupational environments. However, this approach does not promote the learning of more ergonomic postures by workers, which is critical for the long-term prevention of musculoskeletal disorders. Alternatively, we propose to use exoskeletons as biofeedback systems, generating task-relevant perturbations guiding users towards ergonomic postures. To test this approach, participants performed reach-to-hold movements towards a redundant target, allowing multiple final postures. We then introduced vibrations with posture-dependent intensity, generating a sensorimotor disturbance that canceled out either above or below each participants nominal preferred posture. Interestingly, participants adapted to minimize the vibrations, whether it increased or decreased the gravity efforts, and retained the novel posture when it induced lower effort. Finally, all participants significantly reduced effort post-exposure, demonstrating the feasibility and the benefits of using exoskeleton as biofeedback systems to improve posture."
"Numerous X-ray crystal structures of the c-Src SH3 domain have provided a large sampling of atomic-level information for this important signaling domain. Multiple crystal forms have been reported, with variable crystal lattice contacts and chemical crystallization conditions. Here, we report a unique crystal structure of Src SH3 domain in trigonal space group H32 to 1.45 [A] resolution. Crystal packing and anomalous scattering reveal that this crystal form is mediated by two ordered nickel ions provided by the crystallization buffer. Nickel coordination occurs in a 2:2 stoichiometry which dimerizes two SH3 domain monomers across a pseudo-twofold rotation axis and involves the native N-terminal c-Src SH3 amino acid sequence, a surface-exposed histidine residue, and ordered water molecules. This study provides an example of metal binding by N-terminal protein residues that contrasts the amino terminal copper and nickel binding (ATCUN) motif and is an alternative avenue for crystallization of the Src SH3 domain.

"Virus infections reduce honey bee (Apis mellifera) ovary mass (in part due to resource-allocation trade-offs with immunity) and are linked to the presence of supersedure cells in colonies, indicating that workers are attempting to replace their queen. Pheromones, lipids, and lipid transport proteins could mediate relationships among virus infection, ovary mass, and supersedure. When we infected honey bee queens in the laboratory and profiled their queen retinue pheromone (QRP) components from head extracts, we found that virus infections specifically reduced the QRP component methyl oleate. Data from an observational field study were consistent with this pattern. Lipidomics analysis of the same extracts suggests that virus infection decreases triacylglycerol abundances (major sources of stored energy). Reducing ovary mass via laying restriction was sufficient to lower methyl oleate abundance [-] suggesting that virus infection reduces methyl oleate indirectly via ovary effects [-] but was insufficient to reduce abundance of most triacylglycerols or stimulate immune effector expression. Abundance of circulating apolipophorin-III, a lipid transporter and putative potentiator of immune effectors, was lower in queens with restricted laying, suggesting that its expression may be controlled by nutrient availability while its immune-stimulating capacity is governed by other mechanisms. Prior research has shown that queen pheromone blends lacking methyl oleate are less attractive to workers; therefore, diminishing methyl oleate could result in a less desirable pheromone bouquet and possibly stimulate supersedure. The mechanism of methyl oleate reduction is yet to be determined, but is clearly tied to ovary size and possibly resource availability or mobilization."
"The evolution of human influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) involves simultaneous selection to acquire antigenic mutations that escape population immunity while preserving protein function and stability. Epistasis shapes this evolution, as an antigenic mutation that is deleterious in one genetic background may become tolerated in another. However, the extent to which epistasis can alleviate pleiotropic conflicts between immune escape and protein function/stability is unclear. Here, we measure how all amino acid mutations in the HA of a recent human H3N2 influenza strain affect its cell entry function, acid stability, and neutralization by human serum antibodies. We find that epistasis has enabled emergence of antigenic mutations that were detrimental to HAs cell entry function in earlier strains. However, epistasis appears insufficient to overcome the pleiotropic costs of antigenic mutations that impair HAs stability, explaining why some mutations that strongly escape human antibodies never fix in nature. Our results refine our understanding of the mutational constraints that shape influenza evolution: epistasis can enable antigenic change, but pleiotropic effects can restrict its trajectory."
"Transmembrane glycoproteins of enveloped viruses are the targets of neutralizing antibodies and essential vaccine antigens. mRNA-LNP technology allows in situ production of transmembrane glycoproteins upon immunization, but biophysical characterization of transmembrane antigens and in vitro analysis of post-immunization antibody responses typically rely on soluble proteins. Here, we present a methodological platform for assembling transmembrane glycoprotein vaccine candidates into lipid nanodiscs. We demonstrate the utility of the nanodiscs in HIV membrane proximal external region (MPER)-targeting vaccine development by binding assays using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), ex vivo B cell sorting with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and by determining the structure of a prototypical HIV MPER-targeting immunogen nanodisc in complex with three broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), including the MPER bnAb 10E8, to 3.5 [A] by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), providing a template for structure-based immunogen design for MPER. Overall, the platform offers a tool for accelerating the development of next-generation viral vaccines."
"Protein-level cellular dynamics, including multimerization, play a crucial role in rapid adaptation of plants during developmental transitions and environmental stresses. The gaseous hormone ethylene is a key regulator of these rapid cellular adjustments, especially in growth inhibition. During soil emergence, etiolated seedlings undergo crucial morphological changes to their apical hooks and hypocotyls, with ethylene inhibiting hypocotyl axial elongation while promoting radial expansion. Ethylene triggers these growth responses within two hours; however, the protein machineries and cellular processes that mediate morphogenesis control are not known. Here, we used quantitative proteomics and co-fractionation mass spectrometry to test for rapid ethylene-dependent changes in protein abundance and protein complex composition. Protein multimerization responses were numerous and diverse. There were instances of protein complex assembly and disassembly, with varying degrees of completeness. Small-scale validation tests indicate that the identified proteins play a role in hypocotyl development and suggest that this novel approach to gene discovery identifies potential targets for ethylene-mediated growth regulation and enhanced seedling adaptability during early development."
"Biosynthesis of lipids and fatty acids (FAs) is a tightly regulated and complex process essential for the normal functioning of various cellular processes as is sufficient lipid availability for the progression of several malignant tumor types. Despite its importance, the roles of the individual steps in lipid biosynthesis during tumor growth and their subsequent interaction with intracellular signaling pathways are still not well understood. In our study, we used the RasV12, Scribble deficient carcinoma model in Drosophila to demonstrate that upregulation of de novo FA and lipid synthesis is a conserved characteristic of malignant tumors. Performing a small-scale genetic screen by tumor cell specific silencing of components of neutral lipid biosynthetic apparatus revealed that the loss of several enzymes involved in FA and diacylglycerol synthesis significantly inhibited tumor growth. Further characterization of the role of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the enzyme responsible for the first step of FA synthesis, revealed that loss of ACC significantly reduced late-stage tumor growth due to increased apoptotic activity. However, early tumor development was unaffected. This correlated with our observation that perturbation of FA synthesis led to inactivation of TORC1 (Target of Rapamycin Complex 1) - the master regulator of cell growth and survival - accompanied by activation of the catabolic process autophagy. Moreover, we also demonstrated that TORC1 activity cannot be restored by hyperactivation of upstream Insulin/PI3K signaling or inhibition of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) in ACC deficient tumor cells but supplementation of ACC deficient tumors with ectopically added oleic acid alone could improve TORC1 activity and thereby tumor progression. Hence, our findings highlight a new role of FAs in regulating TORC1, rendering it receptive to upstream activatory signals, explaining why cancer cells are extremely dependent on de novo FA synthesis."
"In the Syngap+/- model of SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability (SRID), excessive neuronal protein synthesis is linked to deficits in synaptic plasticity. Here, we use Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification and RNA-seq (TRAP-seq) to identify mistranslating mRNAs in Syngap+/- CA1 pyramidal neurons that exhibit enhanced synaptic stability and impaired long-term potentiation (LTP). We find the translation environment is significantly altered in a manner that is distinct from the Fmr1-/y model of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), another monogenic model of autism and intellectual disability (ID). The Syngap+/- translatome is enriched for regulators of DNA repair, and mimics changes induced with chemical LTP (cLTP) in WT. This includes a striking upregulation in the translation of mRNAs with a longer length (>2kb) coding sequence (CDS). In contrast, long CDS transcripts are downregulated with induction of Gp1 metabotropic glutamate receptor induced long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) in WT, and this profile is mimicked in the Fmr1-/y model. Together, our results show the Syngap+/- and Fmr1-/y models mimic the translation environments of LTP and LTD, respectively, consistent with the dysregulation of these plasticity states in each model. Moreover, we show that translation of >2kb mRNAs is a defining feature of LTP that is oppositely regulated during LTD, revealing a novel mRNA signature of plasticity."
"The integrity of cellular membranes (lipid bilayers) and myelin sheaths covering axons is a crucial feature controlling normal brain structural and functional networks. Yet, in vivo evaluation of this integrity at the nanoscale level of the cellular membranes organization is challenging.

Herein we explore the dual property of biological water in Central Nervous System (CNS), as one of the major stabilizing factors of cellular membranes, and the major source of MRI signal. We introduce the Basic Transient Hydrogen Bond (THB) model of the MR signal relaxation due to the quantum spin/magnetization exchanges within the THB Matrix encompassing water molecules and membrane-forming macromolecules.

Our data show the existence of two THB Matrix components with distinct lifetimes - one in a few nano-second range, and another in the range of tens nanoseconds. Importantly, the former component facilitates longitudinal relaxation of MR signal, the latter contributes to its transverse relaxation and causes the anisotropy of MR signal relaxation. These distinct features offer opportunity to study nanoscale level microstructure of cellular membranes. Furthermore, the ability to differentiate distinct THB Matrix components based on their MR signal relaxation properties can be fundamental to identifying pathological changes and enhancing disease visibility on MRI scans."
"Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of healthcare-associated pneumonia, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality worldwide. As a ubiquitous colonizer of the upper respiratory tract, S. aureus must undergo substantial metabolic adaptation to achieve persistent infection in the distinctive microenvironment of the lung. We observed that fumC, which encodes the enzyme that converts fumarate to malate, is highly conserved with low mutation rates in S. aureus isolates from chronic lung infections. Fumarate, a pro-inflammatory metabolite produced by macrophages during infection, is regulated by the host fumarate hydratase (FH) to limit inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that fumarate, which accumulates in the chronically infected lung, is detrimental to S. aureus, blocking primary metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). This creates a metabolic bottleneck that drives staphylococcal FH (FumC) activity for airway adaptation. FumC not only degrades fumarate but also directs its utilization into critical pathways including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, gluconeogenesis and hexosamine synthesis to maintain metabolic fitness and form a protective biofilm. Itaconate, another abundant immunometabolite in the infected airway enhances FumC activity, in synergy with fumarate. In a mouse model of pneumonia, a {Delta}fumC mutant displays significant attenuation compared to its parent and complemented strains, particularly in fumarate- and itaconate-replete conditions. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of immunometabolites in promoting S. aureus pulmonary adaptation."
"Cryo-FIB milling of biological specimens is a critical and limiting step in the cryo-electron tomography workflow. Preparing electron-transparent cryo-lamellae is a serial, low-throughput process. Even with automation, a skilled operator can typically only produce 15-25 lamellae in a single cryo-FIB session. During sample handling, milling and transfer, the cryo-fixed cells as well as the supporting film layer face various mechanical forces and thermal stresses due to temperature fluctuations. Moreover, after cells are cryo-FIB milled, the resulting thin lamellae continue to endure external forces from mechanical handling and thermal stress. We propose a simple, yet highly effective modification to the standard rectangular milling pattern by implementing ""fillets"" or corner smoothing providing better mechanical stability. This adjustment helps to avoid sharp corners at the lamella edges, thereby reducing stress concentration. As a result, this modification decreases the likelihood of lamella breakage and improves the overall yield of ready-for-TEM lamellae by 33% as verified experimentally."
"Descending neurons (DNs) occupy a key position in the sensorimotor hierarchy, conveying signals from the brain to the rest of the body below the neck. In Drosophila melanogaster flies, approximately 480 DN cell types have been described from electron-microscopy image datasets. Genetic access to these cell types is crucial for further investigation of their role in generating behaviour. We previously conducted the first large-scale survey of Drosophila melanogaster DNs, describing 98 unique cell types from light microscopy and generating cell-type-specific split-Gal4 driver lines for 65 of them. Here, we extend our previous work, describing the morphology of 146 additional DN types from light microscopy, bringing the total number DN types identified in light microscopy datasets to 244, or roughly 50% of all DN types. In addition, we produced 500 new sparse split-Gal4 driver lines and compiled a list of previously published DN lines from the literature for a combined list of 806 split-Gal4 driver lines targeting 190 DN types."
"Gene genealogies represent the ancestry of a sample and are often encoded as ancestral recombination graphs (ARG). It has recently become possible to infer these gene genealogies from sequencing or genotyping data and use them for evolutionary and statistical genetics. Unfortunately, inferred gene genealogies can be noisy and subject to biases, making their applications more challenging. This project aims to study the application of ARG methods to systematically impute and trace the transmission of all disease variants in founder populations where long-shared haplotypes allow for accurate timing of relatedness. We applied these methods to the population of Quebec, where multiple founder events led to an uneven distribution of pathogenic variants across regions and where extensive population pedigrees are available. We validated our approach with nine founder mutations for the SLSJ region, demonstrating high accuracy for mutation age, imputation, and regional frequency estimation. Moreover, we showed that this subset of high-quality carriers is sufficient to capture previously described associations with pathogenic variants in the LPL gene. This method systematically characterizes rare variants in founder populations, establishing a fast and accurate approach to inform genetic screening programs."
"DNA damage is a major risk factor for the decline of neuronal functions with age and neurodegenerative diseases. The connection between DNA damage and neurodegeneration is extensively investigated, however, the mechanisms limiting the propagation of damaged DNA from highly replicative neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) to post-mitotic neurons remains largely unknown. Here, we describe that enzymatic activity of the histone deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is important for the homologues recombination-dependent repair of double- stranded DNA breaks induced by etoposide. Furthemore, SIRT1 abolishes neuronal fate of murine NSPCs following induction of DNA damage. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic inactivation of SIRT1 rescues etoposide-mediated inhibition of neuronal differentiation in NSPCs and hippocampal slice cultures and promotes transcription of pro-neuronal genes. Inhibition of Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), the central regulator of the DNA damage response, mimics the SIRT-dependent effect of DNA damage on neuronal differentiation, indicating that the ATM/SIRT1 axis inhibits formation of neuronal cells harbouring damaged DNA. These data are consistent with the role of SIRT1 in genome stability, healthy ageing and protection from the development of ageing-associated neurodegenerative diseases."
"Clinical features of FXS phenotype include intellectual disability, repetitive behaviors, social communication deficit and also commonly manifested auditory hypersensitivity for acoustic stimuli. The electrophysiological studies have shown that FXS patients and Fmr1 KO mice display improper processing of auditory information in the cortical areas of the brain and the spiral ganglion of cochlea. Synapses formed by spiral ganglion neurons on sensory hair cells (HC) are the first connection on the path that conveys the auditory information from the sensory cells to the brain. We confirmed the presence of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) in the inner hair cells of the cochlea. Next, we analyzed the morphology of IHC ribbon synapses in early stages of postnatal development (P5, P14) and detected their delayed developmental maturation in Fmr1 KO mice. Interestingly the ultrastructure of inner hair cell ribbon synapses studied by electron microscopy in the adult mice have shown no specific dysmorphologies. Delayed maturation of presynaptic ribbons of auditory hair cells in Fmr1 KO mice may contribute to abnormal development of circuits induced by auditory experience."
"Serratia marcescens is a healthcare-associated pathogen that can cause severe infections including bacteremia and pneumonia. The capsule polysaccharide of S. marcescens is a bacteremia fitness determinant and previous work defined capsule locus (KL) diversity within the species. Strains belonging to KL1 and KL2 capsule clades produce sialylated polysaccharides and represent the largest subpopulation of isolates from clinical origin. In this study, the contribution of these and other S. marcescens capsules to infection was determined in animal and cellular models. Using a murine model of primary bacteremia, clinical isolates of multiple KL types demonstrated capsule-dependent colonization of spleen, liver, and kidney following tail vein inoculation. Similar results were observed using a bacteremic pneumonia model, in that all tested strains of clinical origin demonstrated a requirement for capsule in both the primary lung infection site and for bloodstream dissemination to secondary organs. Finally, capsule from each KL clade was examined for the ability to resist internalization by bone marrow-derived macrophages. Only the sialylated KL1 and KL2 clade strains exhibited capsule-dependent inhibition of internalization, including KL2 capsule produced in a heterologous background. Together these findings indicate that lineage-specific resistance to macrophage phagocytosis may enhance survival and antibacterial defenses of clinically-adapted S. marcescens.

IMPORTANCEBacteremia occurs when the host immune system fails to contain bacterial bloodstream replication following an initial inoculation event from either an internal or external source. Capsule polysaccharides play a protective role for Serratia marcescens during bacteremia but there is abundant genetic diversity at the capsule-encoding locus within the species. This study compares the infection characteristics of S. marcescens isolates belonging to five capsule types and defines the contributions to infection fitness for each. By characterizing the differences in capsule dependence and infection potential between S. marcescens strains, efforts to combat these life-threatening infections can be focused toward identifying strategies that target the most critical genetic lineages of this important opportunistic pathogen."
"Exercise induces organism-wide molecular adaptations, partly mediated by humoral factors released in response to acute and chronic physical activity. However, the extent and specificity of endocrine effects from training-induced secreted factors remain unclear. Here, we applied systems genetics approaches to quantify inter-organ endocrine networks using multi-tissue transcriptomics and proteomics data collected from endurance-trained rats in The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC). Eight weeks of endurance training significantly altered both the magnitude and specificity of endocrine effects across multiple origin-target tissue pairs. Subcutaneous white adipose tissue emerged as a key endocrine regulator impacted by training, while extracellular matrix-derived factors were identified as globally regulated secretory features in trained vs sedentary animals. Notably, secretory Wnt signaling factors were identified as key mediators of exercise-induced endocrine adaptations in multiple tissues. Our systems genetics framework provides an unprecedented atlas of inter-organ communication significantly remodeled by endurance exercise, serving as a valuable resource for novel exerkine discovery."
"Methionine is essential for the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) inside the host. However, the transsulfuration pathway, a major contributor of methionine, is dispensable for the growth of M. tuberculosis suggesting redundancy in the methionine biosynthesis pathway. Orthologues of MetZTB in other bacterial species are known to operate a redundant single-step methionine biosynthesis pathway called direct sulfhydrylation. In this study, we demonstrate that genetic disruption of the metZ-mediated direct sulfhydrylation pathway in M. tuberculosis hinders growth at low pH, an effect mitigated by methionine supplementation. Computational analyses, including in-silico molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, reveal enhanced binding of the MetZ substrate, O-succinyl homoserine (OSH), to the active site of MetZ at acidic pH. Intriguingly, despite increased intracellular ATP levels, a relative decrease in the frequency of Bedaquiline (BDQ)-induced persisters is observed in metZ-deficient strain, suggesting a role of direct sulfhydrylation pathway in modulating BDQ sensitivity. Finally, we demonstrated that the absence of metZ impedes the ability of M. tuberculosis to grow inside the host."
"Predictive-coding like theories agree in describing top-down communication through the cortical hierarchy as a transmission of predictions generated by internal models of the inputs. With respect to the bottom-up connections, however, these theories differ in the neural processing strategies suggested for updating the internal model. Some theories suggest a coding strategy where unpredictable inputs, i.e., those not captured by the internal model, are passed on through the cortical hierarchy, whereas others claim that the predictable part of the inputs is passed on. Here, we addressed which neural coding strategy is employed in cortico-cortical connections using an information-theoretic approach. Our framework allows for quantifying two core aspects of both strategies, namely, predictability of inputs and information transfer, through local active information storage and local transfer entropy, respectively. A previous study on the neural processing of retinal ganglion cells connected to the lateral geniculate nucleus showed a coding for predictable information, captured by an increase in the information transfer with the predictability of inputs. Here, we further investigate predictive coding strategies at the cortical level. In particular, we analyzed LFP activity obtained from intracranial EEG recordings in humans and spike recordings from mouse cortex. We detected cortico-cortical connections with increasing information transfer with the predictability of inputs in recorded channels from frontal, parietal and temporal areas in human cortex. In the mouse visual system, we detected connections exhibiting both an increase and decrease in the information transfer with input predictability, although the former was pre-dominant. Our evidence supports the presence of both predictive coding strategies at the cortical level, with a potential predominance of encoding for predictable information.

SummaryThe ability of the brain to infer the hidden causes of sensory experiences has been conceptualized within the computational framework of predictive coding. This framework explains perceptual inference and learning as a process of constantly updating an internal model of the world. Predictive coding describes cortical activity as a communication of sensory evidence and predictions generated from prior expectations. While different views of predictive coding agree on the communication of prior expectations throughout cortex, they differ in how internal expectations are updated. One view states that, to update the internal model, the cortex propagates the mismatch between the expected neural activity and the actual neural response to sensory stimuli. In contrast, another view suggests that the cortex propagates the match between the expected neural activity and the actual neural response. In this work, we were able to tease apart these two views, both in human cortex and the mouse visual system, using information theory. We observed that the brain predominantly propagates expected information, i.e., the match between prior expectations and incoming sensory inputs."
"The functional capacity of highly proliferative cell populations changes with age. Here, we report that the proliferative capacity of canine lung mesenchymal stromal cells (LMSCs) declines with increasing age of the donor. However, other functional changes such as reduced autophagy, reduced migration/wound healing, increased production of reactive oxygen species, and increased senescence are not significantly altered with increasing age. Furthermore, transcriptomic profiling suggests minimal age-related changes. These data suggest that the reduced proliferative capacity of lung LMSCs isolated from aging donors may be associated with reversible cell cycle arrest (quiescence), rather than irreversible cell cycle arrest (senescence). Similar findings have been reported in other systems, including neural and muscle stem cells that are associated with low turnover-rate tissues."
"Sequence design is the critical first step in developing a new mRNA medicine. The mRNA primary sequence is assembled from multiple elements, including the coding sequence of the target protein or gene, flanking untranslated regions that impact expression, and the poly(A) tail, which improves stability. The mRNA primary sequence can be optimized to improve the performance of an mRNA medicine, including increasing translation and stability, and reducing reactogenicity. Here, we introduce mRNArchitect, a software toolkit to assist in the design of mRNA sequences. mRNArchitect can rapidly assemble and optimize mRNA sequences based on user requirements, including GC content, secondary structure, codon optimization, and uridine depletion. The sequences generated by mRNArchitect can also be readily synthesized, and have been experimentally validated across a variety of applications. We present mRNArchitect as a software toolkit to help scientists design new mRNA medicines.

Availability and implementationmRNArchitect is available via a web portal at www.basefacility.org.au/software/ and Github at https://github.com/BaseUQ/mRNArchitect. mRNArchitect is open-source and freely available under MIT License."
"In the context of adaptation to climate change, acute hyperthermia and hypoxia resistance are traits of growing interest in aquaculture. The feasibility of genetic improvement of these resistance traits through selection has been demonstrated in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The present paper aims to test whether behaviour may be associated with acute hyperthermia and hypoxia resistance to better characterize these resistance phenotypes.

For this, six rainbow trout isogenic lines were phenotyped for behaviour variables and for acute hyperthermia and hypoxia resistance, using different individuals for each phenotype. The behaviour variables of the fish were phenotyped using an individual test in a new environment. The experimental design used 150 fish phenotyped per isogenic line for each resistance trait and 18 fish per isogenic line for behavioural traits, distributed in triplicates. Relations between acute hyperthermia and hypoxia resistance phenotypes and behaviour phenotypes were tested at the level of isogenic lines.

Significant differences in behaviour between isogenic lines were found, with some behaviour variables being highly associated with hypoxia resistance and moderately associated with acute hyperthermia resistance. Travelling distance, frequency of change between a risky and a safe zone of the tank and the percentage of time in movement in the behaviour test were strongly positively associated with acute hypoxia resistance. Travelling distance and frequency of change between a risky and a safe zone of the tank in the behaviour test were slightly negatively associated with acute hyperthermia resistance. This previously unstudied link between behaviour and resistance phenotypes also suggests that some behaviour variables could be used as predictors for acute hyperthermia and hypoxia resistance in fish. This result could lead to more ethical acute hyperthermia and hypoxia resistance phenotyping protocols, as the current protocols in use are classified as severe by French ethics committees."
"Large and giant double-stranded DNA viruses within the phylum Nucleocytoviricota are diverse and prevalent in the environment where they substantially affect the ecology and evolution of eukaryotes1-4. Until now, these viruses were only sporadically found in the digestive system of vertebrates5-7. Here, we present the discovery of a diversified group of Nucleocytoviricota viruses dubbed egoviruses that almost exclusively occur in the digestive system of vertebrates worldwide. Egoviruses are most closely related to poxviruses and represent a third order within the class Pokkesviricetes8. They contain large linear genomes that include genes linked to multilayered icosahedral capsids only observed in asfuviruses. The widespread occurrence of egovirus genes in genomes of metamonads (with signal particularly enriched among Trichomonas and Tritrichomonas), and their co-existence in human fecal samples as demonstrated by our metagenomic survey point towards a preferential infection of unicellular eukaryotes known to prevail, often as symbionts or pathogens, in the gut of vertebrates worldwide9. Notably, the numerous Egovirales genes found throughout Trichomonas vaginalis genomes (>3% of their gene pools) designate this prominent sexually transmitted human pathogen as a likely vector to the spread of egoviruses. Notably, one egovirus clade is human-specific, evolutionarily constrained, and spread across continents, demonstrating a long-term association with the human population at a global scale. Egoviruses represent the only diverse, widespread, and abundant group of double-stranded DNA viruses infecting eukaryotes in the digestive system of vertebrates, with implications for human health, capsid evolution and the origin of poxviruses."
"High-resolution extracellular electrophysiology is the gold standard for recording spikes from distributed neural populations, and is especially powerful when combined with optogenetics for manipulation of specific cell types with high temporal resolution. We integrated these approaches into prototype Neuropixels Opto probes, which combine electronic and photonic circuits. These devices pack 960 electrical recording sites and two sets of 14 light emitters onto a 1 cm shank, allowing spatially addressable optogenetic stimulation with blue and red light. In mouse cortex, Neuropixels Opto probes delivered high-quality recordings together with spatially addressable optogenetics, differentially activating or silencing neurons at distinct cortical depths. In mouse striatum and other deep structures, Neuropixels Opto probes delivered efficient optotagging, facilitating the identification of two cell types in parallel. Neuropixels Opto probes represent an unprecedented tool for recording, identifying, and manipulating neuronal populations."
"Wild plant species are threatened by diverse pathogens, but disease symptoms are rarely observed in nature. This suggests that wild plants harbor valuable sources of resistance. In this study, we show that a model bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pto) DC3000 triggered defense responses in all tested accessions of a wild Solanaceae species, Solanum americanum. Pto DC3000-triggered immunity in S. americanum required type III secretion system. We show that seven Pto DC3000 effectors (AvrPto, HopAD1, HopAM1, HopC1, HopAA1-1, HopM1, and AvrE1) triggered hypersensitive responses (HR) in S. americanum accession SP2273. Significantly, sequential deletion of the HR-triggering effectors from Pto DC3000 resulted in enhanced virulence in S. americanum. However, the well-conserved effectors, HopM1 and AvrE1 were indispensable for virulence. We conclude that the immunity triggered by multiple effectors contributes to nonhost resistance in S. americanum against P. syringae. We propose that the identification of the corresponding disease resistance genes for HopM1 and AvrE1 in S. americanum would accelerate development of durable immunity to P. syringae pathogens in Solanaceae crops."
"We report here on an attempt to create an engineered structure which can reproduce the physical and mechanical environment of the land plant sporangium. This work is part of a broader effort to understand the stress mechanics of the land plant sporangium and its role in initiating reproductive development. A second purpose is to extend the range of experimental methods available for the study of the physical environment of plant cell growth and the mechanics of trans-cellular signaling in plant development. We describe an experimental protocol, based on the microfluidic encapsulation of living plant protoplasts in multilayered microbeads composed of tunable hydrogel materials whose mechanical properties can be modified to mimic the stress-mechanics of the living sporangium. Our results demonstrate the successful encapsulation of living plant protoplasts in dual-layered microbeads consisting of an inner layer of gelled agarose and an outer layer of cross-linked alginate/methacrylate."
"Loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength is a debilitating consequence of various chronic diseases, inflammatory myopathies, and neuromuscular disorders. Inflammation plays a major role in the perpetuation of myopathy in degenerative muscle diseases. TAK1 is a major signaling protein that mediates the activation of multiple signaling pathways in response to inflammatory cytokines and microbial products. Recent studies have demonstrated that TAK1 is essential for the growth and maintenance of skeletal muscle mass in adult mice. However, the effects of overstimulation of TAK1 activity in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass remain unknown. In the present study, using AAV vectors, we investigated the effect of varying levels of TAK1 activation on skeletal muscle in adult mice. Our results demonstrate that while low levels of TAK1 activation improve skeletal muscle mass, sustained hyperactivation of TAK1 causes myopathy in adult mice. Excessive stimulation of TAK1 manifests pathological features, such as myofiber degeneration and regeneration, cellular infiltration, increased expression of proinflammatory molecules, and interstitial fibrosis. Hyperactivation of TAK1 also upregulates proteolytic systems and various catabolic signaling pathways in skeletal muscle of adult mice. Altogether, our study demonstrates that physiological levels of activation of TAK1 lead to myofiber hypertrophy, whereas its hyperactivation results in myofiber damage and other pathological features resembling inflammatory myopathies."
"F-statistics are commonly used to assess hybridization, admixture or introgression between populations or deeper evolutionary lineages. Their fast calculation from allele frequencies allows for rapid downstream admixture graph inference. One frequently overlooked assumption of the f4-test is a constant substitution rate. This assumption is typically questionable when comparing distantly-related lineages. Using simulations we find that rate variation across lineages decreases the accuracy of the f4-test to detect the presence of reticulations in large data sets or with high average mutation rate. But when f-statistics are combined to infer an admixture graph, rate variation across lineages has a small effect on accuracy. Network inference was accurate on a simple network with 1 reticulation only, but extremely inaccurate to infer a complex network with 4 reticulations, even from large data sets and without rate variation. Yet in both cases, the networks major tree was inferred reliably. Rate variation significantly increased the distance between the true and closest estimated network, the score gap between the true and best-scoring network, and the rate of incorrectly rejecting 1 reticulation as adequate, under our simple network. We propose that identifiability, or lack thereof is underlying the contrasting results between our simple and complex networks. Our findings suggest that the major tree is one feature that might be identifiable from f-statistics. In practice, we recommend evaluating a large set of top-scoring networks inferred from f-statistics, and even so, using caution in assuming that the true network is part of this set when inferred networks are complex. The extent of rate variation should be assessed in the system under study, especially at deeper time scales, in systems with rapid molecular evolution or with fast-evolving loci."
"Non-invasive measurement of the human brains angioarchitecture is critical for understanding the basis of functional neuroimaging signals, diagnosing cerebrovascular diseases, and tracking neurodegeneration. Ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has achieved mesoscopic (< 0.5 mm) imaging of angioarchitecture, revealing fine vascular details that were previously inaccessible in vivo. However, current mesoscopic MRI methods for imaging angioarchitecture face two major limitations. First, acquisition times are prohibitively long--often exceeding 40 minutes--making integration into everyday clinical practice and research projects impractical. Second, even with data successfully acquired, conventional data visualization methods--such as 2D slice browsing and 3D vessel segmentation renders--are rudimentary and have limited effectiveness for navigating and interpreting the complex vascular network. In this paper, we present a fast whole-brain MRI protocol that provides robust images of the brains venous network at 0.35 mm resolution in under seven minutes. Additionally, we introduce novel data processing and visualization techniques that enable identification of specific vessel types and more informative navigation of the complex vascular network. We demonstrate that, with these advancements, we can reproduce, in vivo and without intravenous contrast application, the seminal postmortem vasculature images of Duvernoy and Vannson (1999). Furthermore, leveraging the ability for MRI to cover the entire brain, we achieve, for the first time, whole-brain intracortical mesoscopic vein maps in humans. Our acquisition and post-processing methods lay the groundwork for detailed examination of vascular organization across individuals, brain regions, and cortical layers. More generally, these methods make mesoscopic imaging of angioarchitecture viable for broad neuroscientific and clinical applications."
"BackgroundThe diagnostic accuracy of screening and confirmatory tests to differentiate primary aldosteronism (PA) among patients with low-renin hypertension (HTN) is suboptimal. We aimed to assess the role of postural stimulation test (PST, previously used for PA subtyping) in differentiating PA from low-renin HTN.

Patients and methodsClinical and endocrine data in clinostatic position (CP) and orthostatic position (OP) during PST were evaluated in 190 hypertensive patients: 80 PA and 110 low-renin HTN. Multivariate techniques were computed: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and k-means clustering.

ResultsPST response differentiated our cohort: 96% of PA were detected in the 56/190 patients with always suppressed renin levels, 80% of patients with low-renin HTN were identified among 56/190 subjects with de-suppression of renin from CP to OP and 78/190 with always measurable renin. Increased potassium and measurable renin in OP were predictors of low-renin HTN. Cluster analysis distinguished PA from low-renin HTN: Cluster 2 included 104/110 low-renin HTN; Cluster 1 PA patients showed a higher frequency of suppressed renin levels at baseline and during PST (100% in CP and 95% in OP, respectively). Cluster 1 low-renin HTN patients had lower potassium and a higher frequency of suppressed renin levels at diagnosis and during PST, compared to Cluster 2. PLS-DA and PCA confirmed that renin in OP, renin response to PST and presence of hypokalemia were the most relevant parameters for distinguishing PA from low-renin HTN.

ConclusionRenin response during PST can be used to differentiate PA from low-renin HTN."
"O_LITransgenerational effects, non-evolutionary processes by which environmental conditions in one generation influence the performance in subsequent generations, are hypothesised to have substantial consequences for population dynamics under stochastic environments. However, any direct apparent detriment or advantage these processes generate for a focal species may be counteracted by concurrent effects upon interacting species.
C_LIO_LIUsing an experimental Drosophila-parasitoid model system, we determined how the previous generations thermal environment impacts the thermal performance of both hosts and parasitoids. We found substantial responses in both trophic-levels, with potential evidence for both condition-transfer effects and adaptive transgenerational plasticity.
C_LIO_LIWe used these results to parameterise discrete-time simulation models to explore how transgenerational effects of thermal conditions and temporal autocorrelation in temperature are expected to impact the time to extinction for this host-parasitoid system under climate change. The models predicted that transgenerational effects would significantly hasten the time to extinction, largely through a reduction in estimated average performance. Under the assumptions of one of the population dynamics models trialled, we identified an additional hastening of extinction from the combined effect of both host and parasitoid transgenerational effects.
C_LIO_LIOur research demonstrates how community-level consequences of transgenerational effects may impact a populations sensitivity to climate change under a fluctuating environment and highlights the need to quantify and contextualise thermal transgenerational effects in their ecological setting.

"Predicting personalized treatment-specific responses in cancer patients requires not only robust experimental models such as PDX, which generate accurate training data on different treatment responses for the same model, but also computational models that can translate this knowledge into decisions for real patients in a timely manner. The translatability of PDX data into patient-specific outcomes is limited by the challenges in the data size requirements for training machine learning models. Previously, ML models have been developed for the two most abundant cancer types, viz. BRCA and CRC, but the same could not be scaled up to other cancer types with a smaller number of PDX samples. Here, we provide an ML framework to train a single pan-cancer, pan-treatment model for predicting treatment outcomes. We show that such models give promising results for all cancer types considered and reproduce the accuracy levels of individually trained cancer types. In the proposed model, all PDX genomic profiles from all cancer types are used as the training data, and instead of partitioning them into cancer types for each model, the cancer type and treatment name are appended as the input features of the training model. Using genomic-only and treatment-only embeddings and combining them with PCA-based dimensionality reduction, our models show promising results and provide a framework for further improvements and real-time use for best treatment selections for cancer patients.

"Characterizing protein families structural and functional diversity is essential for understanding their biological roles. Traditional analyses often focus on primary and secondary structures, which may not fully capture complex protein interactions. Here we introduce InteracTor, a novel toolkit that extracts multimodal features from protein three-dimensional (3D) structures, including interatomic interactions like hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic contacts. By integrating Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, we quantified the importance of the extracted features in the classification of protein structural and functional families. InteracTors interpretable features enable mechanistic insights into the determinants of protein structure, function, and dynamics, offering a transparent means to assess their predictive power within machine learning models. Interatomic interaction features extracted by InteracTor demonstrated superior predictive power for protein family classification compared to features based solely on primary or secondary structure, revealing the importance of considering specific tertiary contacts in computational protein analysis. This work provides a robust framework for future studies aiming to enhance the capabilities of models for protein function prediction and drug discovery.

AUTHOR SUMMARYInteracTor is a computational toolkit designed to enhance our understanding of protein structure and function by focusing on three-dimensional (3D) structural interactions. Unlike traditional approaches that primarily rely on sequence or secondary structure data, InteracTor extracts biologically meaningful features such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic contacts, which are critical for protein stability and dynamics. By integrating these features into machine learning models alongside explainable AI methods, InteracTor provides interpretable insights into how specific structural interactions influence protein behavior. Our results demonstrate that tertiary structure features significantly improve the accuracy of protein family classification compared to sequence-based methods alone, underscoring the importance of considering 3D interactions in computational protein analyses. The toolkits modular design makes it adaptable for diverse applications, including drug discovery and protein engineering. In a broader context, InteracTor bridges the gap between computational biology and practical applications in medicine and biotechnology by offering a transparent and robust framework for analyzing proteins at a molecular level. This work represents a step forward in leveraging structural data to advance predictive modeling and biological discovery."
"Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a powerful tool to discriminate fluorescent molecules or probe their nanoscale environment. Traditionally, FLIM uses time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), which is precise but intrinsically low-throughput due to its dependence on point detectors. Although time-gated cameras have demonstrated the potential for high-throughput FLIM in bright samples with dense labeling, their use in single-molecule microscopy has not been explored extensively. Here, we report fast and accurate single-molecule FLIM with a commercial time-gated single-photon camera. Our optimized acquisition scheme achieves single-molecule lifetime measurements with a precision only about three times less than TCSPC, while imaging with a large number of pixels (512x512) allowing for the spatial multiplexing of over 3000 molecules. With this approach, we demonstrate parallelized lifetime measurements of large numbers of labeled pore-forming proteins on supported lipid bilayers, and temporal single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer measurements at 5-25 Hz. This method holds considerable promise for the advancement of multi-target single-molecule localization microscopy and biopolymer sequencing."
"The phylogenetic tree of eukaryotes is divided into a handful of highly diverse  supergroups; only a few so-called  orphan lineages branch in uncertain positions outside of these large clades. We found that the mitochondrial genome of one such lineage, the telonemids, is considerably gene-rich, a feature observed in other  orphans as well, raising the possibility that these organisms share a common history. On the contrary, our phylogenomic analyses show that  orphans with gene-rich mitochondria branch into two different positions: telonemids actually belong to the established supergroup Haptista, while provorans and meteorids form a strongly supported clade with hemimastigophorans, in a novel ancient supergroup that we dub here Promethea. Comparative genomics shows that this split reflects differences between mitochondrial gene sets. Thanks to the increased number of available representatives analyzed together, our results further simplify and illuminate the evolutionary relationships between eukaryotes."
"The entire auditory system downstream of the cochlea features pronounced offset responses, which follow the termination of sounds. Because of their ubiquity, it is still an unsolved question whether offset responses are generated early in the auditory system and then propagated or recomputed at each processing stage. Here, we analysed large-scale sound responses datasets acquired in the cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate nucleus and auditory cortex of awake mice. All brain regions showed a significant proportion of offset responses often combined with onset and sustained responses in the same neuron. However, using population activity decoders, we observed that neural representations after the sound offset show a three-fold increase in sound encoding accuracy in the cortex relative to subcortical areas. This result indicates that cortical offsets encode a more precise short-term memory of the elapsed sound than subcortical offsets and that they likely result from specific computational steps.

"The enzymatic degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) offers a sustainable solution for PET recycling. Over the past two decades, more than 100 PETases have been characterized, primarily exhibiting similar sequences and structures. Here, we report new PET-degrading /{beta} hydrolases, including HaloPETase1 from the marine Halopseudomonas lineage, thereby extending the narrow sequence space by novel features at the active site. The crystal structure of HaloPETase1 was determined to a resolution of 1.16 [A], revealing a unique active site architecture and a lack of the canonical {pi}-stacking clamp found in PETases so far. Further, variations in active site composition and loop structures were observed. Additionally, we found five more enzymes from the same lineage, two of which have a high similarity to type IIa bacterial PETases, while the other three resemble HaloPETase1. All these enzymes exhibited high salt tolerance ranging from 2.5 to 5 M NaCl leading to higher total product releases upon PET degradation at 40 or 50 {degrees}C. Based on these findings, we propose an extension of the existing PETase classification system to include type III PETases."
"Pathogenic chlamydial species restrict their peptidoglycan (PG) to the division septum of their replicative forms. PG is a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) and two of its major pattern recognition receptors in human cells are nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins 1 and 2 (NOD1 and NOD2, respectively). It has been proposed that this unique morphological feature is evidence of pathoadaptation by the microbe, permitting PG-dependent cell division while also reducing the bacteriums recognition by innate immune receptors. Chlamydia trachomatis-infected cells activate NOD1 signaling within 8-12 hours of exposure to the bacterium, roughly coinciding with the microbes transition from its infectious to replicative forms. Here we report that, unlike NOD1 signaling, Chlamydia-induced NOD2 signaling does not occur until later in the pathogens developmental cycle. Both C. trachomatis and the related murine pathogen Chlamydia muridarum signal late in infection in HEK293 reporter cell lines expressing either human or murine-derived NOD2 receptors. NOD2 signaling can be modulated by disruption of the chlamydial amidase enzyme, AmiACT, interrupting the microbes developmental cycle, and inducing RB lysis with inhibitors of lipooligosaccharide or peptidoglycan biosynthesis / assembly. These results mirror prior observations with Chlamydia-induced TLR9 signaling, leading us to hypothesize that Chlamydia-induced NOD2 signaling results from RB lytic events that occur sporadically during the RB to EB transition. Given our finding that pre-treating cells with NOD2-stimulatory ligands reduces chlamydial inclusion size, we hypothesize that the microbe preferentially degrades its PG during development to reduce the generation of NOD2 ligands, at the cost of enhancing NOD1 signaling."
"IntroductionVital pulp treatments (VPT) aim to conservatively manage deep caries and/or damage to preserve the vitality and function of the pulp. This minimally invasive approach is still debated when performing direct pulp capping (DPC), a treatment in which a protective biocompatible material is directly placed over the dental pulp, due to microbial risks inherent with pulp exposure and difficulties in sealing the exposure to protect the pulp from subsequent bacterial ingress. Several limitations associated with Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) such as long setting time and discoloration have promoted the development of next-generation MTA derivatives with enhanced physical, chemical, and biological properties. As these materials are relatively new, existing studies are limited in scope, lacking a comprehensive assessment of both reparative dentin formation and the sealing ability, which are critical parameters for determining long-term clinical success. These assessments require preclinical models, and while the mouse model offers the opportunity to explore the molecular mechanisms guiding reparative dentinogenesis, the materials and techniques optimized for human dentition present technical challenges in mice due to their small size.

AimWe aimed to optimize a DPC technique to use in mice by comparing the tissue responses and the sealing ability of three calcium silicate capping agents: Bioceramic putty (BC), Biodentine (BD), and Theracal-LC (TLC) to a control material known to seal well but cause desiccation that would lead to tissue damage; Cavit-G (CG).

Material and methodsDPC was performed on the maxillary first molar of C57BL/6 female mice. Reparative dentin was assessed with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histological assessment of dentin bridge formation at 21 days. The sealing ability of the capping materials was evaluated using micro-CT.

ResultsAll three calcium silicate materials showed good biocompatibility and the ability to form a dentin bridge. Micro-CT quantifications of material voids demonstrated superior seals with bioceramic putty and Theracal-LC groups as compared to Biodentine.

ConclusionsReady-to-use, premixed capping agents exhibit better sealing ability in mice, while promoting dentin bridge formation to protect the dental pulp."
"As the serial section community transitions to volume electron microscopy, tools are needed to balance rapid segmentation efforts with documenting the fine detail of structures that support cell function. New annotation applications should be accessible to users and meet the needs of the neuroscience and connectomics communities while also being useful across other disciplines. Issues not currently addressed by a single, modern annotation application include: 1) built-in curation systems with utilities for expert intervention to provide quality assurance, 2) integrated alignment features that allow for image registration on-the-fly as image flaws are discovered during annotation, 3) simplicity for non-specialists within and beyond the neuroscience community, 5) a system to store experimental meta-data with annotation data in a way that researchers remain masked regarding condition to avoid potential biases, 6) local management of large datasets, 7) fully open-source codebase allowing development of new tools, and more. Here, we present PyReconstruct, a modern successor to the Reconstruct annotation tool. PyReconstruct operates in a field-agnostic manner, runs on all major operating systems, breaks through legacy RAM limitations, features an intuitive and collaborative curation system, and employs a flexible and dynamic approach to image registration. It can be used to analyze, display, and publish experimental or connectomics data. PyReconstruct is suited for generating ground truth to implement in automated segmentation, outcomes of which can be returned to PyReconstruct for proofreading and quality control.

Significance statementIn neuroscience, the emerging field of connectomics has produced annotation tools for reconstruction that prioritize circuit connectivity across microns to centimeters and farther. Determining the strength of synapses forming the connections is crucial to understand function and requires quantification of their nanoscale dimensions and subcellular composition. PyReconstruct, successor to the early annotation tool Reconstruct, meets these requirements for synapses and other structures well beyond neuroscience. PyReconstruct lifts many restrictions of legacy Reconstruct and offers a user-friendly interface, integrated curation, dynamic alignment, nanoscale quantification, 3D visualization, and more. Extensive compatibility with third-party software provides access to the expanding tools from the connectomics and imaging communities."
"Detecting signatures of positive selection in protein-coding genes is fundamental to understanding adaptive evolution. However, conventional workflows using codeml (PAML) require extensive manual configuration (e.g. editing control files) and are limited by sequential execution, which is impractical for large-scale analyses. To address these challenges, BABAPPA (Bash-Based Automated Parallel Positive Selection Analysis), a fully automated pipeline has been developed that streamlines every step of codeml analysis. BABAPPA integrates codon-aware sequence filtering, alignment, phylogenetic reconstruction, branch designation, model fitting, likelihood-ratio testing, and multiple-testing correction into a single reproducible workflow. The BABAPPA has been benchmarked on three Brassicaceae orthologous gene sets and found that it produces identical positive-selection results (after FDR correction) to a standard codeml approach, while dramatically reducing computation time. Mean wall-clock time dropped from 2,579 s (standard workflow) to 1,430 s with BABAPPA, a 44.6% reduction in runtime which is equivalent to an 80.3% speedup (p = 8.227e-5). These gains are achieved without loss of sensitivity. The robust automation and efficiency of BABAPPA make it well-suited for large-scale genomic surveys of adaptive evolution."
"Cyclic peptides with backbone N-methylated amino acids(BNMeAAs) and D-amino acids(D-AAs) have gained attention for their stability, membrane permeability, and other therapeutic potentials. Currently, Rosetta can predict their structures using energy calculations, but this method is heavily time-consuming. Moreover, structural data for cyclic peptides containing BNMeAAs and D-AAs are extremely insufficient to build a data-driven structure prediction model. To address these problems, we propose MeDCycFold, a deep learning-based Rosetta distillation model by fine-tuning the AlphaFold model. First, a cyclic peptide structure dataset is constructed using Rosetta by sampling massive conformations for cyclic peptides with BNMeAAs and D-AAs and evaluating their energy scores. Then, the AlphaFold model is fine-tuned with the extended 56 BNMeAAs and D-AAs. Besides, a relative position cyclic matrix is introduced for head-to-tail cyclization in the cyclic peptides. Finally, a force field is employed to reduce clashes in the predicted structures. Empirical experiments show that our proposed MeDCycFold speeds up structure prediction by 49 times while maintaining the prediction accuracy comparable to Rosetta, which can greatly accelerate the development of cyclic peptide drugs."
"Host cells produce a vast network of antiviral factors in response to viral infection. The interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are important effectors of a broad-spectrum antiviral response. In contrast to their canonical roles, we previously identified IFIT2 and IFIT3 as pro-viral host factors during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. During IAV infection, IFIT2 binds and enhances translation of AU-rich cellular mRNAs, including many IFN-simulated gene products, establishing a model for its broad antiviral activity. But, IFIT2 also bound viral mRNAs and enhanced their translation resulting in increased viral replication. The ability of IFIT3 to bind RNA and whether this is important for its function was not known. Here we validate direct interactions between IFIT3 and RNA using electromobility shift assays (EMSAs). RNA-binding site identification (RBS-ID) experiments then identified an RNA-binding surface composed of residues conserved in IFIT3 orthologs and IFIT2 paralogs. Mutation of the RNA-binding site reduced the ability IFIT3 to promote IAV gene expression and translation efficiency when compared to wild type IFIT3. The functional units of IFIT2 and IFIT3 are homo- and heterodimers, however the RNA-binding surfaces are located near the dimerization interface. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we showed that mutations to these sites do not affect dimerization. Together, these data establish the link between IFIT3 RNA-binding and its ability to modulate translation of host and viral mRNAs during IAV infection.

ImportanceInfluenza A viruses (IAV) cause considerable morbidity and mortality through sporadic pandemics as well as annual epidemics. Zoonotic IAV strains pose an additional risk of spillover into a naive human population where prior immunity can have minimal effect. In this case, the first line of defense in the host is the innate immune response. Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) produce a suite of proteins that are front-line effectors of innate immune responses. While ISGs are typically considered antiviral, new work has revealed an emerging trend where viruses co-opt ISGs for pro-viral function. Here, we determine how the ISG IFIT3 is used by IAV as a pro-viral factor, advancing our understanding of IFIT3 function generally as well as specifically in the context of IAV infection."
"BackgroundActin filament organization in cardiomyocytes critically depends on the formin Fhod3, but no role has been previously described for Fhod3 in skeletal muscle development.

ResultsWe demonstrate here that in zebrafish mutated for one of two fhod3 paralog genes, fhod3a, skeletal muscle of the trunk appears normal through 2 days post-fertilization, but afterward exhibits myofibril damage, including gaps between myofibrils and myofibril fragmentation. Although myofibril damage appears progressive, fhod3a mutant embryos differ from muscular dystrophy models in that damage is not activity-dependent, but is exacerbated by inhibition of muscle activity. Moreover, fhod3a mutants show no evidence of sarcolemma disruption. Rather, our results suggest myofibril damage coincides with growth of the skeletal muscle fiber contractile apparatus. Neither the second paralog, fhod3b, nor the more distantly related fhod1 appear to contribute to embryonic skeletal muscle development, but simultaneous mutation of fhod3a and fhod3b was associated with pericardial edema suggestive of cardiac dysfunction.

ConclusionsTaken together, these results indicate a fhod3 homolog is dispensable for initial myofibril assembly in skeletal muscle, but promotes myofibril stability during muscle fiber growth. This is the first demonstration that Fhod3 contributes to skeletal muscle development in a vertebrate."
"Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is characterized by an aggressive clinical course, high genomic instability, and limited therapeutic options. The Inhibitor of Differentiation 4 (ID4) protein has been identified as a critical regulator of BLBC, where its overexpression correlates with poor prognosis. However, the mechanistic contributions of ID4 to BLBC tumorigenesis remain incompletely understood. In this study, we employed an integrative approach combining CRISPR-Cas9-mediated ID4 knockout, small-molecule inhibition, in vivo tumor modeling, and in silico transcriptional analyses to investigate the functional role of ID4 in BLBC.

CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of ID4 in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in significant reductions in proliferation, colony formation, and Ki67 expression, indicating a loss of aggressive phenotypic traits. In vivo xenograft studies further revealed that ID4-silenced cells exhibited markedly delayed tumor formation and a significant reduction in metastatic potential compared to controls. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of basal-like tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset demonstrated that patients with low ID4 expression had improved relapse-free survival.

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of BLBC tumors stratified by ID4 expression revealed a shift toward luminal-like transcriptional programs in the ID4-low subgroup, including increased estrogen response and inflammatory signaling pathways. Furthermore, transcription factor activity analysis identified the activation of MYC, JUN, and STAT in ID4-low tumors, suggesting a transition toward a more differentiated phenotype. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of ID4 using the small-molecule degrader AGX51 effectively reduced proliferation in TNBC cells, highlighting ID4 as a potential therapeutic target.

Together, these findings establish ID4 as a key driver of BLBC aggressiveness and suggest that its inhibition may represent a viable therapeutic strategy. This study provides compelling evidence supporting the development of ID4-targeted therapies for TNBC patients, with the potential to improve clinical outcomes in this challenging disease subset."
"Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most prevalent primary liver cancer and arises from hepatocytes, which are very metabolically active and contain abundant mitochondria. Despite extensive characterisation of nuclear driver genes and pathways, the role of crosstalk between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in mitochondrial mutagenesis remains poorly understood. To address this, we leveraged a chemical carcinogenesis model of liver cancer in four mouse strains. We analysed hundreds of tumours with paired whole-genome sequencing and total RNA sequencing to comprehensively characterise mitochondrial mutations and expression. Following de novo assembly of strain-specific mitochondrial genomes, we devised an accurate and efficient heteroplasmy detection approach and analysed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and transcription. Across strains, there was high concordance of the number of heteroplasmies, mutation signatures, and variant allele frequencies. In contrast, the heteroplasmy rate and genic locations differed between strains, suggesting strain-specificity in DNA repair mechanisms in early tumour development. Independent of age or environmental factors, tumours had lower mtDNA content than adjacent normal liver, suggesting mitochondrial loss during tumourigenesis. Additionally, within individual strains, mtDNA content differences were associated with nuclear driver gene choice. Our comprehensive characterisation of mitochondrial genomes and expression patterns demonstrates that both germline and somatic genetic variation influence tumour mtDNA content, mutation patterns, and gene expression."
"AbstractMice are slowly being accepted as alternative models for investigation of leptospiral infection. The strain most used to analyse sublethal disease (C3H-HeJ) expresses a tlr4 gene in its immune cells that is hyporesponsive to leptospiral LPS and thus the model is deemed immunocompromised. To help resolve this valid scientific concern we did a study in which we compared infection with Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni Fiocruz in mice expressing fully competent tlr4 (C3H-HeN, C57BL6) versus tlr4 hyporesponsive mice (C3H- HeJ) over a period of two weeks. We found that the C3H-HeJ mouse was the only strain that sustained lethal infection, thus confirming the association between tlr4 function and acute disease. We found that the two mouse strains with a fully functional tlr4 gene (C3H-HeN and C57BL/6) also developed clinical and molecular signs of sublethal leptospirosis nearly on par with C3H-HeJ, as quantified by weight loss, survival curves, presence of Leptospira 16S rRNA in blood and urine, and burden of viable spirochetes in kidney. Regarding kidney markers of inflammation and fibrosis, C3H-HeN and C57BL/6 produced less IL-1 beta, iNOS and ColA1 than C3H-HeJ, which is consistent with increased resilience to infection expected of the tlr4 competent strains. Regarding Leptospira-specific antibody, all mouse strains produced IgM and T-cell independent IgG3. Interestingly, in contrast to C57BL/6, both C3H strains produced circulating IgG1 but only C3H-HeN produced IgG2a to L. interrogans two weeks post infection. Thus, TLR4-competent C3H-HeN and C57BL/6 may be more appropriate mouse models of sublethal leptospirosis, whereas C3H-HeJ can be used to further establish a mouse model of lethal leptospirosis. Our data strongly suggests that TLR4 function is important but not sufficient to cause susceptibility to leptospirosis.

Author summaryPrevious studies by different laboratories have shown C3H-HeJ to be a susceptible mouse strain to sublethal and lethal leptospirosis. The goal of our study was to evaluate if low tlr4 responsiveness to leptospiral LPS in C3H-HeJ mice is the factor that drives susceptibility to infection with pathogenic Leptospira. We did a comparative study using mouse strains immunocompetent and hyporesponsive to tlr4. The data shows that although tlr4 does affect the virulence of leptospirosis (only C3H-HeJ succumbed to infection), the tlr4 competent strains (C3H-HeN and C57BL/6) also developed measurable sublethal leptospirosis. Thus, competent recognition of leptospiral-LPS by murine TLR4 plays a role but it is not sufficient to determine susceptibility to leptospirosis. Furthermore, the data suggests that T-cell dependent responses could be involved in susceptibility to leptospirosis in the C3H models of infection."
"Conjugative DNA transfer is a major driver of microbial evolution and an essential tool for biotechnological applications. While conjugation between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria has been observed, its efficiency and underlying principles remain poorly understood. This systematic review and meta-analysis assess the success and influencing factors of Escherichia coli-to-Gram-positive conjugation. A systematic search of the PubMed database (up to December 2024) identified 31 studies reporting E. coli-to-Gram-positive conjugation, comprising 512 measurements. Studies were included based on experimental evidence of conjugative transfer and reported efficiency values. Data extraction was performed manually, and statistical analyses were conducted to identify key trends. We found that E. coli-to-Gram-positive conjugation is significantly less efficient than E. coli-to-E. coli or E. coli-to-other Gram-negative bacteria. However, certain recipient strains and optimized conditions enable surprisingly high efficiencies, within 1-2 orders of magnitude of E. coli-to-E. coli conjugation. Strategies that improve efficiency include altering plasmid methylation patterns, optimizing cation concentrations, and modifying donor-recipient ratios. Limitations include potential bias toward well-studied bacterial groups (e.g., Streptomycetaceae), variability in experimental conditions, and incomplete reporting in some studies. Further research should explore additional recipient strains, refine conjugation mechanisms, and optimize transfer conditions to enhance DNA delivery to non-model microbes. Understanding these processes may pave the way for more efficient and universal DNA transfer methods across diverse microbial taxa."
"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AMD have identified dozens of risk loci that may house disease targets. However, variants at these loci are largely noncoding, making it difficult to assess their function and whether they are causal. Here, we present a single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility atlas of human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid to systematically analyze both coding and noncoding variants implicated in AMD. We employ HiChIP and Activity-by-Contact modeling to map enhancers in these tissues and predict cell and gene targets of risk variants. We further perform allele-specific self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) to functionally test variant activity in RPE cells, including in the context of complement activation. Our work nominates new pathogenic variants and mechanisms in AMD and offers a rich and accessible resource for studying diseases of the RPE and choroid."
"Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) is a rapid, sensitive, and isothermal method for nucleic acid amplification that has gained widespread use in diagnostic applications. While well-suited for single-target assays, extending RPA to multiplex detection remains technically challenging despite the multiplexed RPA being essential for tasks such as differential diagnosis and inclusion of internal controls. Existing multiplex RPA strategies rely on proprietary probes (e.g., Exo, Fpg, Nfo), which require complex design, are susceptible to cross-reactivity, and often depend on sophisticated optical instrumentation, limiting their scalability. To address these limitations, here, we developed a probe-free multiplex RPA assay that distinguishes targets by amplicon length, using solid-state nanopore detection of single molecules and deep neural network (DNN)-based classification. Using the Monkeypox (Mpox) as a model, we designed and validated a multiplex RPA assay targeting both the Mpox gene and the human RNase P gene as an internal control. We systematically evaluated the nanopore size requirement for detecting DNA amplicons ranging from 50 to 500 base pairs and found that [~]7 nm pores provided optimal performance for amplicons between 75 and 500 bp, balancing high event rates without pore clogging. Using single-molecule translocation events as input, we trained and optimized a DNN to classify amplicons by target. The model achieved 94.2% accuracy at the single-molecule event level, which translated to 100% accuracy at the population-level target call. While our current system demonstrates duplex detection, the strategy is inherently scalable to higher multiplex levels. These findings establish a new framework for multiplex RPA that eliminates the need for complex probe design and optical detection, paving the way for robust, scalable, and accessible molecular diagnostics."
"Structural studies of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription complexes often depend on in vitro assembly by mixing purified Pol II with synthetic DNA/RNA scaffolds, recombinant transcription factors, and/or histones, followed by stalling transcription at defined positions by adding selected nucleotide triphosphate substrates. These studies have yielded remarkable results for understanding nucleosome transcription by Pol II with elongation factors but may fail to represent transcription in native conditions. To investigate Pol II transcription within metazoan cells, we developed an approach to isolate the native transcription complexes from Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Utilizing one-step FLAG-tag affinity purification and mild chromatin treatment with Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase), we preserved the native transcription complex for cryo-EM and proteomics studies. In silico purification through the cryo-EM classifications determined structures of multiple forms of native transcription complex, nucleosome and other macromolecules. Remarkably, we determined the structures of metazoan Rpb4/Rpb7 stalk-less elongation complex as well as hexameric nucleosome lacking an H2A/H2B dimer, revealing that diverse elongation complexes and nucleosomes are involved in active transcription in vivo. Nucleosome is positioned only downstream of Pol II in the nucleosome elongation complex, underscoring it as a major energy barrier and a time-consuming step during Pol II progression through nucleosomal DNA. Proteomics identified co-purified factors responsible for initiation and elongation stages of transcription, as well as RNA modification factors. This study lays the groundwork for structural study of native transcription in eukaryotes, with future work focused on studies of transient and minor populations of transcription complexes."
"Generative network models (GNMs) have been proposed to identify the mechanisms/constraints that shape the organisation of the connectome. These models parameterise the formation of inter-regional connections using a trade-off between connection cost and topological complexity or biophysical similarity. Despite their simplicity, GNMs can generate synthetic networks that capture many topological properties of empirical brain networks. However, current models often fail to capture the topography (i.e., spatial embedding) of many such properties, such as the anatomical location of network hubs. In this study, we investigate a diverse array of generative network model formulations and find that none can accurately capture empirical patterns of long-range connectivity. We demonstrate that the spatial embedding of longer-range connections is critical in defining hub locations and that it is precisely these connections that are poorly captured by extant models. We further show how standard measures used for model optimisation and evaluation mask these and other differences between synthetic and empirical brain networks, highlighting the need for care when interpreting generative network models and metrics. Overall, our findings demonstrate common failure modes of GNMs, identify why these models do not fully capture brain network organisation, and suggest ways the field can move forward to address these challenges.

Author summaryGenerative network models aim to explain the organisation of connectomes using simple wiring rules. While these models replicate topological features of brain networks, they do not capture key topographical properties, like the anatomical location of network hubs. We show that this failure occurs because the models are unable to accurately capture the spatial position of long-range inter-regional connections. Moreover, standard evaluation measures fail to accurately quantify the similarity between model and empirical networks. This study identifies how and why limitations of current generative models occur and suggests ways forward for improved practices."
"Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is an acute-phase glycoprotein whose up-regulation correlates with blood-brain-barrier breakdown and neuro-inflammatory damage, making it an attractive diagnostic and therapeutic target. Here we present an end-to-end, AI-guided workflow that rapidly generates de-novo miniproteins able to bind LCN2. Backbone scaffolds were generated with RFdiffusion, sequences were optimized with ProteinMPNN, and candidates filtered in silico using a consensus score based on AlphaFold2 confidence scores (mean interface pAE < 10) and interaction free energy calculated by Prodigy before experimental screening. From 10,000 designed sequences, five were expressed and purified from E. coli. Biolayer interferometry (BLI) identified a lead construct, MinP-2, that bound to LCN2 with dissociation constant of Kd = 0.7 nM. Furthermore, structural modeling suggests that binding is primarily mediated by hydrogen bonds between backbone elements. These findings demonstrate that a fully computational generative pipeline can deliver nanomolar LCN2 binders in a single design-build-test cycle. MinP-2 offers a promising starting point for affinity maturation, structural elucidation, and in-vivo evaluation as an imaging probe or antagonist of LCN2-mediated signaling."
"In eukaryotic cells, communication between organelles and the coordination of their activities depend on membrane contact sites (MCS). How MCS are regulated under the dynamic cellular environment remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate how Pex30, a membrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), regulates multiple MCS in budding yeast. We show that Pex30 is critical for the integrity of ER MCS with peroxisomes and vacuoles. This requires the Dysferlin domain (DysF) on Pex30 cytosolic tail. This domain binds to phosphatidic acid (PA) both in vitro and in silico, and it is important for normal PA metabolism in vivo . The DysF domain is evolutionarily conserved and may play a general role in PA homeostasis across eukaryotes. We further show that ER-Vacuole MCS requires Pex30 C-terminal Domain of Unknown Function and that its activity is controlled by phosphorylation in response to metabolic cues. These findings provide new insights into the dynamic nature of MCS and their coordination with cellular metabolism."
"KIF5A (Kinesin family member 5A) is a motor protein that functions as a key component of the axonal transport machinery. Variants in KIF5A are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, mainly spastic paraplegia type 10 (SPG10), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These diseases share motor neuron involvement but vary significantly in clinical presentation, severity, and progression. KIF5A variants are mainly categorized into N-terminal variants associated with SPG10/CMT2 and C-terminal variants linked to ALS. This study utilized a novel multiplex NULISA targeted platform to analyze plasma proteome from KIF5A-linked SPG10, ALS patients and compared to healthy controls. Our results revealed distinct proteomic signatures, with significant alterations in proteins related to synaptic function, and inflammation. Notably, neurofilament light polypeptide, a biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, was elevated in KIF5A ALS but not in SPG10 patients. Moreover, these findings can now be taken forward to gain mechanistic understanding of axonopathies linking to N-vs C-terminal KIF5A variants affecting both central and peripheral nervous systems."
"The dynamic integration of the lateralized and specialized capacities of the cerebral hemispheres constitutes a hallmark feature of human brain function. This inter-hemispheric exchange of information critically depends upon the corpus callosum. Classical descriptions of callosal organization outline a topographic gradient, such that specific fibers integrate distinct aspects of brain function. Here we present a challenge to this conventional model. Using neuroimaging data obtained from a new cohort of adult corpus callosotomy patients, we leverage modern network neuroscience techniques to show--for the first time--that full inter-hemispheric integration can be achieved via a small proportion ([~]1 cm) of intact posterior callosal fibers. Only complete callosotomy patients demonstrated the expected dissolution of typical inter-hemispheric network architectures, aligning with disconnection syndromes long-thought to reflect diminished information propagation and communication across the brain. These findings motivate a novel mechanistic understanding of synchronized inter-hemispheric neural activity for large-scale human brain function and behavior."
"BackgroundPlasmodium falciparum and P. vivax are parasites responsible for most malaria cases globally. In areas where these species co-exist, individuals gain protection from P. vivax more rapidly, and important biological differences between species may impact the immune response. CD4 T cells are key drivers of immunity to malaria, both as effector and helper cells, with T-follicular helper (Tfh) having key roles in antibody development. Comparative studies on CD4 T cell responses between these species are limited.

MethodsWe assessed CD4 T cells in adults with either P. falciparum or P. vivax malaria. Activation and proliferation of CD4 T cells were measured ex vivo, and functional capacity determined by intracellular cytokine staining by flow cytometry.

ResultsThe phenotype, activation and proliferation of CD4 T cells and effector CD4 T cell subsets were comparable between species. However, within the peripheral (p)Tfh cell compartment, there was evidence for a skew towards pTfh1 cells in P. falciparum, and pTfh2 cells in P. vivax. Additionally, in P. falciparum, increased IL-10 production was detected, including within IL-21 producing CD4 T cells.

ConclusionWhile activation and function of CD4 T cells in malaria are largely comparable, some species-dependent responses are detected within the pTfh cell compartment that may impact antibody development."
"SF3B1 is a core component of the spliceosome involved in branch point recognition and 3 splice site selection. SF3B1 mutation is common in myelodysplastic syndrome and other blood disorders. The most common mutation in SF3B1 is K700E, a lysine to glutamic acid change within the pre-mRNA interacting heat repeat domain. A hallmark of SF3B1 mutation is an increased use of cryptic 3 splice sites; however, the properties distinguishing SF3B1-sensitive splice junctions from other alternatively spliced junctions are unknown. We identify a subset of 192 core splice junctions that are mis-spliced with SF3B1 K700E mutation. We use our core set to test whether SF3B1-sensitive splice sites are different from control cryptic 3 splice sites via RNA structural accessibility. As a comparison, we define a set of SF3B1-resistant splice junctions with cryptic splice site use that does not change with SF3B1 K700E mutation. We find sequence differences between SF3B1-sensitive and SF3B1-resistant junctions, particularly at the cryptic sites. SF3B1-sensitive cryptic 3 splice sites are within an extended polypyrimidine tract and have lower splice site strength scores. We develop experimental RNA structure data for 83 SF3B1-sensitive junctions and 39 SF3B1-resistant junctions. We find that the pattern of structural accessibility at the NAG splicing motif in cryptic and canonical 3 splice sites is similar. In addition, this pattern can be found in both SF3B1-resistant and SF3B1-sensitive junctions. However, SF3B1-sensitive junctions have cryptic splice sites that are less structurally distinct from the canonical splice sites. In addition, SF3B1-sensitive splice junctions are overall more flexible than SF3B1-resistant junctions. Our results suggest that the SF3B1-sensitive splice junctions have unique structure and sequence properties, containing poorly differentiated, weak splice sites that lead to altered 3 splice site recognition in the presence of SF3B1 mutation."
"The maintenance of genetic variation by balancing selection is of considerable interest to evolutionary biologists. An important but understudied potential driver of balancing selection is antagonistic pleiotropy between diploid and haploid stages of the plant life cycle. Despite sharing a common genome, sporophytes (2n) and gametophytes (n) may undergo differential or even opposing selection. Theoretical work suggests the antagonistic pleiotropy between life stages can generate balancing selection and maintain genetic variation. Despite the potential for far-reaching consequences of gametophytic selection, empirical tests of its pleiotropic effects (neutral, synergistic, or antagonistic) on sporophytes are generally lacking. Here, we examined the population genomic signals of selection across life stages in the angiosperm Rumex hastatulus and the moss Ceratodon purpureus. We compared gene expression among life stages and between sexes, combined with neutral diversity statistics and the analysis of the distribution of fitness effects. In contrast to what would be predicted under balancing selection due to antagonistic pleiotropy, we found that unbiased genes between life stages were under stronger purifying selection, likely explained by a predominance of synergistic pleiotropy between life stages and strong purifying selection on broadly expressed genes. In addition, we found that 30% of candidate genes under balancing selection in R. hastatulus were located within inversion polymorphisms. Our findings provide novel insights into the genome-wide characteristics and consequences of plant gametophytic selection.

SignificanceThe genome-wide importance of balancing selection has been a key question in evolutionary biology. Despite theoretical support for the potential of balancing selection generated by antagonistic pleiotropy between plant life stages, to our knowledge no empirical studies have systematically investigated this on a genome-wide scale. Our results revealed genome-wide patterns more consistent with synergistic pleiotropy, with gametophyte-biased genes more likely to be under relaxed purifying selection in both the angiosperm and moss species we investigated. In addition, our study suggests gene expression level and breadth has a greater effect on selection efficacy than differences between ploidy levels in different life stages."
"Psychedelics are well known for their ability to produce profoundly altered states of consciousness. But, more importantly, the effects of psychedelics can influence neurobehavioral changes that last well after these acute subjective effects end. This phenomenon is currently being leveraged in the development of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies for the treatment of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which single doses of psychedelics are able to mediate long-term cognitive changes are an active area of research. We hypothesize that psychedelics contribute to long term changes in cellular state by covalently modifying proteins. This post-translational modification by psychedelics is possible through the transglutaminase-mediated transamidation of their amine termini to glutamine carboxamide residues. Here, we synthesize and utilize a propargylated analogue of mescaline - the classic serotonergic psychedelic phenethylamine found in cacti species - to identify putative protein targets of psychedelic modifications through the use of click-chemistry in a primary human astrocyte cell culture model. Our preliminary findings indicate that a diverse array of glial proteins may be substrates for transglutaminase 2-mediated monoaminylation by our model phenethylamine (""phenethylaminylation""). Based on these points, we speculatively highlight new directions for the study of this putative noncanonical psychedelic activity."
"Epileptic seizures are often influenced by time-of-day and changes in vigilance state, yet the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning these associations remain poorly understood. Astrocytes, a pivotal type of glial cell, play a critical role in modulating neuronal excitability and circadian rhythms, and they express Fatty Acid Binding Protein 7 (Fabp7), a molecule vital for sleep regulation, lipid signaling, and gene transcription. This study investigates the role of Fabp7 in determining time-of-day dependent seizure susceptibility. We assessed electroshock seizure thresholds in male C57/BL6N wild-type (WT) and Fabp7 knockout (KO) mice. Results demonstrated that, compared to WT mice, Fabp7 KO mice displayed significantly elevated general and maximal electroshock seizure thresholds (GEST and MEST) during the dark phase, but not during the light phase. To explore the impact of Fabp7 on activity-dependent gene expression during seizures, we conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on cortical and hippocampal tissues from WT and Fabp7 KO mice following MEST and SHAM procedures during the dark period. While immediate early genes (IEGs) showed considerable differential expression between WT-MEST and WT-SHAM, this expression was absent in Fabp7 KO-MEST compared to Fabp7 KO-SHAM. Gene ontology analyses revealed significant overlaps between the WT-MEST:WT-SHAM and Fabp7 KO-SHAM:WT-SHAM comparisons, indicating that the basal mRNA expression profiles in Fabp7 KO brains resemble those of WT brains in a post-ictal state. Collectively, these findings suggest that Fabp7 is a key regulator of time-of-day dependent neural excitability and that astrocyte-mediated signaling pathways involving Fabp7 interact with neuronal activity to influence gene expression in response to seizures.

Significance StatementChanges in sleep/wake state and/or circadian time-of-day are thought to influence neural excitability, which may confer seizure susceptibility. Here we describe a role for astrocytic Fabp7 in regulating nocturnal seizure threshold and gene expression associated with differences in seizure susceptibility, introducing an astrocyte factor that may represent a novel antiepileptic target for drug development."
"Cytochrome c (Cyt-c), encoded by the CYCS gene, is crucial for electron transport, peroxidase activity, and apoptosis. Mutations in CYCS causes thrombocytopenia 4, a disorder with low platelet counts. We have, for instance, recently described six Italian families with five different heterozygous missense CYCS variants. These mutations likely enhance peroxidase and apoptotic activities, yet the mechanisms causing reduced platelet production and increased apoptosis are unclear. This study investigates clinically-related Cyt-c variants using an integrated bioinformatics approach. Our findings reveal that all variants are at evolutionarily conserved sites, potentially disrupting Cyt-c function and contributing to disease phenotypes. Specific variants are predicted to affect phosphorylation (T20I, V21G, Y49H), and ubiquitination (G42S, A52T, A52V, T103I). Molecular dynamics simulations (500 ns) revealed significant structural differences from the wild-type protein, with mutants showing reduced stability and increased unfolding and flexibility, particularly in the {Omega}-loops. These changes result in the displacement of the {Omega}-loops away from the heme iron, weakening critical hydrogen bonds and consequently opening the heme active site. This open conformation may enhance accessibility to small molecules such as H2O2, thereby promoting peroxidase activity, which may enhance apoptosis and likely impact megakaryopoiesis and platelet homeostasis in THC4."
"In vitro hematopoiesis systems can be used to define mechanisms for blood cell formation and function, produce cell therapeutics, and model blood cell contributions to systemic disease.

Hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) production remains inefficient, precluded by knowledge gaps related to specification and morphogenesis of specialized hemogenic endothelial cells, which undergo an endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) to form HPCs. We elected to define changes in gene expression and chromatin organization during HPC formation to reveal regulatory mechanisms. Using paired single cell RNA/ATAC sequencing together with Hi-C, we profiled cells before and after EHT. Pathway analysis and pseudotime inferences confirmed a continuum of stromal and endothelial cells undergoing development into HE cells and lineage-based HPCs in vitro. In these cell types, we characterize cis-regulatory elements and transcriptional regulatory activities that facilitate EHT and HPC homeostasis, including for SNAI1, SOX17, TGF{beta}, STAT4, as well as for GFI1b and KLF1 in megakaryocyte- and erythroid-biased progenitors, respectively. We then leveraged our insights into chromatin organization among in vitro-derived cells to assess enrichments corresponding to human trait variation reported in human genome wide association studies. HPCs revealed locus enrichment for quantitative blood traits and autoimmune disease predisposition, which were particularly enriched in myeloid- and lymphoid-biased populations. Stromal and endothelial cells from our in vitro cultures were specifically enriched for accessible chromatin at blood pressure loci. Our findings reveal genes and mechanisms governing in vitro hematopoietic development and blood cell-related disease pathology."
"Domestic ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are important for modeling human respiratory diseases. However, ferret B and T cell receptors have not been completely identified or annotated, limiting immune repertoire studies. Here we performed long read transcriptome sequencing of ferret splenocyte and lymph node samples to obtain over 120,000 high-quality full-length immunoglobin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) transcripts. We constructed a complete reference set of the constant regions of ferret Ig and TCR isotypes and chain types. We also systematically annotated germline Ig and TCR variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J), and constant (C) genes on a recent ferret reference genome assembly. We designed new ferret-specific immune repertoire profiling assays by targeting positions in constant regions without allelic diversity across 11 ferret genome assemblies, and experimentally validated them using a commercially compatible single-cell-based platform. These improved resources and assays will enable future studies to fully capture ferret immune repertoire diversity."
"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis. During ageing, the BBB undergoes structural alterations. Electron microscopy (EM) is the gold standard for studying the structural alterations of the brain vasculature. However, analysis of EM images is time-intensive and can be prone to selection bias, limiting our understanding of the structural effect of ageing on the BBB. Here, we introduce 3BTRON, a deep learning framework for the automated analysis of electron microscopy images of the BBB. Using age as a readout, we trained and validated our model on a unique dataset (n = 359). We show that the proposed model could confidently identify the BBB of aged mouse brains from young mouse brains across three different brain regions, achieving a sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 80.0% post-stratification when predicting on unseen data. Additionally, feature importance methods revealed the spatial features of each image that contributed most to the predictions. These findings demonstrate a new data-driven approach to analysing age-related changes in the architecture of the BBB."
"BackgroundThe human gut microbiome is a natural source of essential micronutrients like B-vitamins, which are utilized by both the host and other community members. The distribution of prevalence and abundance of known B-vitamin producers in Indian cohorts was reported to be marginally higher than that of the entire gut microbiome.

ObjectiveTo test whether the presence of B-vitamin producers/biosynthetic pathways translates into serum B-vitamin levels, taking B12 as a case example.

MethodsFecal samples were collected from non-deficient (n=29) and B12 deficient (n=30) children from a tribal region of central India. Whole metagenomic DNA was extracted, sequenced, and analyzed for taxonomic profiling and diversity comparisons. Differentially abundant taxa between two groups were identified. The prevalence and abundance of potential B12 producers were compared, and their association with serum B12 level was established.

ResultsA comparison of within-sample diversity between the two groups didnt show any difference; however, between-sample diversity was significantly less in the B12 deficient group. Differential abundance testing also reflected changes in microbiome structure upon B12 deficiency, where an increased abundance of B12 transporter-carrying Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a few pathogenic species, and ten known B12 producers was observed in the deficient group. Potential B12 producers were also significantly prevalent and abundant in the deficient group. Their cumulative abundance was also significantly higher in the deficient group and showed a negative association with serum B12 levels.

ConclusionB12 absorption in the colon supports the idea that gut microbes contribute to its supply. Higher potential B12 producers in the deficient group suggest an adaptive mechanism by the gut microbiome to meet the communitys B12 requirements. Even at low bioavailability, the gut microbiome appears to selectively promote the growth of B12 producers either due to selective pressure or due to the hosts efforts to maintain B12 homeostasis, indicating host-microbiome feedback regulation."
"Although chiral monoterpenes emitted by plants above- and belowground shape the chemical landscape of many ecosystems, their biosynthesis and emissions, especially in response to drought, are poorly understood. We imposed a 6-week drought on two-year old, potted saplings of Norway spruce and analysed chiral monoterpene emissions and tissue concentrations from needles and roots. Isotopically labelled pyruvate was used to compare tissue-specific contributions of de novo synthesis to chiral monoterpene concentrations. While de novo synthesis of (-)--pinene and both enantiomers of limonene was apparent in needle emissions, no label was incorporated in roots. Drought reduced chiral monoterpene emissions to 30% of control levels, but increased needle and root tissue concentrations by 150 and 230%, respectively. Aboveground monoterpene concentrations were dominated by (-)-limonene, whereas belowground concentrations mainly consisted of the (-)-enantiomers of -pinene, {beta}-pinene, {beta}-phellandrene and camphene. Chiral composition in needles shifted in response to drought but remained stable in roots. We conclude that chiral monoterpene composition is tissue-specific and likely related to tissue-specific functioning. Instead of being passively emitted from storage pools, our results suggest active control mechanisms regulating chiral monoterpene emissions under drought conditions. Our findings imply important ramifications for understanding the regulation of emissions in relation to storage pools and plant-environmental interactions.

Summary StatementEmissions of chiral monoterpenes and their composition is tissue-specific and regulated independent from storage pools in Picea abies. Chiral monoterpene ratios shift aboveground in response to drought, but are not affected belowground."
"BackgroundEnhancer RNAs (eRNAs) have been shown to modulate the transcriptional landscape of prostate cancer (PCa). The Androgen Receptor (AR), a well-known modulator of eRNA expression, contains an RNA-binding region that interacts with RNA molecules in a sequence-specific manner. However, there is currently no evidence that AR forms complexes with eRNAs to regulate gene expression.

MethodsTo explore the eRNA-AR interactome, we reanalyzed publicly available RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and AR-RIP-seq data from prostate cancer cell lines to identify a single long non-coding eRNA that interacts with AR (ARA-elncRNA1). Using linear regression, we identified genomic regions where AR occupancy is associated with the expression level of ARA-elncRNA1. We further demonstrated that this eRNA recruits AR to YY1-mediated enhancer-promoter loops, stabilizing these interactions. A series of experiments, including RIP-qPCR, ChIP-qPCR, and EMSA, were conducted to validate the proposed model. Finally, we investigated the role of ARA-elncRNA1 in prostate cancer cells survival.

ResultsWe confirmed the sequence-specific interaction between AR and ARA-elncRNA1. This eRNA not only regulates AR occupancy at the promoters of several AR-dependent genes but also protects AR from proteasomal degradation. The AR:ARA-elncRNA1 complex interacts with YY1 and influences enhancer-promoter looping. Additionally, ARA-elncRNA1 was found to inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer (PCa) cells in vitro and expression level of lncRNA was associated with a lower Gleason score.

ConclusionsOur findings revealed the existence of an eRNA that directly binds to AR and regulates, in trans, the expression of several AR-dependent genes. We demonstrated that eRNAs can not only interact with AR but also modulate chromatin structure. These insights shed new light on the functional roles of eRNAs and their contribution to cancer development."
"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a critical global health challenge, with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causing 10.8 million cases and 1.25 million deaths in 2023. Key issues include the dormant state of Mtb, resistant to drugs and immune responses, and the emergence of multi-drug-resistant strains. This underscores the need for new therapeutic targets and deeper research into Mtb pathogenesis and immunology.

A potential drug target is the enzyme thiosulfate-sulfurtransferase SseA, which plays a role in macrophage infection by Mtb and its resistance to oxidative stress. SseA belongs to the rhodanese-like enzyme family, which catalyzes sulfur transfer reactions essential for Mtb survival.

In our research, we identified a new protein (Rv3284), hereinafter referred to as SufEMtb due to its high homology with E. coli SufE, that interacts with SseA and modulates its activity. Sequence analysis and AI molecular modelling revealed detailed insights into their interaction that can contribute to the modulation of SseA activity. This research provides a mechanistic explanation to the need of a partner for SseA activation. Indeed, we propose that SufEMtb enhances SseA enzymatic function by binding to its non-catalytic N-terminal domain and bringing the active sites of the two proteins in close proximity, thus preparing for the activation-enhancing conformational change in a regulatory loop of SseA. This interaction is crucial for the effective enzyme activity and the maintenance of redox homeostasis in Mtb, making the SseA-SufEMtb protein complex a potential target for new TB therapies."
"Porous materials, such as biological tissue, often have heterogeneous microstructures where imbibed fluid experiences distinct environments on short timescales, but can exchange among different environments over long timescales. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods such as diffusion exchange spectroscopy (DEXSY) can measure this exchange in water under steady-state and equilibrium conditions; however, modeling becomes more complex when more than two exchanging environments are involved. This complexity is particularly relevant in the central nervous system (CNS), where water diffusion and exchange at the cellular level play critical roles in homeostasis. While DEXSY can measure these processes, they may not be adequately modeled as two-site exchange between intracellular and extracellular spaces (ICS and ECS). Here we study the behavior of apparent exchange rate constants (AXR) estimated from DEXSY data numerically simulated using a three-site exchange model (3XM). The 3XM is based on gray matter microstructural characteristics, incorporating both transmembrane exchange between ECS and ICS and geometric exchange between environments within ICS where water mobility differs due to the complex architecture of neurons, glial cells, and the ECS. Inspired by the Na+/K+-ATPase pump-leak model of cell volume maintenance, the 3XM accounts for effects of osmolytes, ions, and voltage on ECS and ICS volume fraction. The model predicts a significant reduction in AXR and a smaller decrease in apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) following the level of membrane depolarization expected from Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition. These changes were reversed by the addition of membrane-impermeable ECS osmolytes, independent of voltage, in agreement with previous experiments. While the exchange rate constants for each pathway simply follow first-order kinetics, the AXRs sensitivity to these pathways depend on the ECS volume fraction. When ECS is present, transmembrane exchange dominates, but when cells swell following pump inhibition, geometric exchange becomes the dominant pathway."
"PurposeTo evaluate the immunomodulatory effects on experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist Laquinimod (LAQ), and its active metabolite DELAQ, with a focus on dendritic cell- and T cell-mediated mechanisms.

MethodsEAU was induced in mice by active immunization or by adoptive transfer of activated T cells. Mice were treated with LAQ either from the time of immunization or from 7 days after. Effects of LAQ were examined in wild-type, global AhR-knockout, or dendritic cell-conditional AhR knockout mice. Direct vs. indirect effects of AhR agonism on dendritic cells and T cells were studied in vitro using DELAQ, a major active metabolite of LAQ.

ResultsLAQ treatment from Day 0 fully suppressed EAU, while delayed treatment (Day 7) provided only partial protection. In the adoptive transfer model, LAQ-treated recipients showed reduced pathology. Global AhR-deficient mice developed severe EAU comparable to that of wild-type mice, with an elevated Th17 response. LAQ-treated mice displayed increased frequencies of cDC1 and FoxP3 regulatory T cells. In vitro, DELAQ activated AhR signaling and induced Ido1 and Ido2 expression in dendritic cells. DELAQ inhibited the activation of naive and memory mouse T cells in an APC-dependent manner, as the response to anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation was unaffected. Importantly, DELAQ suppressed recall responses of human PBMC to tetanus toxoid.

ConclusionsLAQ protects against EAU by acting on AhR-expressing antigen-presenting cells to impair both priming and reactivation of pathogenic T cells. Its active metabolite DELAQ does not suppress T cells directly, but re-programs dendritic cells toward a tolerogenic, IDO-expressing phenotype that promotes immune regulation."
"MotivationOxford Nanopore Technologies devices, such as MinION, permit affordable, real-time DNA sequencing, and come with targeted sequencing capabilities. Such capabilities create new challenges for metagenomic classifiers that must be computationally efficient yet robust enough to handle potentially erroneous DNA reads, while ideally inspecting only a few hundred bases of a read. Currently available DNA classifiers leave room for improvement with respect to classification accuracy, memory usage, and the ability to operate in targeted sequencing scenarios.

ResultsWe present SKiM: Short K-mers in Metagenomics, a new lightweight metagenomic classifier designed for ONT reads. Compared to state-of-the-art classifiers, SKiM requires only a fraction of memory to run, and can classify DNA reads with higher accuracy after inspecting only their first few hundred bases. To achieve this, SKiM introduces new data compression techniques to maintain a reference database built from short k-mers, and treats classification as a statistical testing problem.

AvailabilitySKiM source code, documentation and test data are available from: https://gitlab.com/SCoRe-Group/skim.

"Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) is the common way to gather information about human brain function across the existing literature in order to formulate hypotheses and contextualize new findings. However, automated CBMA tools face challenges such as inconsistent terminology and difficulties in analyzing long texts and capturing semantic meaning because they still rely on bag-of-words approaches; furthermore, sparse coordinate reporting in CBMA distorts the activation distribution due to incomplete data. This paper introduces NeuroConText, an automated CBMA tool that bridges neuroscience text, brain location coordinates and brain images by creating a shared latent space for encoding text and brain maps. This relies on a multi-objective loss combining contrastive and reconstruction terms. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to capture neuroscientific information from full-text articles, plus an LLM-based text augmentation strategy to handle short-text inputs. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate NeuroConTexts ability to enhance text-to-brain retrieval performance and reconstruct brain maps from neuroscience texts. We also show that CBMA tools can infer brain activations in regions discussed in articles but absent in reported coordinates, potentially addressing the challenge of sparse coordinate reporting.

Author summaryNeuroscience studies often suffer from limited sample sizes, resulting in findings with low statistical power and uncertain reproducibility. Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) addresses this problem by pooling results across studies to identify consistent associations between cognitive processes and brain regions. This article introduces NeuroConText, an automated CBMA tool designed to integrate heterogeneous data sources, including brain images, full-text articles, and reported coordinate tables. NeuroConText uses large language models (LLMs) to capture rich semantic information from full-text of neuroscience articles to link neuroscience text to brain images and coordinates. The goal of NeuroConText is to retrieve brain locations or brain maps associated with text-based descriptions and to reconstruct brain activation patterns from text. NeuroConText is also designed to support short input queries, which makes it applicable to a wider range of use cases. In addition, we show that meta-analysis tools can highlight regions not explicitly reported in coordinate tables, thus overcoming the limitations posed by sparsely reported coordinates in neuroscience articles. In summary, by improving associations between neuroscience texts and brain locations, NeuroConText enhances the capabilities of coordinate-based meta-analysis."
"Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue fever and exerts a substantial healthcare burden worldwide. Like other flaviviruses, DENV must undergo membrane fusion with the host cell in order to initiate infection. This membrane fusion occurs following acidification during endocytosis and is pH dependent. Here, we interrogate whether the mechanism of DENV fusion contains an off-pathway state, such has been reported previously for two other flaviviruses - Zika virus and West Nile virus. To do this, we utilize single particle lipid mixing measurements of DENV virus-like particles (VLPs) to tethered liposomes, together with computational modeling inspired by chemical kinetics. By observing and then modeling the pH dependence of single VLP fusion kinetics, we provide evidence that the DENV fusion mechanism must contain an off-pathway state. Measuring the proportion of VLPs undergoing hemi-fusion over time, we also demonstrate that the off-pathway state appears to be slowly reversible over tens of minutes, at least for some virions. Additionally, we find that late endosomal anionic lipids do not appear to influence the off-pathway mechanism to any great extent. In conjunction with the prior reports on Zika virus and West Nile virus, this work indicates that an off-pathway fusion state may be a feature of flavivirus fusion more broadly. We also note that the platform and mechanistic model described in this study may be useful in elucidating the mechanism of action of small molecule inhibitors of flavivirus fusion developed by our group and others.

Statement of SignificanceDengue virus (DENV) causes dengue fever and infects an estimated hundreds of millions of people annually. To date, there are no specific antiviral drugs for DENV and limited vaccination options, highlighting the need to better understand this important pathogen. In this report, we investigate the mechanism of DENV membrane fusion, an early step in the viral infectious cycle, using a mix of experimental techniques and computer simulations. We find strong evidence that the DENV fusion mechanism contains an off-pathway state, in which it can get stalled prior to membrane fusion. Understanding this off-pathway state could be an avenue to develop antiviral strategies against DENV and other related viruses."
"Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), whose populations contain multipotent skeletal stem cells with relevant therapeutic applications, are known to produce very heterogeneous colonies upon in vitro culture, a trait that may severely hinder the clinical usefulness of BMSC-based therapies. Therefore, reaching a better insight on the nature of such heterogeneity, as well as on the factors determining it, is important. Here, by using time-lapse microscopy, we study the structure of N = 28 human BMSC colonies from six donors, each colony derived from a single cell, and trace their lineage trees up to the seventh generation. We confirm the presence of very significant inter-colony and intra-colony heterogeneities, both in the topology of the lineages and in the replicative kinetics of the colonies. We also find that topology and kinetics are strongly correlated, consistent with the existence of regulating factors linking the sub-population of inactive cells, which uniquely determine a lineages topology, and that of active cells, which are the sole responsible for the proliferation rate of the colony. Finally, we submit each colony to an entropy-based inheritance test, which measures the degree of non-random clustering of inactive cells within the same branches of the lineage, and find a clear signature of hereditary transmission of the probability of emergence of inactive cells in the largest majority of the experimental lineages.

Author summaryThe topological structure of the lineage tree produced by the growth of a stem cell colony is uniquely determined by the number of its inactive cells and their position along the trees branches. Inactive cells do not divide (be it because they are temporarily quiescent, or because they are permanently senescent or differentiated), and therefore do not contribute to the statistics of the division times of the colony, while the active portion of the population proliferates with a kinetics that characterises the colonys growth as a whole. Being these two phenotypes (active vs inactive) well-separated from each other, there are no a priori reasons to expect a specific connection between the structure of the inactive part of the population and the replicative speed of the active part. However, we do find strong evidence of such connection in BMSCs: colonies with many inactive cells are also characterized by a slow growth of their active cells population, and vice versa. Interestingly, our experimental results cannot be explained by random fluctuations in the lineage structure, as an entropy-based inheritance test indicates that the probability of emergence of inactive cells has a strong hereditary character."
"Cryptosporidium is an apicomplexan parasite that causes diarrhoeal disease. The species C. parvum is zoonotic and causes significant morbidity and mortality for both humans and farm animals; most commonly, calves and lambs. A One Health approach that integrates human, animal and environmental health perspectives is required to tackle this disease. Current treatments are limited and ineffective, meaning there is an urgent need to develop new anti-cryptosporidials both for human and animal health. The neonatal calf model is a natural model of infection employed as a tool for drug discovery or generating parasite material. However, the model is seldom utilised to investigate host-parasite interaction. Fundamental information about this model, including the location of the parasite in the gut, is lacking. It is also unclear how the more commonly utilised immunocompromised mouse models of cryptosporidiosis compare to the neonatal calf model. To address this, we established an acute, moderate experimental C. parvum infection in neonatal calves. Using transgenic parasites, we created a tissue atlas of infection for neonatal calf gut and immunocompromised mouse models and mapped and quantified infection to draw robust comparisons between models. Cryptosporidium infection was observed at high levels throughout the neonatal calf gastrointestinal tract and was not limited to the ileal-cecal junction, as previously suggested. This infection pattern is most similar to the acute cryptosporidiosis mouse model, interferon-gamma knockout mice (IFN{gamma}KO). Infection with transgenic parasites allowed us to perform in vivo and ex vivo tissue imaging of the chronic cryptosporidiosis mouse model, NOD SCID Gamma KO (NSG) mice. In contrast, in NSG mice infection is low in the small intestines and highest in the caecum and colon. Understanding the true distribution of infection in the gastrointestinal tract of these three key animal models provides new perspectives on how to interpret and design drug efficacy studies and provides new insight into host-pathogen interaction."
"Mitochondria play critical roles in energy production and cellular metabolism. Despite the Warburg effect, mitochondria are crucial for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1), a key transcription factor in the cellular heat shock response, promotes malignancy and metastasis when aberrantly activated. To understand the multifaceted roles of HSF1 in cancer, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify epistatic interactors of HSF1 in cancer cell proliferation. The verified interactors of HSF1 include those involved in DNA replication and repair, transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression, and mitochondrial functions. Specifically, we found that HSF1 promotes cell proliferation, mitochondrial biogenesis, respiration, and ATP production in a manner dependent on TIMM17A, a subunit of the inner membrane translocase. HSF1 upregulates the steady-state level of the short-lived TIMM17A protein via its direct target genes, HSPD1 and HSPE1, which encode subunits of the mitochondrial chaperonin complex and are responsible for protein refolding once imported into the matrix. The HSF1- HSPD1/HSPE1-TIMM17A axis remodels the mitochondrial proteome to promote mitochondrial translation and energy production, thereby supporting robust cell proliferation. Our work reveals a mechanism by which mitochondria adjust protein uptake according to the folding capacity in the matrix by altering TIM complex composition."
"Geleophysic dysplasia (GD) is characterized by short stature, brachydactyly, joint limitations, a distinctive facial appearance, as well as cardiac and respiratory dysfunction that can be life-threatening. GD is caused by pathogenic variants in the ADAMTSL2, FBN1, or LTBP3 genes. While dermal fibroblasts derived from affected individuals have shown poor organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM), it remains elusive how the disorganized ECM contributes to GD pathogenesis. To understand the molecular mechanisms in GD, we isolated and characterized primary human dermal fibroblasts from affected individuals with ADAMTSL2 and FBN1 variants. We found that the secretion of ECM proteins including ADAMTSL2, FBN1, and Fibronectin were impaired in GD fibroblasts. Increased cell migration was observed in GD fibroblasts carrying ADAMTSL2 or FBN1 variants, which was associated with up-regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-14, two proteases related to cell mobility. The enhanced cell migration and up-regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-14 were corroborated in mouse primary dermal fibroblasts carrying pathogenic variants in Adamtsl2 and in lung and heart tissues from Adamtsl2-knockout mice. A pan MMP inhibitor, GM6001, inhibited the migration of GD fibroblasts. Overall, our results suggest that MMP-1/-14 up-regulation play a role in the development of GD and may be utilized as a treatment target."
"Enterococcus faecalis is a commensal bacterium that colonizes the gut of humans and animals, and a major opportunistic pathogen, known for causing multidrug-resistant healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Its ability to thrive in diverse environments and disseminate antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) across ecological niches highlights the importance of understanding its ecological, evolutionary, and epidemiological dynamics. The CRISPR2 locus has been used as a valuable marker for assessing clonality and phylogenetic relationships in E. faecalis. In this study, we identified a group of E. faecalis strains lacking CRISPR2, forming a distinct, well-supported clade. We demonstrate that this clade meets the genomic criteria for classification as a novel subspecies, here referred to as ""subspecies B"". Through a comprehensive pangenome analysis and comparative genomics, we explored the adaptive ecological traits underlying this diversification process, identifying clade-specific features and their predicted functional roles. Our findings suggest that the frequent isolation of subspecies B from meat products and processing facilities may reflect dissemination routes involving environmental contamination (e.g., water, plants, soil) from avian species. The absence of key virulence traits required for pathogenicity in mammals, particularly in humans, and the lack of clinically relevant resistance determinants indicate that subspecies B may currently pose minimal threat to public health compared to the broadly disseminated ""subspecies A"". Nevertheless, the unclear potential for genetic exchange between these subspecies, and the frequent association of subspecies B with food sources, calls for continued genomic surveillance of E. faecalis from a One Health perspective to detect and mitigate the emergence of high-risk variants in advance."
"Effective regulation of energy metabolism is critical for survival. Metabolic control involves various nuclei within the hypothalamus, which receive information about the bodys energy state and coordinate appropriate responses to maintain homeostasis, such as thermogenesis, pancreatic insulin secretion, and food-seeking behaviors. It has recently been found that the hippocampus, a brain region traditionally associated with memory and spatial navigation, is also involved in metabolic regulation. Specifically, hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs), which are high-frequency neural oscillations supporting memory consolidation and foraging decisions, have been shown to reduce peripheral glucose levels. However, whether SWRs are enhanced by recent feeding- when the need for glucose metabolism increases, and if so, whether feeding-dependent modulation of SWRs is communicated to other brain regions involved in metabolic regulation, remains unknown. To address these gaps, we recorded SWRs from the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus of mice during sleep sessions before and after consumption of meals of varying caloric values. We found that SWRs occurring during sleep are significantly enhanced following food intake, with the magnitude of enhancement being dependent on the caloric content of the meal. This pattern occurred under both food-deprived and ad libitum feeding conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate that GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, which are known to regulate food intake, exhibit a robust SWR-triggered increase in activity. These findings identify the satiety state as a factor modulating SWRs and suggest that hippocampal-lateral hypothalamic communication is a potential mechanism by which SWRs could modulate peripheral metabolism and food intake."
"The human diving reflex (DR), an innate defensive reflex triggered during periods of apnea, concurrently activates both the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system to regulate physiology against challenging demands. Despite pupil dilation and constriction being antagonistically controlled by the two autonomic branches, the effect of the diving reflex on pupil diameter fluctuations is still unknown. Thus, we compared participants pupil diameter fluctuations while breathing or performing apnea either with (Wet) or without (Dry) face immersion in cold water. We found that pupil diameter fluctuations in both apneic conditions are associated with lower power in the low-frequency band (< 0.25 Hz) while in the Wet condition, a reallocation of power towards higher frequencies (> 0.25 Hz) occurs, together with an increased entropy, contrary to the remaining conditions. This indicates a shift in autonomic balance and an increased complexity of pupil fluctuations during the diving reflex. Our findings present pupil dynamics as a valuable entry point to the exploration of autonomic adjustments for this reflex."
"1.This study explores the physiological and spectral responses of different species belonging the genus Cystoseira to varying concentrations of chromium (Cr) in controlled experimental conditions. The research highlights the potential of Cystoseira spp. as a bioindicator for monitoring heavy metal pollution in marine ecosystems. Experiments were conducted in tanks with increasing chromium concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, and 10 {micro}mol l-{superscript 1}), analyzing changes in reflectance, photosynthetic efficiency, and pigment composition over 14 days. Results showed dose-and time-dependent effects, with higher chromium levels causing significant photosynthetic inhibition, oxidative stress, and chlorophyll degradation. Spectral analyses identified key wavelengths (550 nm and 710 nm) correlating with chromium-induced stress, supporting their use in remote sensing for environmental monitoring. The study underscores the importance of integrating field validation and remote sensing for large-scale monitoring of marine ecosystems impacted by heavy metal contamination. These findings contribute to conservation strategies and the development of innovative tools for assessing the ecological quality of coastal waters."
"Gene drives offer revolutionary potential for the management of problematic plant populations, such as invasive weeds and herbicide-resistant species, by rapidly spreading desired genetic alterations. Two recent studies have provided the first experimental demonstrations of engineered CRISPR gene drive systems in plants (CAIN and ClvR). However, the successful application of such systems in the field will critically depend on an accurate understanding of plant-specific life-history traits, especially seed dormancy, a ubiquitous yet frequently overlooked eco-evolutionary force. In this study, we develop the first comprehensive modeling framework for gene drives in plant populations that incorporates a persistent soil seedbank. We show how the presence of a seedbank can significantly slow gene drive spread but also reduce the genetic load required to achieve population elimination. Furthermore, we show that seedbanks substantially increase the required introduction frequency of threshold-dependent gene drives, which could prevent establishment in some cases, yet also provide an intrinsic biosafety mechanism for confining a highly efficient drive to a target population. Our study highlights the need to incorporate seedbank dynamics into gene drive strategies to ensure realistic predictions and successful field applications."
"Regular expressions (regex) (Kleene 1951) have been an important tool for finding patterns in biological codes for decades (Hodgman 2000 and citations therein), and unlike fuzzy-finding approaches, do not result in approximate matches. The performance of regular expressions can be slow, however, especially when searching for matching patterns in large files. grepq is a Rust application that quickly filters FASTQ files by matching sequences to a set of regular expressions. grepq is designed with a focus on performance and scalability, is easy to install and easy to use, enabling users to quickly filter large FASTQ files, to enumerate named and unnamed variants, to update the order in which patterns are matched against sequences through in-built tune and summarise commands, and optionally, to output a SQLite file for further sequence analysis. grepq is open-source and available on GitHub and Crates.io."
"Genome- and phenome-wide association studies implicate the RNA demethylase FTO in alcohol use disorder (AUD), yet the RNA methylation landscape in AUD remains poorly characterized. Analyzing postmortem human basolateral amygdala (BLA) tissue, a key brain region in AUD-related behaviors, we found extensive m6A hypomethylation uniquely affecting circular RNAs (circRNAs). Notably, FKBP5-hosted circRNAs (circFKBP5s) exhibited pronounced hypomethylation correlating with elevated expression of FKBP5 mRNA isoforms. These findings were replicated in an animal model of alcohol dependence. Predictive analyses suggest that circFKBP5s influence genes involved in neurodevelopmental processes and neuronal identity. These findings uncover a novel aspect of AUD neurobiology linked to circRNA methylation."
"BackgroundIn humans, adolescence is a time of dynamic behavioral and emotional changes, including a transient decrease in affect associated with being among family members. It is not clear if a similar change occurs in rodent species used to model human psychiatric disorders. Here, we investigated in the developmental profile of the reward value of interactions with siblings across adolescence in mice.

MethodsSocial conditioned place preference test was performed in male mice representing early (around postnatal day 33 [P33]), middle (P38) and late (P43) adolescence stages. Additionally, social interaction in the partition test and cocaine conditioned place preference were measured to assess the specificity of changes observed in social reward.

ResultsThe reward value of interactions with siblings in adolescent male mice followed a similar course to that in humans: high in preadolescence, it decreased in mid-adolescence and returned to the initial level in late adolescence. No age-dependent changes in social interaction or in the preference for cocaine-conditioned context were detected.

LimitationsThe main limitation of our study is that it does not examine potential developmental changes in the proximate psychological mechanisms underlying social place preference.

ConclusionsTaken together, these data show similarities between mice and humans in developmental changes in sensitivity to the rewarding effects of interactions with familiar kin."
"Chromatin, a fundamental component of eukaryotic genomes, is categorized into euchromatin and heterochromatin, which play distinct roles in gene regulation. Although these two chromatin states are distinguished by their degree of condensation, quantitatively measuring the degree of chromatin condensation, as well as the physical properties of chromatin in living cells, remains challenging. In this study, label-free in situ quantitative imaging was performed using a Raman-Brillouin microscope to visualize the spatial distribution of molecular concentration and viscoelasticity within the nuclear environment of a living cell. A quantitative concentration distribution image of each intracellular biomolecule was obtained by combining Raman imaging with multivariate curve resolution analysis, using a water Raman band as an internal standard. Simultaneous Raman-Brillouin imaging enables the quantitative visualization of viscoelasticity within a cell. Using this approach, we found that, in addition to DNA, heterochromatin is enriched in lipids and that lipids play a critical role in heterochromatin formation, determining its mechanical properties. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of heterochromatin formation and its chemical and physical properties, leading to a comprehensive understanding of gene regulation and nuclear organization."
"Deep-mutational scanning (DMS) is a powerful technique that allows screening large libraries of mutants at high throughput. It has been used in many applications, including to estimate the fitness impact of all single mutants of entire proteins, to catalog drug resistance mutations and even to predict protein structure. Here, we present gy[o]za, a Snakemake-based workflow to analyze DMS data. gy[o]za requires little programming knowledge and comes with comprehensive documentation to help the user go from raw sequencing data to functional impact scores. Complete with quality control and an automatically generated HTML report, this new pipeline should facilitate the analysis of any DMS experiment. gy[o]za is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/durr1602/gyoza)."
"The cellular enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is required for NF-{kappa}B to activate inflammatory and immune response gene expression. NF-{kappa}B is also an important transcription factor in HIV-1 gene expression during active replication and latency reactivation. Therefore, enhancing NF-{kappa}B signaling is an alternative for HIV-1 latency reactivation, but significant systemic side effects related to the NF-{kappa}B role in inflammatory and immune responses are predictable. To verify this prediction, we determined whether PARP-1 is required in NF-{kappa}B-dependent HIV-1 gene expression in a human CD4+ T lymphoblastoid cell line (SUP-T1) and HEK 293T cells. Our findings indicated that PARP-1 knockout does not impair HIV-1 infection or gene expression. Specifically, NF-{kappa}B-dependent HIV-1 gene expression was not impaired by PARP-1 deficiency, highlighting an important transcriptional regulatory difference between HIV-1 and inflammatory and immune activation genes. Our findings define a negligible role of PARP-1 in HIV-1 gene expression, suggesting that PARP-1 antagonism could ameliorate the expected inflammatory response with latency-reactivating agents that act through the NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway.

ImportancePARP-1 is required for NF-{kappa}B to activate the expression of inflammatory and immune response genes. NF-{kappa}B is also an important transcription factor in HIV-1 gene expression during active replication and latency reactivation. Enhancing NF-{kappa}B signaling is expected to cause HIV-1 latency reactivation, but significant systemic side effects related to the NF-{kappa}B role in inflammatory and immune responses are predictable. The role of PARP-1 in NF-{kappa}B-mediated activation of HIV-1 gene expression and in viral infection has not been determined in the context of HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells. Our data indicate that PARP-1 is dispensable for NF-{kappa}B-mediated activation of HIV-1 gene expression in a human CD4+ T lymphoblastoid cell line. These findings suggest that the pharmacological antagonism of PARP-1 could diminish the inflammatory effects of latency-reactivating agents that activate NF-{kappa}B signaling without impairing their effect on HIV-1 gene expression."
"Human papillomavirus (HPV) genomes replicate and partition as minichromosomes alongside host chromatin during persistent infection. However, it is difficult to monitor genome dynamics in living cells because the small and compact genome will not easily tolerate expression cassettes. Here, we use ANCHOR technology to detect HPV18 genomes in living cells. We incorporated the cis element from ANCHORTM technology into the late region of the HPV18 genome and expressed the ParB-GFP protein from an HPV18-dependent replicon. The replicon contains the HPV18 replication origin and viral transcriptional enhancer element and can replicate stably in keratinocytes when complemented by the HPV18 genome. This small replicon expresses the neomycin resistance gene in both bacteria and eukaryotic cells and has minimal prokaryotic elements that could induce innate immunity. This molecular tool enables us to indirectly monitor the presence of the virus by detecting these fluorescent proteins in live cells and allows for real-time tracking of replicating HPV18-ANCH3 genomes in proliferating keratinocytes to inform on models of HPV genome maintenance, tethering, and amplification. Here, we visualize partitioning of the viral DNA in dividing cells and show that HPV18-ANCH genomes are distributed somewhat equally to daughter cells by random attachment to host chromosomes.

ImportanceIn persistent HPV infection, the viral genome is maintained at a constant copy number, replicates in synchrony with host DNA during S-phase, and is partitioned into daughter cells. The exact method by which HPVs partition to daughter cells is not well understood and the elucidation of such mechanisms may reveal relevant pharmacological targets to combat persistent HPV infection."
"Many arthropods, including insects, harbor endosymbiotic bacteria. As bacteria transitioned to live inside host cells, free-living bacterial ancestors of endosymbionts reduced their genomes in a process known as streamlining. Contemporary endosymbioses represent at least two distinct life strategies: endosymbionts either become unilaterally dependent on host-derived resources (uni-obligate) or enter bidirectionally obligate mutualistic relationships (bi-obligate endosymbiosis). It is an open question whether these paths taken by free-living bacteria can be sequential, or alternatively, if commitment takes place early, making these strategies mutually exclusive. In this study, we quantified metabolic capacity of different endosymbionts to contextualize genome streamlining in terms of organismal function. We show that uni-obligate endosymbionts of insects have lost substantial parts of their metabolic capacity that are present both in free-living bacteria and bi-obligate endosymbionts. On the contrary, genomes of uni-obligate endosymbionts contain more genes which can be attributed to scavenging host resources. In sum, we challenge the existing notion that bi-obligate endosymbionts have emerged from uni-obligate ones, and rather, propose a stochastic ratchet model: in early stages of endosymbiosis, bacteria get locked into either a more mutualistic or more parasitic relationship with the host depending on the first losses during streamlining."
"Gliomas are among the most lethal cancers, with limited treatment options. To uncover hallmarks of therapeutic escape and tumor microenvironment (TME) evolution, we applied spatial proteomics, transcriptomics, and glycomics to 670 lesions from 310 adult and pediatric patients. Single-cell analysis shows high B7H3+ tumor cell prevalence in glioblastoma (GBM) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA), while most gliomas, including pediatric cases, express targetable tumor antigens in less than 50% of tumor cells, potentially explaining trial failures. Longitudinal samples of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant gliomas reveal recurrence driven by tumor-immune spatial reorganization, shifting from T-cell and vasculature-associated myeloid cell-enriched niches to microglia and CD206+ macrophage-dominated tumors. Multi-omic integration identified N-glycosylation as the best classifier of grade, while the immune transcriptome best predicted GBM survival. Provided as a community resource, this study opens new avenues for glioma targeting, classification, outcome prediction, and a baseline of TME composition across all stages."
"Quality Control (QC) of samples is an essential preliminary step in cytometry data analysis. Notably, identification of potential batch effects and outlying samples is paramount, to avoid mistaking these effects for true biological signal in downstream analyses. However, this task can prove to be delicate and tedious, especially for datasets with dozens of samples.

Here, we present CytoMDS, a Bioconductor package implementing a dedicated method for low dimensional representation of cytometry samples composed of marker expressions for up to millions of single cells. This method allows a global representation of all samples of a study, with one single point per sample, in such a way that projected distances can be visually interpreted. CytoMDS uses Earth Movers Distance for assessing dissimilarities between multi-dimensional distributions of marker expression, and Multi Dimensional Scaling for low dimensional projection of distances. Some additional visualization tools, both for projection quality diagnosis and for user interpretation of the projection coordinates, are also provided in the package.

We demonstrate the strengths and advantages of CytoMDS for QC of cytometry data on three real biological datasets, revealing the presence of low quality samples, batch effects and biological signal between sample groups."
"Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1, L1) retrotransposons are the most abundant protein-coding transposable elements (TE) in mammalian genomes, and have shaped genome content over 170 million years of evolution. LINE-1 is self-propagating and mobilizes other sequences, including Alu elements. Occasionally, LINE-1 forms chimeric insertions with non-coding RNAs and mRNAs. U6 spliceosomal small nuclear RNA/LINE-1 chimeras are best known, though there are no comprehensive catalogs of LINE-1 chimeras. To address this, we developed TiMEstamp, a computational pipeline that leverages multiple sequence alignments (MSA) to estimate the age of LINE-1 insertions and identify candidate chimeric insertions where an adjacent sequence arrives contemporaneously. Candidates were refined by detecting hallmark features of L1 retrotransposition, such as target site duplication (TSD). Applying this pipeline to the human genome, we recovered all known species of LINE-1 chimeras and discovered new chimeric insertions involving small RNAs, Alu elements, and mRNA fragments. Some insertions are compatible with known mechanisms, such as RNA ligation. Other structures nominate novel mechanisms, such as trans-splicing. We also see evidence that LINE-1 loci with defunct promoters can acquire regulatory elements from nearby genes to restore retrotransposition activity. These discoveries highlight the recombinatory potential of LINE-1 RNA with implications for genome evolution and TE domestication.

"BackgroundMaladaptive changes in the function, expression and localization of proteins involved in calcium-handling worsen the impaired contractility of systolic heart failure (HF). Standard proteomics techniques require cell lysis and so are unable to characterize changes specific to the critical sub-cellular domain bounded by the T-tubule and the sarcoplasmic reticulum, known as the cardiac dyad. Traditional approaches are also less likely to capture low-affinity protein-protein interactions on lipid membranes. To improve our understanding of heart failure pathophysiology, we applied proximity proteomics to the cardiac dyad of mice with ischemic cardiomyopathy.

MethodsUsing two lines of transgenic mice expressing fusion proteins of the engineered ascorbate peroxidase APEX2 with subunits of the cardiac voltage gated calcium channel, CaV1.2, we labeled the dyad proteome of live, intact myocytes from healthy mice (N=6) and mice with coronary artery ligation HF (N=5) by peroxidase-catalyzed biotinylation. Quantitative mass spectrometry with isobaric tandem mass tags (TMT) was used to assess alterations in the local dyad proteome in myocytes from mice with chronic, remodeled HF. We subsequently generated a mouse with inducible cardiac overexpression of Galectin-1 to examine the effects of this protein on cardiac function and more specifically on the calcium-handling properties of mature myocytes, using cellular electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and echocardiography.

ResultsFrom mice with HF, we found significant enrichment of 43 proteins defined by their abundance and proximity to transgenic CaV1.2 1C channels, and a significant reduction in 22 proteins, out a of a total of 2326 proteins quantified. We also significantly enriched 286 proteins, and saw a reduction in 13 proteins, defined by proximity and abundance to CaV1.2 {beta}2B-subunits, out of a total 2236 proteins identified. Pathway analysis revealed HF is associated with increased abundance of components of the 26s proteasome and microtubules in the dyad, as well as the dimerizing, carbohydrate binding protein Galectin-1. Cardiac specific overexpression of Galectin-1 in healthy mice increases activation of CaV1.2 and the Ryanodine receptor and accelerates myocyte relaxation through phosphorylation of Phospholamban.

ConclusionsUsing proximity proteomics to examine the effects of HF in vivo, we find increased localization of Galectin-1 to the cardiac dyad, and that overexpression of Galectin-1 accelerates calcium kinetics in the heart."
"Children with Down syndrome have a 150-fold increased risk of developing myeloid leukaemia (ML-DS). Unusually for a childhood leukaemia, ML-DS arises from a preleukaemic state, termed transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM), via a conserved sequence of mutations. Here, we examined the relationship between the genetic and transcriptional evolution of ML-DS from natural variation; a rich collection of primary patient samples and fetal tissues with a range of constitutional karyotypes. We distilled transcriptional consequences of each genetic step in ML-DS evolution, utilising single cell mRNA sequencing, complemented by phylogenetic analyses in progressive disease. We found that transcriptional changes induced by the TAM-defining GATA1 mutations are retained in, and account for most of the ML-DS transcriptome. The GATA1 transcriptome pervaded all stages of ML-DS, including progressive disease that had undergone genetic evolution. Our approach delineates the transcriptional evolution of ML-DS and provides an analytical blueprint for distilling consequences of mutations within their pathophysiological context."
"Ketamine is a fast-acting, long-lasting novel antidepressant. However, underpinning intracellular mechanisms remain unclear. We conducted an unbiased screening for genes that were less expressed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mice that did not display antidepression-like effects to ketamine. GO analysis implicated endoplasmic reticulum and protein folding; in particular, GRP78, a stress-induced chaperone protein critical for protein folding, was reduced. We showed that GRP78 deficiency in PFC neurons induced depressive-like behaviors, whereas its overexpression produced anti-depression-like effects, revealing a novel function of GRP78. Prefrontal GRP78 was necessary for ketamines antidepressant-like effects. GRP78 was also required for ketamine to increase calcium activity and glutamatergic transmission. Enhancing GRP78 by viral infection and azoramide enabled non-responsive mice to respond to ketamine. Together, our results demonstrate that GRP78 is critical for ketamine to execute antidepressant effects by potentiating glutamatergic transmission in the PFC.

HighlightsO_LIGRP78 was identified in non-biased screens for proteins that were lower in the PFC of mice that failed to exhibit antidepression-like effects after ketamine.

"Duration and frequency of mating are the most prominent aspects of mating behaviour over which sexual conflict can occur. Parthenium beetle (Zygogramma bicolorata) exhibits an extremely high mating rate, with each mating typically lasting several hours. We investigated mating behaviour in this beetle to assess if there is sexual conflict. Theories of sexual conflict predict that such mating behaviour, while being beneficial to the males, should be detrimental to the females with regard to reproduction and/or survival. We experimentally manipulated the length and number of matings, and examined the effect on fecundity and survivorship of the females. While long mating has previously been identified as a mate-guarding strategy that benefits the males, our data reveal that it is detrimental to female fitness, supporting the sexual conflict hypothesis. Further, we checked natural variation in mating duration and its correlation with key fitness components. Our results show that female longevity is negatively correlated to reproductive rate, but positively correlated to lifetime reproduction. We argue that such a pattern is consistent with sexual conflict. While being the first clear demonstration of sexual conflict in this species, we discuss its significance, including a potential role in reducing its efficacy as a biocontrol."
"To learn complex motor skills, an organism must be able to assign sensory feedback events to the actions that caused them. This matching problem would be simple if motor neuron output led sensory feedback with a fixed, predictable lag. However, nonlinear dynamics in the brain and the bodys periphery can decouple the timing of critical events from that of the motor output which caused them. During human speech production, for example, phonation from the glottis (a sound source for speech) begins suddenly when subglottal pressure and laryngeal tension cross a sharp threshold (i.e. a bifurcation). Only if the brain can predict the timing of these discrete peripheral events resulting from motor output, then, would it be possible to match sensory feedback to movements based on temporal coherence. We show that event onsets in the human glottal waveform, as measured using electroglottography, are reflected in the human electroencephalogram during speech production, leading up to the time of the event itself. Conversely, glottal event times can be decoded from the electroencephalogram. After prolonged exposure to delayed auditory feedback, subjects recalibrate their behavioral threshold for detecting temporal auditory-motor mismatches, and decoded event times decouple from actual movements. This suggests decoding performance is driven by plastic predictions of peripheral timing, providing a missing component for hindsight credit assignment in motor control, in which specific feedback events are associated with the neural activity that gave rise to movements. We discuss parallel findings from the birdsong system suggesting that results may generalize across vocal learning species.

Significance StatementTo learn complex motor skills such as speech, the brain must pair actions with sensory feedback. However, feedback is delayed in time relative to actual movement, rendering this ""hindsight credit assignment"" problem a nontrivial task. We present evidence that events in the glottis, the articulatory organ that generates sound for human speech, are predictively encoded in the human brain during speech production. Given that corresponding events in auditory feedback are known to be prominently encoded in cortex, this highlights a common temporal marker by which articulatory gestures and sensory feedback could be aligned. Findings suggest activity in the human vocomotor system is shaped by biophysical dynamics in the vocal periphery, aligning with corresponding results in the birdsong system."
"Density-dependent selection has been widely studied in D. melanogaster in the context of larval crowding, revealing its impact on several life-history traits. However, the effects of adult crowding in Drosophila have not been studied in similar detail. Earlier studies on adult crowding have primarily used large flies (reared at low larval density). These gave rise to the notion that adult crowding negatively affects key fitness components such as mortality and fecundity. Earlier work from our lab showed that body size significantly alters how flies respond to a relatively short period of adult crowding. Large flies show increased mortality and decreased fecundity with increased adult density. In contrast, small flies (reared at high larval density) tolerate adult crowding better, showing increased fecundity with increased adult density. Here, we extend this line of work by investigating how air volume in a culture vial can influence the effects of adult crowding. We manipulated air volume by altering the vial diameter (thereby also the food surface area), or the height of the air column. Flies of different body sizes were generated by rearing them at low or high larval densities. We find that the surface area of food available to the adults plays a greater role in shaping the outcome of adult crowding than the height of the air column. Large flies displayed context-dependent responses to adult crowding that were driven by the surface area of food provided. Small flies consistently responded positively to adult crowding in all conditions, with low mortality and increased fecundity at high adult density. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the body size, absolute density and the food surface area available to the flies and their nuanced interactions while exploring the effects of adult crowding, and thus paves the way for a detailed examination of other factors that impact adult crowding in addition to just the overall density."
"Flatworms are increasingly recognized for their ecological significance and potential to disrupt local fauna, yet most research has focused on conspicuous, larger planarians. Smaller flatworms, or microturbellarians, are often top predators within meiofaunal food webs. Here, we report a novel interaction involving a rhabdocoel microturbellarian, Strongylostoma simplex, predating on Daphnia water flea embryos. We identified the flatworm based on histological serial sections and recognized key diagnostic traits. In a laboratory experiment, we tested for survival and offspring production of Daphnia magna in the presence and absence of Strongylostoma simplex. Exposure to flatworms caused a drastic reduction in water flea fitness, indicated by the strongly reduced survival and offspring production in flatworm-exposed Daphnia. This finding corroborates our visual observations of egg predation by these flatworms, and suggests a strong pressure on Daphnia population dynamics. This is particularly concerning for small or isolated water bodies, such as the water reservoirs located in a cemetery in Berlin in which we documented this interaction, as this would increase the probability of encounters between flatworms and water fleas. As Daphnia play an essential role in regulating phytoplankton blooms and supporting higher trophic levels in freshwater ecosystems, understanding the ecological consequences of potentially invasive predatory flatworms is imperative."
"Uropathogenic Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, are of major concern of with respect to antimicrobial resistance, which has sparked interest in phage therapy as an alternative, or compliment to antibiotics. However, very limited in vivo data on phage therapy safety and efficacy for treating UTIs is available. To address this, we developed a model to test these parameters for a phage cocktail optimised for Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella UTI strains. Female C57BL/6J mice were infected with K. pneumoniae Top52 then received a single dose of the purified therapeutic phages, with observations over seven days. Results showed a significant reduction of bacterial burden in urine, bladder, and kidney samples starting from 4 h post-treatment until Day 7. Phage treatment also reduced local inflammation within the bladder. Additionally, cytokine profile demonstrated an increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 and a decrease in pro-inflammatory IL-6, indicating a synergy between phage and the host immune response."
"Genetic resources for species monitoring should ideally be relevant for the species full distribution range, feasible economically and logistically, and validated for the range of sample types collected from the field. This is particularly important for large carnivores that are elusive and wide-ranging, where individual and population processes often traverse administrative borders, and where obtaining high-quality samples can be challenging. Here we present a small species-specific SNP panel for leopards. We used whole genome data from across the global range and RAD sequence data from Zambian leopards to select markers for assay development. These were ascertained for 590 individual leopards from eight African countries and final selection was based on marker variation and performance on non-invasive samples. The final 96 marker panel holds 5 mitochondrial markers for species recognition, 3 Y-markers for determination of individual sex, 3 X-markers and 85 somatic markers, with an associated genetic baseline holding nearly 900 individuals. The selected autosomal markers hold variation across the global range with high power to identify individuals (PID=2,45x10-35) and in most cases their provenance with high assignment probability (>95%). Markers were also selected based on their performance on samples with low target DNA content, with distinct genotype separation in the output marker plots. The genotypes from this panel are thus straightforward to analyze and do not require computationally challenging bioinformatic resources, making this a low cost and accessible resource for leopard monitoring and research."
"1.Protein language models (PLMs) are increasingly used to assess the impact of genetic variation on proteins. By leveraging sequence information alone, PLMs achieve high performance and accuracy and can outperform traditional pathogenicity predictors specifically designed to identify harmful variants contributing to diseases. PLMs can perform zero-shot inference, making predictions without task-specific fine-tuning, offering a simpler and less overfitting-prone alternative to complex methods. However, studying in-frame insertions and deletions (indels) with PLMs remains challenging. Indels alter protein length, making direct comparisons between wildtype and mutant sequences not straightforward. Additionally, indel pathogenicity is less studied than other genetic variants, such as single nucleotide variants, resulting in a lack of annotated datasets. Despite these challenges, approaches that leverage PLMs through transfer learning have emerged, making it possible to capture the features needed for more accurate predictions. Still, the current approaches are limited in terms of allowed organisms, indel length, and interpretability. In this work, we devise a new scoring approach for indel pathogenicity prediction (IndeLLM) that provides a solution for the difference in protein lengths. Our method only uses sequence information and zero-shot inference with a fraction of computing time while achieving performances similar to other indel pathogenicity predictors. We used our approach to construct a simple transfer learning approach for a Siamese network, which outperformed all tested indel pathogenicity prediction methods (Matthews correlation coefficient = 0.77). IndeLLM is universally applicable across species since PLMs are trained on diverse protein sequences. To enhance accessibility, we designed a plug-and-play Google Colab notebook that allows easy use of IndeLLM and visualisation of the impact of indels on protein sequence and structure. The tool is available on GitHub https://github.com/OriolGraCar/IndeLLM and Colab https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CgwprttaNFR_KeJGyFzP0a0C9Y wc4P.

"Astronauts consistently exhibit slower movements in microgravity, even during tasks requiring rapid responses. The sensorimotor mechanisms underlying this general slowing remain debated. Two competing hypotheses have been proposed: either the sensorimotor system adopts a conservative control strategy for safety and postural stability, or the system underestimates body mass due to reduced inputs from proprioceptive receptors. To resolve the debate, we studied twelve taikonauts aboard the China Space Station performing a classical hand-reaching task. Compared to their pre-flight performance and to an age-matched control group, participants showed increased movement durations and altered kinematic profiles in microgravity. Model-based analyses of motor control parameters revealed that these changes stemmed from reduced initial force generation in the feedforward control phase followed by compensatory feedback-based corrections. These findings support the body mass underestimation hypothesis while refuting the strategic slowing hypothesis. Importantly, sensory estimate of bodily property in microgravity is biased but evaded from sensorimotor adaptation, calling for an extension of existing theories of motor learning."
"Gene knockout strain collections are important tools for discovery in microbiology. Cryptococcus neoformans is the only human pathogenic fungus with an available genome-wide deletion collection, and this resource is widely used by the research community. We uncovered mix-ups in the assembly of the commercially available C. neoformans deletion collection of [~]6,000 unique strains acquired by our lab. While pursuing the characterization of a gene-of-interest, the corresponding deletion strain from the C. neoformans KO collection displayed several interesting phenotypes associated with virulence. However, RNAseq analysis identified transcripts for the putative knockout gene, and the absence of transcripts for a different knockout strain found in the same plate position in an earlier partial knockout collection, raising the possibility that plates from one collection were substituted for the other. This was supported by determining the size of the nourseothricin (NAT)-resistance cassette used to generate the two separate knockout libraries and was confirmed by RNAseq and genome sequencing. Here we report that our KN99 collection is comprised of mixed plates from two independent KO libraries and present a simple authentication method that other investigators can use to distinguish the identities of these KO collections.

"Synthetic metal chelators are widely used in industrial, clinical, and agricultural settings, leading to their accumulation in the environment. We measured the growth of Caulobacter crescentus, a soil and aquatic bacterium, in the presence of the ubiquitous chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and found that it restricts growth by lowering intracellular iron levels. Using barcoded transposon sequencing, we identified an operonic gene pair, cciT-cciO, that is required to maintain iron homeostasis in laboratory media during EDTA challenge. cciT encodes one of four TonB-dependent transporters that are regulated by the ferric uptake repressor (Fur) and stands out among this group of genes in its ability to support Caulobacter growth across diverse media conditions. The function of CciT strictly requires cciO, which encodes a cytoplasmic FeII dioxygenase-family protein. Our results thus define a functional partnership between an outer membrane iron receptor and a cytoplasmic dioxygenase that are broadly co-conserved in Proteobacteria. We expanded our analysis to natural environments by examining the growth of mutant strains in freshwater from two lakes, each with biochemical and geochemical profiles that differ markedly from standard laboratory media. In lake water, Caulobacter growth did not require cciT or cciO and was less affected by EDTA treatment. This result aligns with our observation that EDTA toxicity is influenced by common forms of biologically chelated iron and the spectrum of free cations present in the medium. Our study defines a conserved iron acquisition system in Proteobacteria and bridges laboratory-based physiology studies with real-world conditions.

IMPORTANCEMetal-chelating chemicals are widely used across industries, including as preservatives in the food sector, but their full impact on microbial physiology is not well understood. We identified two genes, cciT and cciO, that function together to support Caulobacter crescentus iron balance when cells are exposed to the common synthetic chelator, EDTA. CciT is an outer membrane transporter and CciO is a dioxygenase-family protein that are mutually conserved in many bacteria, including several human pathogens, where mutations in cciT homologs are linked to clinical resistance to the siderophore antibiotic, cefiderocol. This study identifies a conserved genetic system that supports iron homeostasis during chelation stress and illuminates the iron acquisition versatility and stress resilience of Caulobacter in freshwater environments."
"Neomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, has robust antibacterial properties, yet its clinical utility is curtailed by its nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. The mechanism by which the polycationic neomycin enters specific eukaryotic cell types remains poorly understood. In budding yeast, NEO1 is required for neomycin resistance and encodes a phospholipid flippase that establishes membrane asymmetry. Here, we show that mutations altering Neo1 substrate recognition cause neomycin hypersensitivity by exposing phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) in the plasma membrane extracellular leaflet. Human cells also expose extracellular PI4P upon knockdown of ATP9A, a Neo1 ortholog and ATP9A expression level correlates to neomycin sensitivity. In yeast, the extracellular PI4P is initially produced in the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane and then delivered by Osh6-dependent nonvesicular transport to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, a portion of PI4P escapes degradation by the Sac1 phosphatase by entering the ER lumenal leaflet. COPII vesicles transport lumenal PI4P to the Golgi where Neo1 flips this substrate back to the cytosolic leaflet. Cryo-EM reveals that PI4P binds Neo1 within the substrate translocation pathway. Loss of Neo1 activity in the Golgi allows secretion of extracellular PI4P, which serves as a neomycin receptor and facilitates its endocytic uptake. These findings unveil novel mechanisms of aminoglycoside sensitivity and phosphoinositide homeostasis, with important implications for signaling by extracellular phosphoinositides."
"Premise of the studyPlant traits are closely associated with species functions and environmental responses, and their compilation is particularly essential for large-scale studies. Although several databases of plant trait information have been published, comprehensive information on plant traits is lacking. To address this issue, additional easy-to-use data sources are required. This study examined digital text from descriptions of occurrences in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) as a novel source of plant trait information and evaluated its potential to mitigate existing gaps.

MethodsWe focused on the digital text available from descriptions of occurrences in GBIF as a novel source of plant trait information. We collected information on life span, growth form, and maximum plant height for vascular plants from GBIF and other common trait databases. Using the resultant dataset, we compared the reliability (i.e., congruence of trait values in the focal database with that of the representative database) of trait values in GBIF with those from other databases and evaluated their novelty.

Key resultsThe trait information extracted from the GBIF exhibited reliability comparable to that of common plant trait databases. Additionally, the number of species with trait values increased 1.2-2.7 times when incorporating species data obtained solely from the GBIF with those from other databases.

ConclusionsAlthough digital texts in GBIF have not been previously used as a source of plant trait information, the results indicate that GBIF may be a valuable source of plant trait information."
"Plasma cell subsets vary in their lifespans and ability to sustain humoral immunity. We conducted a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen in myeloma cells for factors that promote surface expression of CD98, a marker of longevity in mouse plasma cells. A large fraction of genes found to promote CD98 expression in this screen are involved in secretory and other vesicles, including subunits of the V-type ATPase complex. Genetic ablation and chemical inhibition of V-type ATPases in myeloma cells and primary plasma cells, respectively, reduced antibody secretion. Mouse and human long-lived plasma cells had greater numbers of acidified vesicles than their short-lived counterparts, and this correlated with increased antibody secretory capacity. The screen also revealed a requirement for the signaling adapter MYD88 in CD98 expression. Plasma cell-specific deletion of Myd88 led to reduced survival and antibody secretion by antigen-specific cells in vivo and unresponsiveness to BAFF and APRIL ex vivo. These data reveal novel regulators that link plasma cell secretory capacity and lifespan.

SummaryLong-lived plasma cells rely on V-type ATPases, PI4K, DDX3X, and MYD88 signals for maximal secretory capacity and survival"
"Predicting the fitness of mutations in the evolution of pathogens is a long-standing and important, yet largely unsolved problem. In this study, we used SARS-CoV-2 as a model system to explore whether the intrahost diversity of viral infections could provide clues on the relative fitness of single amino acid variants (SAVs). To do so, we analysed [~]15 million complete genomes and nearly [~]8000 sequencing libraries generated from SARS-CoV-2 infections, which were collected at various timepoints during the COVID-19 pandemic. Across timepoints, we found that many of the SAVs that went on to reach high frequency could be detected in the intrahost diversity of samples collected at a median of 3-22 months prior. Additionally, we found that genetic linkage patterns observed at the interhost level can also be observed in the intrahost diversity of infections. Application of machine learning models allowed us to learn highly generalisable intrahost, physiochemical and phenotypic patterns to forecast the future fitness of intrahost SAVs (r2=0.48-0.63). Most of these models performed significantly better when considering genetic linkage between mutations (r2=0.53-0.67), pointing to epistasis being an important determinant in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our results highlight the predictive power of intrahost diversity data, and document the evolutionary forces shaping the fitness of mutations. Such insights offer potential to forecast the emergence of future variants and ultimately inform the design of vaccine targets."
"In recent years, cyclic peptides have emerged as a research hotspot in drug development due to their excellent stability, high specificity, and potential to penetrate intracellular targets. However, existing computational models still face challenges in making accurate predictions of the structures of cyclic peptides containing unnatural amino acids (unAAs), thereby limiting their application in drug design. The release of AlphaFold 3 (AF3) has significantly improved the modeling capability of biomolecular complexes and supports the definition of unAAs through residue modifications using the CCD database (Chemical Component Dictionary). Yet, its reliance on structures already present in the training library limits its ability to accurately predict cyclic peptide structures. Base on the AlphaFold 3 framework, we developed HighFold3, which comprises two sub-models: HighFold3-Linear and HighFold3-Cyclic, designed for predicting the structures of linear and cyclic peptides, respectively. Our research results show that, by incorporating a cyclic peptide positional preference matrix, HighFold3 achieves superior performance over other models (HighFold, HighFold2, and CyclicBoltz1) in predicting cyclic peptide structures, particularly excelling in complex cyclic peptides containing unAAs. HighFold3 provides an efficient tool for cyclic peptide drug design, promising to advance the application of cyclic peptides in targeted therapy, antibacterial treatments, and cellular penetration."
"Iron (Fe) and water availability are closely interlinked, with deficiencies in both adversely affecting soybean growth. However, the strategies employed by soybean to tolerate such conditions remain poorly understood. This study elucidates the interactions of host factors, and microbial associations using multi-omics approaches in Clark (tolerant) and Arisoy (sensitive) genotypes exposed to Fe deficiency and drought. Clark exhibited resilience to stress through sustained osmotic regulation, nutrient uptake, and photosynthetic activity, in contrast to Arisoy. Particularly, Fe retention in Clark, accompanied by the upregulation of ferritin-like proteins, may mitigate oxidative stress by reducing Fenton reactions. Furthermore, higher jasmonic and salicylic acid levels in Clark may contribute to its enhanced stress adaptation compared to Arisoy. RNA-seq analysis revealed 818 and 500 upregulated, along with 931 and 361 downregulated genes, in the roots of Clark and Arisoy, respectively, under stress. We observed the upregulation of symbiotic genes, such as Chalcone-flavonone isomerase 1 and SWEET10, accompanied by increased rhizosphere siderophore and root flavonoid in Clark. This indicates a significant role of microbes in mediating differential stress tolerance in soybean. Particularly, the combined stress led to distinct root and nodule microbiome dynamics, with Clark recruiting beneficial microbes such as Variovorax and Paecilomyces, whereas Arisoy exhibited the opposite pattern. In addition, Clark maintained nodule Bradyrhizobium and tissue nitrogen status, supported by ammonium retention and induction of Ammonium transporter 1 in the roots. Furthermore, in vitro compatibility between V. paradoxus and P. lilacinus suggests a synergistic interaction, with their localized signals benefiting Clark. Remarkably, enriched microbiomes significantly improved growth parameters, accompanied by elevated rhizosphere siderophore in sensitive genotypes under stress. This study is the first to uncover mechanisms of dual stress tolerance in soybean that may offer promising targets for breeding programs and microbiome-based biofertilizer strategies to improve combined stress tolerance in soybean and other legumes.

HighlightIron retention coupled with symbiotic associations driven by the enrichment of Variovorax and Paecilomyces in the roots confers tolerance to combined iron deficiency and drought in soybean."
"Dissolved organic matter (DOM), the largest reservoir of organic material in the ocean, plays a crucial role in the global nutrient cycle and the microbial loop. While existing studies have documented significant DOM release by zooplankton, the chemo diversity and properties of this DOM, along with the physiological mechanisms influencing these characteristics in the environment, remain inadequately explored. We conducted zooplankton sampling followed by onboard DOM release experiments in heterogeneous estuarine-coastal water systems, followed by molecular characterization of the DOM using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Additionally, we analyzed zooplankton metabolic activities through meta-transcriptomics to elucidate the relationship between the chemical properties of the released DOM and the underlying physiological processes of zooplankton. Our findings reveal substantial variations in the molecular diversity of DOM released by zooplankton, more specifically lipids-like, protein-like, and unsaturated hydrocarbon-like between mesotrophic and eutrophic coastal zooplankton communities. We found strong correlations between chemical composition of the DOM and zooplankton gene functions associated with metabolism processes such as carbohydrate metabolism, nucleotide processing, energy production, and coenzyme metabolism. Furthermore, the modified aromaticity indexes of the released DOM are also highly associated with metabolism-related gene functions such as amino acid, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid, energy production, as well as glycan biosynthesis, indicating that zooplankton metabolic processes significantly influence DOM aromaticity. This study enhances our understanding of how organisms metabolic processes shape the molecular characteristics of DOM they release, highlighting its implications for nutrient cycling in the environment."
"Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for noninvasive diagnostics and monitoring of aberrant methylation. However, computational deconvolution of cfDNA remains challenging due to the complexity of methylation data, the diverse cellular compositions in cfDNA mixtures, and the limited interpretability of current methods. We present cfDecon, an efficient deep-learning framework for cfDNA deconvolution at the resolution of individual reads. cfDecon employs a multichannel autoencoder core module and an iterative refinement process to estimate cell-type proportions and generate condition-aware cell-type-specific methylation profiles. We rigorously evaluate cfDecon through comprehensive simulation experiments, including scenarios with normal cellular compositions, rare cell types, and unknown cell types, where cfDecon consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in deconvolution. Using strict data separation and careful control for potential data leakage, cfDecon shows scalability and applicability to large-scale studies by raising Lins Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over 33% on an atlas-level reference dataset. We further validate cfDecons utility in disease diagnosis on two clinical datasets, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). cfDecon raises the performance of disease detection from 0.53 to 0.79 compared to existing methods on the ALS dataset and 0.55 to 0.77 on the HCC dataset. The capacity of cfDecon to predict condition-specific DNA methylation patterns across cell types offers a valuable framework for studying differentially methylated CpGs. Furthermore, integrating cfDecon with enrichment analysis facilitates the exploration of functional variations in CpGs across different conditions. cfDecon represents a significant advancement in cfDNA analysis, offering improved accuracy, interpretability, and potential for personalized medicine applications. The codebase is available at https://github.com/Susanxuan/cfDecon."
"Identifying key residues that govern protein function, stability, and interactions remains a significant challenge in protein engineering. We present an information-theoretic approach, inspired by signal processing methods to detect such  key tuning residues from protein sequences. Our approach integrates both unsupervised and supervised methods using Shannon entropy and mutual information as initial priors, respectively. A key aspect of our method is the use of Cramers V and Thiels U to decouple coevolved residues. The supervised method combining mutual information and evolutionary decoupling, significantly outperforms an existing state of the art, DeepSequence, (pvalue = 0.0149). The unsupervised approach that requires only a BLAST derived multiple sequence alignment (MSA) offers a simple yet competitive alternative (pvalue = 0.014). We validated our methods by applying them to three distinct protein datasets: Green Fluorescent Proteins (GFPs), rhodopsins, and alkanal monooxygenases, demonstrating a high predictive efficacy compared to established tools. When applied to well-characterised nanobody-antigen interactions, our methods not only effectively identified the binding residues but also accurately reconstructed a contiguous binding surface, surpassing current state-of-the-art computational tools. This work provides a flexible, interpretable, computationally efficient and transparent strategy for identifying key residues, paving the way for new strategies in rational protein design, enzyme optimization and drug discovery."
"Hair cells and their apically located stereocilia bundle are responsible for detecting sound and balance, by converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals through the mechano-electric transduction (MET) channels, located at the lower end of the tip link connecting adjacent stereocilia. A long-studied regulation of the MET process is slow adaptation, which is hypothesized to contribute to the auditory systems remarkable dynamic range. Recent studies challenged the old model of slow adaptation which centered around myosin motors. We support a new model of slow adaptation that relies on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) interactions with the MET complex protein Tmie. First, we further support the hypothesized location of the slow adaptation mechanism at the lower end of the tip link by showing that slow adaptation is independent of myosin VIIa, located at the upper end of the tip link. Next, in both cochlear and vestibular hair cells, we demonstrate the reliance of slow adaptation on PIP2. Most strikingly, slow adaptation was rescued with exogenous PIP2 when myosin motors were inhibited, indicating the primary importance of PIP2. Finally, we suggest the importance of Tmie that binds PIP2 in the slow adaptation mechanism. These data support a new model of slow adaptation where PIP2 interactions with Tmie mediate slow adaptation in mammalian hair cells with myosin motors having a classic cargo transport role."
"For the successful transmission of malaria parasites from humans to mosquitoes, Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes must remain in the bloodstream long enough to be taken up by a mosquito. Once ingested, they are then activated into gametes to continue the parasite life cycle in the mosquito midgut. Both persistence of gametocytes in the blood and their activation into gametes are tightly regulated by phospho-signaling. While the serine-threonine phosphatase PfPP1 is an essential enzyme for parasite asexual proliferation, its role during transmission of sexual stages remains elusive. Here, we employed a conditional depletion strategy to conduct a functional analysis of PfPP1 during gametocyte development, gamete activation and transmission to mosquitoes. We show that PfPP1 regulates the deformability and the permeability of mature gametocyte-infected erythrocytes through the dephosphorylation of PKA substrates, thus highlighting a key role for PfPP1 in modulating the host cell mechanical properties, which are crucial for gametocyte persistence in the bloodstream. We also provide evidence that PfPP1 controls crucial steps of gamete activation via stimulation of the cGMP/ PKG pathway. Collectively, these results underscore the pivotal role of PfPP1 in the transmission of P. falciparum to the mosquito during both sexual development and gamete activation.

AUTHOR SUMMARYThe protein phosphatase PP1 is a major contributor to total cellular phosphatase activity in eukaryotes and plays a critical role during various cellular processes. Here, we have unraveled novel mechanisms regulated by the phosphatase PfPP1 in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. While PfPP1 is known to be essential for the parasite asexual proliferation, in the present study we demonstrate that PfPP1 is also required during the sexual parasite stages, called gametocytes, that ensure parasite transmission from humans to mosquitoes. PfPP1 is involved in regulating the mechanical properties of the gametocyte-infected host cell, a process necessary for the persistence of gametocytes in blood circulation. Moreover, PfPP1 also contributes to the activation of gametocytes into gametes, the stages able to pursue the parasite life cycle in mosquitoes. In addition to providing insights into novel mechanisms involved in parasite transmission, this study also highlights the possibility of interfering with PfPP1 signaling pathway for blocking malarial parasite transmission."
"Vigna luteola, a wild legume species, shows remarkable variation in salinity tolerance across its natural habitats, with coastal populations exhibiting high tolerance and riverbank populations being sensitive. This intraspecific variation provides a valuable system for investigating the genetic basis of salt tolerance. A major QTL for salt tolerance was previously identified by crossing salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive accessions, but the responsible genes remain unknown. In this study, grafting experiments between the two accessions revealed that the root plays a primary role in salt tolerance by suppressing Na transport to the shoot. We then conducted root transcriptome analysis and identified four candidate genes located within the QTL and highly expressed under salt stress in the tolerant accession: CBL-INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE 6 (CIPK6), CAFFEOYL SHIKIMATE ESTERASE (CSE), FCS-LIKE ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 13 (FLZ13), and DROUGHT-INDUCED 21 (DI21). Promoter analysis revealed that the CIPK6 promoter contains transcription factor binding motifs unique to the salt-tolerant accession, which may contribute to its high expression under salt stress. These findings suggest that CIPK6 is regulated by cis-regulatory differences and is the most promising candidate for the salt-tolerance QTL. The identified genes in this study provide a foundation for developing salt-tolerant crops in the future."
"The development of mechanically tunable DNA-based supramolecular hydrogels that recapitulate the dynamic mechanoelastic properties of native extracellular matrices (ECMs) is critical for advancing 3D tissue engineering. DNA supramolecular hydrogels with their precise programmable architecture and impeccable control at the nanometre scale assembly make them a highly lucrative biopolymer in the design of ECM-mimicking scaffolds. This study explores the fabrication of stiffness-customizable rigid DNA hydrogels with varying branching architectures, including Double Crossovers (DX), Paranemic Crossovers (PX), and Tensegrity motif structures with three to six arms. Our study reveals that by incorporating different numbers of crossovers, branching arms, and the type of sticky-armed linkers, it is possible to generate a range of DNA hydrogels with varying network geometry and mechanoelastic properties ranging from 50-300 kPa, without any chemical / enzymatic crosslinking aid. These DNA hydrogels mechanoregulate cellular behaviour in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE1) cells by enhancing cellular adhesion, elongation (3 - 8x area increase vs. control), viability (concentration-dependent, 1 - 8x vs. control), organellar homeostasis, including mitochondrial fragmentation and ER stress attenuation. This work establishes a framework for automating DNA hydrogel-based scaffold fabrication processes to meet the preferences of various cells/tissues with bespoke mechanical cues, advancing personalized high-throughput tissue engineering platforms.

"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multisystem genetic disorder associated with a wide range of symptoms, including the formation of tumours along nerves. These tumours can affect nerve function, leading to pain and loss of sensory or motor capacity. Drug treatments are currently limited, and relatively few new targets have emerged for NF1 tumors despite intensive research. Therefore, new drugs to target NF1-deficient tumour cells are urgently required. Here, we have used a cross-species screening strategy combined with bioinformatic analysis to identify candidates with a high chance of successful translation to humans. First, we used data from a synthetic lethal screen performed in Drosophila cells to identify novel drug targets of NF1. Then, we performed statistical enrichment analysis of the screen results to identify further candidate targets that were not conserved between Drosophila and humans and could not have been found in the screen. We identified and validated hTERT as a synthetic lethal partner gene to NF1 with high potential as a therapeutic drug target, using the FDA-approved inhibitor azidothymidine (AZT). The lethal effect of AZT was validated in peripheral neurofibroma NF1-deficient human cell lines and NF1-deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour cells. The effect of AZT was also conserved in vivo, highlighting the translational potential; treatment of mice with AZT inhibited NF1 mutant xenograft growth to the same extent as the current clinically approved MEK inhibitor, selumetinib. Finally, we show that combined treatment with AZT and selumetinib resulted in a further synergistic reduction in NF1-deficient human cell viability. In conclusion, AZT represents a promising novel therapeutic for the treatment of NF1 tumours, either alone or in combination with selumetinib."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal lung disease characterized by dysregulated wound healing, leading to excessive production of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, particularly collagen, by activated fibroblasts. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a soluble protein associated with ECM remodeling in bone, has been found in higher levels in serum and lung tissue of IPF patients compared to controls. However, whether OPG is associated with ECM remodeling by fibroblasts in lung fibrosis remains poorly understood. In this study we assessed differences in OPG levels in ECM-derived hydrogels from non-disease controls and patients with IPF encapsulated with primary human lung fibroblasts from control and patients with IPF (7 days). OPG levels were assessed in a collected culture medium and stained lung tissue sections, and related to biomechanical properties.

Fibrotic human lung fibroblasts secreted and deposited more OPG compared to controls, which was observed in both non-diseased and IPF ECM hydrogels. OPG levels correlated significantly with matrix stiffness and collagen fiber structural properties, but only in IPF hydrogels, independent of fibroblast source. Strikingly, we also observed opposite correlations for control and fibrotic fibroblasts in fibrotic hydrogels. Control fibroblasts within a fibrotic microenvironment, secreted less OPG when hydrogel stiffness increased and deposited more OPG when collagen fibers were more aligned. Interestingly, fibrotic fibroblasts secreted more OPG when collagen fiber length increased and when collagen fiber curvature increased. Overall, our findings suggest that control and fibrotic lung fibroblasts exhibited opposite behavior with respect to OPG and ECM remodeling under fibrotic conditions and this may have consequences for matrix stiffness"
"The role of amino-acid residues distant from an enzymes active site in facilitating the complete catalytic cycle--including substrate binding, chemical transformation, and product release-- remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate how distal mutations promote the catalytic cycle by engineering mutants of three de novo Kemp eliminases containing either active-site or distal mutations identified through directed evolution. Kinetic analyses, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that while active-site mutations create preorganized catalytic sites for efficient chemical transformation, distal mutations enhance catalysis by facilitating substrate binding and product release through tuning structural dynamics to widen the active-site entrance and reorganize surface loops. These distinct contributions work synergistically to improve overall activity, demonstrating that a well-organized active site, though necessary, is not sufficient for optimal catalysis. Our findings reveal critical roles that distal residues play in shaping the catalytic cycle to enhance efficiency, yielding valuable insights for enzyme design."
"Species barriers are shaped by variation in recombination coupled with natural selection [1-3]. Canids lost the Prdm9 gene 40-60 million years ago [4-6], stabilising low recombination at the centromeric ends [7] of acrocentric autosomes despite overall high recombination rates [6]. We predict canid recombination architecture will tend to maintain barriers to gene flow at one end of autosomes while eroding them at the other. Polarization [8] of 31 million single nucleotide variants (SNVs) across 980 canid genomes reveals elevated barriers to gene flow at pericentromeric regions between grey wolves, coyotes and golden jackals. Highly diagnostic SNVs are six-fold enriched in pericentromeric regions. The exception is the barrier to gene flow between dogs and wolves, which accumulated divergence differently from other comparisons: genomes of domesticated dogs preserve ancient genetic diversity lost in contemporary grey wolf populations, positioning them as reservoirs of ancestral alleles. Our results show that genome architecture modulates permeability of barriers to gene flow, pointing to pericentromeric regions as targets for reinforcement selection that may maintain canid taxa."
"ObjectivesMindfulness is a promising health intervention, showing potential effects on cognitive functions like memory. Despite evidence suggesting mindfulness improves working memory, inconsistencies in results and methodologies prevent definitive conclusions. This meta-analysis examines the effects of mindfulness interventions on working memory across clinical and healthy populations, and various age groups.

MethodsA systematic search for relevant English and Persian articles was conducted in WOS, Scopus, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases, along with nine meta-analyses up to February 2023. Included studies consisted of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled trials (CTs), and single-group studies. Overall, 29 studies with 2076 participants aged 5-85 years were analyzed.

ResultsMindfulness interventions demonstrated a medium effect size on working memory: RCT two-group studies (Hedges g = 0.438, p < 0.001), CT two-group studies (Hedges g = 0.385, p < 0.005), and single-group studies (Hedges g = 0.583, p < 0.001). These findings confirm the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions in improving working memory.

ConclusionsMindfulness interventions exhibit promising effects on working memory. However, further primary research, particularly rigorous RCTs, is needed to better understand their impacts on clinical versus healthy populations and across diverse age groups."
"The incorporation of a functional perfusable microvascular network (MVN) is a common requirement for most organ on-chip-models. Long-term perfusion of MVNs is often required for the maturation of organ phenotypes and disease pathologies and to model the transport of cells and drugs entering organs. In our microphysiological system, we observe that flow can recover perfusion in regressed MVNs and maintain perfusable MVNs for at least 51 days. Throughout the 51 days, however, the MVNs are continuously remodeling to align with the direction of bulk flow and only appear to attain morphological homeostasis with the use of maintenance medium without growth factors. We observed that the flow resistance of the MVNs decreases over time, and using a computational model, we show that stable vessels have higher flow rates and velocities compared to regressing vessels. Cytokine analysis suggests that static conditions generate an inflammatory state, and that continuous flow reduces inflammation over an extended period. Finally, through bulk RNA sequencing we identify that both the endothelial and fibroblast cells are actively engaged in vascular and matrix remodeling due to flow and that these effects persist for at least 2 weeks. This MPS can be applied to study hemodynamically driven processes, such as metastatic dissemination or drug distribution, or to model long-term diseases previously not captured by MPS, such as chronic inflammation or aging-associated diseases."
"Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) normally exist in a contractile state but can undergo fate switching to produce various cell phenotypes in response to pathologic stimuli1-3. In atherosclerosis, these phenotypically modulated SMCs regulate plaque composition and influence the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events4,5. We found that PRDM16, a transcription factor that is genetically associated with cardiovascular disease, is highly expressed in arterial SMCs and downregulated during SMC fate switching in human and mouse atherosclerosis. Loss of Prdm16 in SMCs of mice activates a synthetic modulation program under homeostatic conditions. Single cell analyses show that loss of Prdm16 drives a synthetic program in all SMC populations. Upon exposure to atherogenic stimuli, SMC-selective Prdm16 deficient mice develop SMC-rich, fibroproliferative plaques that contain few foam cells. Acute loss of Prdm16 results in the formation of collagen-rich lesions with thick fibrous caps. Reciprocally, increasing PRDM16 expression in SMCs blocks synthetic processes, including migration, proliferation, and fibrosis. Mechanistically, PRDM16 binds to chromatin and decreases activating histone marks at synthetic genes. Altogether, these results define PRDM16 as a critical determinant of SMC identity and atherosclerotic lesion composition."
"Loss of function of the astrocyte protein MLC1 causes Megalencephalic Leukoencephalopathy with subcortical Cysts (MLC), a leukodystrophy characterized by white matter edema and slow neurological deterioration. MLC1 dysfunction leads to swelling of perivascular astrocyte endfeet and an impaired attachment of endfeet to blood vessels. In isolated primary astrocytes, loss of MLC1 hinders recovery of astrocytes from cell swelling, but the cellular function of MLC1 is not completely understood. MLC1 modulates gating of mechanosensitive ion channels involved in volume regulation. The cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in cell volume regulation, and interactions between the cytoskeleton and cell membrane affect the properties of mechanosensitive ion channels. Therefore, we investigated whether primary Mlc1-null mouse astrocytes show a disruption in their mechanical properties. We measured mechanical properties of cultured primary astrocytes with an indentation technique and demonstrated that Mlc1-null astrocytes are softer than wild-type astrocytes. Proteomic analysis confirmed dysregulation of several cytoskeleton-related pathways in Mlc1-null astrocytes. Confocal imaging revealed that organization of the actin cytoskeleton is unaffected. Instead, we observed alterations in focal adhesions, which aid in relaying mechanical forces between the cytoskeleton, cell membrane, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Together, our findings reveal that the mechanical properties of Mlc1-null astrocytes are altered, and that disrupted cytoskeleton-membrane-ECM interactions potentially play a role in the disease. Modulators of astrocyte mechanobiology might therefore hold promise for MLC therapy development."
"Childhood abuse (CA) is one of the strongest lifetime predictors of major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicide. However, some individuals exposed to CA are resilient, avoiding the development of psychopathology. Recently, the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic (LC-NE) system has been involved in resilience following stressful events at adulthood. We investigated how a history of CA affects the integrity of the LC-NE system at the molecular and cellular level in human post-mortem brain samples of depressed suicides, and whether differential neurobiological mechanisms can be revealed in resilient individuals. Anatomical analysis revealed that CA-induced MDD and suicide is associated with decrease in LC-NE neurons density. RNA sequencing of laser captured LC-NE neurons highlighted differentially expressed genes, principally in the RES-CA group. Resilience to CA involves specific neurobiological adaptations in the LC-NE system that potentially protect against the loss of LC-NE neurons and the negative long-term outcome of CA-induced depression and suicide. Our results provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for preventing or treating CA-induced MDD."
"Functional gait assessments in older adults have traditionally required manual in-person quantification of clinically-relevant metrics such as walking speed and step placement. This reliance on individuals trained in motion analysis hinders the frequency with which they are performed, and reduces their generalizability and replicability. To standardize and simplify gait assessments, we here leverage recently-developed open-source tools to produce a low-cost, AI driven markerless motion capture system with custom analysis for Functional Gait Assessment, using 3 Cameras. Validation of data collected with a traditional marker-based system on subjects (N=3) showed strong correlation to laboratory-standard measures of step length (R2=0.98), step width (R2=0.97), and head speed (R2=0.95), suggesting that open-source markerless systems are sufficient to be used in gait assessments. The markerless system demonstrated data similar to previous FGA findings in older adult subjects (N=5). Supplemental measurements are proposed that augment existing FGA workflows with standard biomechanical gait measures Step Width, walking Duration, and continuous Gait Speed. This markerless motion capture system demonstrates a proof-of-principle system for performing analyses of functional gait."
"N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is present in food, water, and drugs and is considered a probable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The mechanism of action of NDMA involves the generation of carcinogenic methyl lesions such as 3-methyladenine (3MeA) on DNA bases. Alkyladenine DNA Glycosylase (AAG) removes 3MeA to initiate Base Excision Repair, leaving an intermediary lesion that is subsequently resolved by backbone cleavage, nucleotide insertion, and backbone ligation. The intermediate steps following lesion removal produce potentially toxic and mutagenic single-strand DNA breaks. Here, we explored differences between males and females regarding downstream DNA damage, toxicity, mutations and cancer arising from 3MeA in the livers of WT, Aag-/-, and Aag-overexpressing (AagTg) mice. We found that males were more susceptible to NDMA-induced mutations (WT and Aag-/-) and cancer (all genotypes). In contrast, AagTg females were more prone than males to micronucleus induction. As we showed in our prior analyses where data were pooled for males and females, Aag-/- mice were significantly more susceptible to NDMA-induced mutations and cancer, and AagTg mice displayed significantly greater toxicity. Building on these findings, our analyses of sex-related differences show that Aag deficiency and maleness are both susceptibility factors for NDMA-induced liver cancer, while Aag overexpression drives toxicity, potentially with a greater effect on females. By assessing differences between males and females, this study reveals a deeper mechanistic understanding of the underpinnings for a well-known increased risk of liver cancer in men versus women by demonstrating a higher susceptibility of male mice to both mutations and cancer."
"The stop-signal task is often used to study inhibitory control. When combined with electrophysiological recordings, the N2 and P3 event-related potentials (ERPs) are regularly observed. Numerous studies link both amplitude and latency differences of the N2 and P3 to failed versus successful stopping. A slower N2-P3 complex when stopping fails has repeatedly been reported across many studies and found to correlate moderately with behavioral stopping speed. However, most studies rely on averaging across trials, thereby limiting the examination of trial-by-trial dynamics. In the present study, we employed different machine learning-approaches to classify successful from failed stop trials based on time-frequency single-trial EEG data. We also tested whether attenuating the slowing effect would alter classification performance. To preserve interpretability, we first identified five group-level EEG components time-locked to stopping and then used the time-frequency representation as features in different models. Our findings suggest that regularized logistic regression can reliably classify successful from failed stopping with an AUC = 0.72. Correcting for ERP latency differences did not markedly reduce overall classification (i.e., AUC = 0.71), but the model had to compensate by leveraging subtler, broadly distributed time-frequency features. Our feature importance measure indicated that a component closely resembling the N2-P3 complex contributed largely to the classification performance, producing a sparse model. Once the slowing effect was attenuated in the data, the model still retained predictive performance but had to rely on 15 times as many time-frequency features across the five components. Thus, it is likely that multiple overlapping processes unfold during stopping that influence response inhibition in addition to the N2-P3 complex. While the N2-P3 complex is consistently evoked during stopping and carry large discriminative ability, considering additional auxiliary processes might further our understanding into mechanisms underlying response inhibition."
"Difficulties in adapting learning to meet the challenges of uncertain and changing environments are widely thought to play a central role in internalizing psychopathology, including anxiety and depression. This view stems from findings linking trait anxiety and transdiagnostic internalizing symptoms to learning impairments in laboratory tasks often used as proxies for real-world behavioral flexibility. These tasks typically require learners to adjust learning rates dynamically in response to uncertainty, for instance, increasing learning from prediction errors in volatile environments. However, prior studies have produced inconsistent and sometimes contradictory findings regarding the nature and extent of learning impairments in populations with internalizing disorders. To address this, we conducted eight experiments (N = 820) using predictive inference and reversal learning tasks, and applied a bi-factor analysis to capture internalizing symptom variance shared across and differentiated between anxiety and depression. While we observed robust evidence for adaptive learning-rate modulation across participants, we found no convincing evidence of a systematic relationship between internalizing symptoms and either learning rates or task performance. These findings challenge prominent claims that learning difficulties are a hallmark feature of internalizing psychopathology and suggest that the relationship between these traits and adaptive behavior under uncertainty may be more subtle than previously thought."
"Bang-sensitive (BS) Drosophila mutants exhibit a stereotyped pattern of seizure behavior after mechanical disturbances. We previously identified mutations in the julius seizure (jus) gene, formerly CG14509, can induce BS seizures. However, the behavioral manifestations of the seizure phenotype of the various jus mutants have not been fully characterized. Here, we developed a machine learning pipeline featuring LASC (Long short-term memory and Attention mechanism for Sequence Classification) for automatic phenotyping of jus mutant videos. LASC achieves 90% classification accuracy in distinguishing five phases: paralysis (P), tonic seizure (T), spasm (S), clonic seizure (C), and recovery (R). Applying the trained LASC model to multiple jus lines showed they use a common repertoire of seizure stages and followed the general P[-&gt;]T[-&gt;]S[-&gt;]C[-&gt;]R progression, but each genotype exhibited unique patterns of stage duration and transition probabilities. Remarkably, stage usage patterns are distinct among the mutant genotypes. These findings establish that while all jus mutants adhere to stereotyped behavioral rules, each allele generates a distinct signature in stage usage. This work demonstrates how advanced behavioral quantification can reveal previously hidden relationships between gene mutation and complex motor outputs. More broadly, the complete pipeline presented here can pave the way for high-throughput, automated drug screening for epilepsy."
"Polyploidy (whole-genome multiplication) is a common yet under-surveyed property of tissues across multicellular organisms. Polyploidy plays a critical role during tissue development, following acute stress, and during disease progression. Common methods to reveal polyploidy involve either destroying tissue architecture by cell isolation or by tedious identification of individual nuclei in intact tissue. Therefore, there is a critical need for rapid and high-throughput ploidy quantification using images of nuclei in intact tissues. Here, we present iSPy (Inferring Spatial Ploidy), a new unsupervised learning pipeline that is designed to create a spatial map of nuclear ploidy across a tissue of interest. We demonstrate the use of iSPy in Arabidopsis, Drosophila, and human tissue. iSPy can be adapted for a variety of tissue preparations, including whole mount and sectioned. This high-throughput pipeline will facilitate rapid and sensitive identification of nuclear ploidy in diverse biological contexts and organisms."
"High-throughput mutagenesis screens are powerful tools for mapping mutations to phenotypes. However, deciphering the molecular mechanisms that link mutations to phenotypic outcomes remains a significant challenge. Here, we present ProTiler-Mut, a versatile computational framework that harnesses tiling mutagenesis screens, which introduce variants across entire protein sequences, to facilitate investigation of mutation-to-phenotype associations at multiple levels, including individual residues, protein substructures, and protein-protein interactions (PPIs). As demonstrated through our analyses of base editing (BE) screens targeting DNA Damage Response (DDR) proteins and T cell regulators, ProTiler-Mut provides novel insights into the mutation-phenotype linkages, including: i) refined classification of mutation that reveals separation-of-function (SOF) category beyond the conventional binary classification of loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF); ii) definition of phenotype-associated hotspot substructures that enable the inference of the function of unscreened pathogenic mutations; and iii) identification of phenotype-associated PPIs disrupted by functional mutations. Through ProTiler-Mut analyses, we identified a substructure harboring pathogenic GOF mutations that disrupt interactions between the kinases MAPK1 and RSK1, leading to MAPK1 activation and elevated expression of the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of ProTiler-Mut to various mutagenesis screening platforms, highlighting its broad utility and generalizability."
"While adaptive radiations significantly contribute to the worlds biodiversity, much is unknown about the genetic and ecological factors underlying these rapid successions of speciation. It has been suggested that hybridisation can facilitate the speciation process by generating genetic diversity on which diversifying selection can act. Sailfin silverside fishes (Telmatherinidae) in the Malili Lakes system in Sulawesi have diversified within the last 2 million years. We assembled and annotated a chromosome-scale reference genome of the riverine sailfin silverside Telmatherina bonti and generated whole genome sequences of all species of Telmatherina in Lake Matano, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, one of the worlds oldest and deepest lakes. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships within the adaptive radiation of sailfin silversides and inferred past and ongoing introgression patterns. Genome-wide tests confirmed two monophyletic clades, sharpfins and roundfins. However, within clades, we found mismatches between morphology-based taxonomic assignments and genome-wide genetic relationships. We found signs of both old and ongoing introgression between river-dwelling T. bonti and the lacustrine sharpfin group, as shown in elevated D-statistic, f4-ratio and f-branch statistic. Levels of excess allele sharing between riverine species and the three most common lacustrine species declined with increasing distance from the river-inlet, indicating ongoing introgression at the lake-river interface. This combination of past and ongoing hybridisation in a radiating species flock makes Lake Matano Telmatherina a particularly valuable system to study fundamental mechanisms driving rapid speciation under genomic exchange. The phylogenomic framework elaborated in this study provides the foundation for studies of the processes shaping this charismatic radiation."
"This study investigates the neural basis of sound perception in everyday life using EEG data recorded in an office-like environment over 3.5 hours. We investigated how contextual factors such as personal relevance, task complexity and stimulus properties influence auditory processing in ecologically valid settings. By systematically increasing the complexity of acoustic scenes and tasks, we analysed changes in neural responses, particularly in the N100 and P300 components. Our results show that while the P300 is a stable marker of attention in both isolated sounds and complex soundscapes, the N100 is more sensitive to task complexity and environmental factors. This highlights the importance of context in shaping auditory perception. Furthermore, our results suggest that laboratory-based findings can be partially generalised to real-world settings, although task demands significantly influence neural markers. These findings provide new opportunities to study sound perception in naturalistic settings, without sacrificing the control typically afforded by laboratory studies."
"How are past experiences reconstructed from memory? Learning is thought to compress external inputs into low-dimensional hippocampal representations, later expanded into high-dimensional cortical activity during recall. Hippocampal ripples--brief high-frequency bursts linked to retrieval--may initiate this expansion. Analysing intracranial EEG data from patients with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy during an episodic memory task, we found that cortical dimensionality increased following ripple events during correct, but not incorrect, retrieval. This expansion correlated with faster reaction times and reinstatement of the target association. Crucially, hippocampal theta and cortical gamma phase-amplitude coupling emerged after ripples but before cortical expansion, suggesting a mechanism for ripple-driven communication. Ripple events also marked the separation of task-relevant variables in cortical state space, revealing how hippocampal output reshapes the geometry of memory representations to support successful recall."
"Social support is a potentially protective factor against substance use disorders (SUDs). Previous studies in animal models for SUDs have shown that when females are pair housed, they have lower motivation for cocaine and methamphetamine (METH) than females who are single housed. In males, however, social housing has not had the same beneficial effect. This study investigates effects of social housing on METH self-administration in females or males when both cage mates are self-administering METH. The study also investigated how the quality of the relationships changed after METH self-administration. The results show that singly housed females self-administered more METH than socially housed females, while males in both social housing conditions self-administered METH at the same rate. The social behavior data showed that females given saline spent more time apart, however the females given METH spent more time together, suggesting that their social behavior may play a role in the attenuation of METH self-administration. Males social behavior remained unchanged after METH and the dominant male in a pair self-administered more METH than the non-dominant male. Females self-administration was not affected by dominance. The results of this study show that social housing provides some protective benefits to females, but not males, for METH self-administration. Further, the type of relationship between cage mates affects males self-administration and may explain why social housing with a same sex mate is not beneficial for males.

STRUCTURED ABSTRACT

BackgroundSocial support is a potentially protective factor against substance use disorders (SUDs). Previous studies in rats have shown that when females are pair housed, they have lower motivation for drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine (METH), than females who are single housed. In males, however, socially housed and singly housed males both have the same motivation for drugs such as cocaine.

PurposeThe aim of this study was to investigate if social housing would attenuate METH self-administration in females or males when both cage mates are self-administering METH on an intermittent access schedule (IntA). The study also investigated how the quality of those relationships changed after METH self-administration, if dominance played a role in the rate of self-administration, and the extent to which the quality of the relationships was related to METH self-administration.

MethodsMale and female rats were individually housed or housed in same sex pairs from around day 42, then animals underwent self-administration of METH (0.3 mg/kg/inf) on an IntA schedule of reinforcement. Both animals in a pair self-administered METH. Social behavior was evaluated prior to and throughout the period when animals were self-administering METH.

ResultsThe results showed that in females, single housed females self-administered more METH than pair housed females, while males in both housing conditions self-administered METH at the same rate. More singly housed females on day one of the IntA had high rates of self-administration, compared to socially housed females. Differences attenuated after the first session, but singly housed females still self-administered METH to a greater extent than pair housed females overall. The social behavior data showed that females given saline spent more time apart while the females given METH spent more time together. This suggested that social behavior may contribute to the attenuation of self-administration in females. Males social behavior largely remained unchanged after METH and males continued to exhibit dominance behaviors. Furthermore, males METH self-administration was affected by dominance, with dominant males exhibiting greater responding for METH than non-dominant males.

ConclusionsSocial housing provides some protective benefits to females, but not males, for METH self-administration. Further, the type of relationship between cage mates affects males self-administration and may explain why social housing with a same sex mate is not beneficial for males.

"ARID1A, a key subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is frequently mutated in cancers. However, effective clinical treatments for patients with this mutation are limited, highlighting a demand for new therapeutic strategies. Here, we establish Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase (WRN) as a critical vulnerability target in ARID1A-mutated cancers. Upon genetic and pharmacological inhibition of WRN, ARID1A-mutated cells had defective Chk1-mediated DNA damage signaling, resulting in compensatory Chk2 activation, leading to G1-phase arrest and apoptosis, whereas ARID1A-proficient cells underwent Chk1-dependent G2/M arrest. Additional p21 inhibition, combined with WRN suppression, drove G1-arrested cells to re-enter the cell cycle, triggering mitotic catastrophe. The anti-tumor efficacy of WRN inhibition was validated using in vivo cell lines and patient-derived xenograft mouse models. Our findings define WRN as a selective therapeutic target in ARID1A-mutated cancers and suggest a combinatorial strategy of WRN and p21 inhibition as a therapeutic approach."
"Studies of gene regulation require measurements of mRNA and protein levels of a regulated gene. Recently, parallel reporter assays have been introduced to study the regulation of multiple genes at once. While transcriptional regulation can be probed by next generation sequencing, post-transcriptional regulation requires the ability to measure multiple proteins in the same experiment. Multiplexing with the help of fluorescent proteins limits the addressable diversity of simultaneous measurements due to spectral overlap. Inspired by the utility of proteotypic peptides in targeted proteomics, here we show that genetically encoded peptide reporters (peptide barcodes) can be used to analyze multiple post-transcriptional pathways in parallel. We use RNA interference as an exemplary regulatory mechanism that occurs on both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. We measure the activity of multiple microRNAs in parallel using a peptide barcode-based miRNA sensor library. Fluorescent reporters are used to validate the accuracy of the miRNA activities reported via the peptide barcodes. Several assay optimization steps are explored leading to the robust activity profiling of nine miRNAs across three different cell lines. Overall, this study underlines the multiplexing potential of peptide barcodes to rapidly and quantitatively measure the post-transcriptional regulation."
"O_LIStep selection functions (SSFs) examine the factors that motivate animal movement by pairing observed steps with unobserved ""comparison steps"" and quantifying the effects of covariates corresponding to the values of the factors at each observed step. Traditionally, SSFs are fit with conditional logistic regression (CLR) models, which explicitly reflect how an animal must decide between an observed step and other available steps. These models, however, cannot infer nonlinear effects unless the specific parametric form (e.g., quadratic) of the nonlinear effect is specified.
C_LIO_LITo enable more general inference of nonlinear effects, we propose replacing CLR with random forests (RFs). Using a fitted model, we also describe how to plot the relationship between changes in the value of a covariate upon the likelihood that the animal will select a given step with those covariate values (an ""effect curve"").
C_LIO_LITo evaluate our models and their corresponding effect curves, we simulated tracks with various nonlinear effects. RFs yield effect curves that closely resemble the specified nonlinear effect curves, achieving mean R2 = 0.953 and outperforming a CLR model with quadratic terms and spline-based generalized additive models. Additionally, we applied our best-performing RF to real wolf data (Barry et al., 2020). The resulting effect curves confirm the authors assumptions that their covariates affect wolf movement according to a step function.
C_LIO_LIThese results suggest that RFs may be used either to discover unknown nonlinear step selection effects or to confirm previously hypothesized nonlinear effects. Going forward, we envision the use of RFs as an approach that complements existing SSF approaches, providing insights about nonlinear relationships between covariate values and the effects that they have on animal movement decisions.

"Microbial communities significantly impact medicine, biotechnology, and agriculture. Advanced sequencing technologies have generated extensive microbiome data, enabling the discovery of substantial evolutionary and ecological patterns. However, traditional supervised learning methods struggle to capture universal patterns in microbial community data, largely due to the large data heterogeneity and profound batch effects among samples, rendering it difficult to classify samples as well as detect biomarkers from millions of samples, not to say the intricate but important dynamic patterns from a variety of contextualized sceneries. In this study, we propose MGM, a context-aware, attention-based foundation model, pre-trained on a dataset of 263,302 microbiome samples (Microcorpus-260K) via language modeling. MGM demonstrated significant improvements in microbial community classification compared to traditional machine learning methods. Additionally, MGM has enabled contextualized classification, effectively overcomes cross-regional limitations, showing enhanced performance on intercontinental datasets through transfer learning. Furthermore, fine-tuning MGM on a longitudinal infant dataset revealed distinct keystone genera during development, with Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium exhibiting higher attention weights in vaginal deliveries, and Haemophilus in cesarean deliveries. Finally, through in silico modeling, the model also uncovered novel microbial dynamic patterns in a Crohn disease cohort following antibiotic treatment. In conclusion, by leveraging self-attention and autoregressive pre-training, MGM serves as a versatile model for various downstream microbiome tasks and holds significant potential for achieving contextualized aims."
"O_LIReintroduction of keystone species is considered part of the solution to the current biodiversity crisis. The Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) is one such species, shaping its habitat by felling trees, building dams and creating wetlands. However, while the potential benefits to aquatic biodiversity and ecological functioning have been studied on a local scale, the impacts of beavers on catchment-scale processes such as fish migration remain understudied.
C_LIO_LISequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA metabarcoding) from water samples is a cost-effective method to study species distributions across large geographical scales. Here, eDNA samples (n=426) were collected from 142 sites across the UKs oldest and largest established wild beaver population, located on Tayside, East Scotland, and analysed using a vertebrate specific metabarcoding assay. We combined presence/absence data from eDNA results with other environmental and anthropogenic variables to model the effects of beaver presence on the distribution of three migratory fish species.
C_LIO_LIUsing generalised linear models, we found no effects of the current beaver presence on the distribution of Atlantic salmon or lamprey, but a positive co-occurrence with European eel at the catchment scale. Model outputs also reinforced previous findings on the impact of barriers to migration and other abiotic and biotic factors on fish species, demonstrating the effectiveness of eDNA sampling in rivers for understanding species distributions at a catchment scale.
C_LIO_LIThis case study provides novel insights into the co-distribution of beavers and migratory fish, and highlights how catchment-wide eDNA monitoring can be applied by environmental managers to aid decision-making and impact assessment more generally.

"Neuropathic pain, a debilitating chronic pain condition, is a major clinical challenge. The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) has been shown to suppress neuropathic pain in rodent models, but its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that intrathecal administration of IL-4 to mice with spinal nerve transection (SpNT) increased the number of CD11c+ microglia (a microglia subset important for pain remission) in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) and that this effect of IL-4 was essential for its ameliorating effect on SpNT-induced pain hypersensitivity. Furthermore, in mice with spared nerve injury (SNI), another model in which pain remission does not occur, the emergence of CD11c+ SDH microglia was curtailed, but intrathecal IL-4 increased their emergence and ameliorated pain hypersensitivity in a CD11c+ microglia-dependent manner. Our study reveals a mechanism by which intrathecal IL-4 ameliorates pain hypersensitivity after nerve injury and provides evidence that IL-4 increases CD11c+ microglia with a function that ameliorates neuropathic pain."
"While the mouse visual system is known to differ substantially from the primate, if the two systems share computational principles, then generalization of results across species may still be possible. One prominent difference is that orientation selectivity is found in mouse superficial superior colliculus (SC), but is not commonly observed in primate SC. Nevertheless, there may be conservation of computational principles if orientation selectivity in mouse superficial SC displays similar properties to primate primary visual cortex (V1), such as invariance to differences in other stimulus dimensions. However, a recent calcium (Ca2+) imaging study revealed a population map for stimulus orientation in mouse superficial SC that changed with stimulus properties such as size, shape and spatial frequency, in apparent contradistinction to computational principles for orientation selectivity in primates. To reconcile mouse and primate mechanisms for orientation selectivity, we constructed computational models of mouse superficial SC populations with fixed, stimulus-invariant receptive fields (RFs) classically used to describe neural RFs in monkey lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and V1. At preferred spatial frequencies, model RFs exhibited stronger responses where the aperture and gratings were differently oriented, while at non-preferred frequencies, orientation selectivity reversed, matching the imaging data. We provide an intuitive explanation by visualizing stimulus-RF interactions in the spatial frequency domain. Intrinsically oriented RFs were unnecessary to explain much of the imaging data, but modeling of single units suggests a possible subpopulation of intrinsically orientation-selective cells. In summary, our population modeling approach provides a parsimonious explanation for stimulus-dependent orientation selectivity consistent with well-established results from sensory neurophysiology. More broadly, we provide a population modeling framework for establishing shared computations across species."
"Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by significant clinical and molecular heterogeneity, influenced by genetic and demographic factors. Using an unbiased, network-driven approach, we analyzed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome from 431 individuals (483 samples), including 111 African American participants, to identify core protein modules associated with AD, race, sex, and age. Our analysis revealed ten co-expression modules linked to distinct biological pathways and cell types, many of which correlated with established AD biomarkers such as {beta}-amyloid, tau, and phosphorylated tau. To further resolve disease heterogeneity, we applied a proteomic subtyping approach, identifying six distinct CSF subtypes spanning the clinical and pathological spectrum. These subtypes were validated across independent cohorts, with many aligning with previously defined AD subtypes, including those linked to neuronal hyperplasticity, immune activation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Notably, the BBB subtype, enriched with African Americans and men, was characterized by low CSF tau, high CSF/serum albumin ratios, and reduced synaptic protein levels. This subtype also exhibited increased levels of proteolytic enzymes, including thrombin and matrix metalloproteases, that cleave tau. Plasma dilution into the neuronal hyperplastic AD subtype CSF led to reduced tau and synaptic protein module levels, indicating that plasma protease activity contributes to tau and synaptic protein depletion independent of underlying brain pathology. These findings highlight the impact of BBB integrity on CSF tau levels, particularly in men and African Americans, and underscore the need for diversity-informed AD biomarker strategies to improve diagnostics and therapeutic targeting across populations."
"Mitochondria are pivotal regulators of cellular homeostasis, integrating energy metabolism, biosynthesis, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). During apoptosis, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by BAX/BAK pores facilitates release of apoptotic factors, while the role of inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) remodelling remains less understood. Here, we identify LACTB, a filament-forming serine protease and tumour suppressor, as a regulator of IMM dynamics during apoptosis. LACTB is required for apoptosis-induced IMM remodelling, which in turn causes increased release of cytochrome c and other mitochondrial apoptotic factors. LACTB-induced membrane remodelling is independent of OPA1 processing. Rather, purified LACTB binds and remodels cardiolipin-enriched membrane nanotubes preferentially over planar lipid membranes, suggesting a direct effect in apoptotic membrane remodelling. Intriguingly, LACTB is not required for mitochondrial shape changes induced by mitochondrial depolarization, suggesting that LACTB action is apoptosis-specific. Collectively, our findings establish LACTB as a mediator of apoptosis-induced IMM remodelling, suggesting a mechanism for tumour suppression in cancer."
"Immunotherapy has emerged as a powerful strategy for combating cancer by harnessing the patient immune system to recognize and eliminate malignant cells. The major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) has a pivotal role in the recognition step. These surface proteins present cancer-specific neoantigens to CD8+ T cells, which triggers activation and T cell-mediated killing. However, cancer cells can often evade immune detection by downregulating MHC-I surface expression, which renders the immune response less effective. In turn, this resistance mechanism offers an opportunity to bolster MHC-I surface expression via therapeutic interventions. Here, we conducted an initial comprehensive evaluation of previously purported small molecule MHC-I inducers and identified heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors as privileged inducers of MHC-I surface expression. With a core scaffold in hand, we employed an in situ click chemistry-based derivatization strategy to generate 380 novel compounds in the same family. New agents from this library showed high levels of induction, with one of the triazole-based analogs, CliMB-325, also enhancing T cell activation and exhibiting lower toxicity, which could potentiate some immunotherapeutic modalities. Moreover, we demonstrated the potential of a click chemistry-based diversification strategy for the discovery of small molecules to counter immune evasion."
"Tumor-adjacent normal tissues (TANTs) histologically and morphologically look normal and are commonly used as a control in patient-based cancer studies. Previous studies have revealed that TANTs present a unique transitional state between healthy normal and tumor tissues. However, there is little or no knowledge about the landscape of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in TANTs and how they differ from the tumor tissues. Here, we integrate the PPI data mapped onto the differentially expressed genes in TANTs and tumor tissues compared to healthy normal tissues to comprehensively construct and analyze the PPI networks of TANTs and breast tumor tissues (viz., Luminal A, Luminal B, Her2, Basal, and Normal-Like). First, these PPI networks were analyzed using network influence and vulnerability analyses from the NetVA R package. Consequently, our study revealed 134 vulnerable proteins (VPs), 21 vulnerable protein pairs (VPPs), and 94 influential proteins (IPs) commonly shared across all six tissue networks. Further, we identified a set of 34 proteins as common hubs and another set of seven proteins as common bottlenecks across all six tissue networks. Next, these VPs, IPs, hubs, and bottlenecks were investigated for their associations with various diseases, including cancers, and found to share a significant number of well-known cancer-associated proteins, viz., AR, BRCA1, ERBB2, FN1, FOXA1, JUN, MKI67, and NRAS. Thus, by applying network vulnerability, influence, and gene-disease association-based analyses, we suggest lists of known and novel candidates along with their associated protein complexes potentially involved in breast cancer tumorigenesis and present across TANTs and different breast cancer subtypes."
"The human cerebral cortex contains localized regions for processing faces. These regions or patches, which are classically found in the occipito-temporal cortex, encode visual properties of faces. Using naturalistic movie-watching fMRI data from 176 human subjects and multivariate functional connectivity analysis, here we comprehensively characterize a novel network of four frontal face patches (FFPs) arranged dorsoventrally in the lateral prefrontal cortex. FFPs are strongly coupled with a face-selective region in the middle superior temporal sulcus, appear to be primarily involved in processing high-level social aspects of faces during movie-watching, and show partial correlations of activity with distinct cognitive networks. Activations in FFPs are correlated with the performance of subjects in a social cognition task. We further identify two groups of subjects who showed a remarkable difference in the topographical organization of FFPs. The discovery of FFPs provides new insights into the understanding of social processing in the brain."
"Task errors are used to learn and refine motor skills. We investigated how task assistance influences learned neural representations using Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), which map neural activity into movement via a decoder. We analyzed motor cortex activity as monkeys practiced BCI with a decoder that adapted to improve or maintain performance over days. Over time, task-relevant information became concentrated in fewer neurons, unlike with fixed decoders. At the population level, task information also became largely confined to a few neural modes that accounted for an unexpectedly small fraction of the population variance. A neural network model suggests the adaptive decoders directly contribute to forming these more compact neural representations. Our findings show that assistive decoders manipulate error information used for long-term learning computations like credit assignment, which informs our understanding of motor learning and has implications for designing real-world BCIs."
"Light exposure during the day exerts acute effects on attention, such as how alert and ready a person is for solving problems and goal-oriented behavior. However, to increase the understanding of how different light conditions during daytime affect our attention, there is a need for more studies. The current study tested the acute effects of daytime exposure to three experimental light conditions and one control light condition on attention and alertness with the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). Healthy, young adults (N = 39; mean age: 21.7, 61.5% females) performed the PVT three times in all four light conditions presented on separate days at the same time-of-day (09:00-11:00): three experimental light conditions of short-wavelength light [SWL, ""blue"", high melanopic illuminance], long-wavelength light [LWL, ""red"", low melanopic illuminance], and bright white light [BWL], and a dim light [DL] condition as control. Attention and alertness measures included fluctuations in attention, quantified as the number of lapses and Reaction Time (RT) variability; mean RT; and optimum response capability (10% fastest RTs). Compared to DL, participants had significantly fewer lapses and faster mean RT during SWL and LWL, and they enhanced their optimum response capability during LWL. There were no significant effects of BWL, and light did not appear to have effects on intra-individual RT variability. Surprisingly, SWL was not superior to LWL, hence, our results suggest that light, irrespective of melanopic illuminance level, has the potential to increase alertness and attention during daytime."
"Non-coding variants in cis-regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers contribute to inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), however, characterizing the functional impact of most regulatory variants remains challenging. To improve identification of variants of interest, we implemented machine learning using a gapped k-mer support vector machine approach trained on single nucleus ATAC-seq data from specific cell classes of the adult and developing human retina. We developed 18 distinct ML models to predict the impact of non-coding variants on 39,437 cell-class-specific regulatory elements. These models demonstrate accuracy over 90% and a high degree of cell class specificity. Variant Impact Prediction (VIP) scores highlight specific sequences within candidate CREs, including putative transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, that are predicted to alter CRE function if mutated. Correlations to massively parallel reporter assays support the predictive value of VIP scores to model single nucleotide variants and indels in a cell-class-specific manner. These analyses demonstrate the capacity for single nucleus epigenomic data to predict the impact of non-coding sequence variants and allow for rapid prioritization of patient variants for further functional analysis."
"The experimental high-throughput screening (HTS) methods, exemplified by CRISPR- based screening techniques, have revolutionized target identification in drug discovery. However, such screens frequently yield extensive, often unrelated target lists necessitating costly and time-intensive experimental evaluation and validation. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-filter strategy that integrates literature-mined targets with CRISPR/Cas9 screening outputs, systematically prioritizing the most credible candidates and thereby reducing the experimental validation burden and increasing success rate. To validate this strategy, we applied it with hand-foot syndrome (HFS), a clinically challenging side effect induced by fluoropyrimidine treatment. We identified ATF4 as a key regulator of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) toxicity in the skin and revealed forskolin as a potential therapeutic agent of HFS through the strategy. Mechanistically, forskolin triggers MEK/ERK-dependent ATF4 induction, subsequently driving 5-FU detoxification via the ATF4-mediated eIF2/I{kappa}B signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrate that this dual-filter strategy could notably accelerate drug discovery by reducing experimental validation burden after target screening."
"SummarySediment DNA--the ability to extract DNA from archaeological sediments-- is an exciting new frontier in ancient DNA research, offering the potential to study individuals at a given archaeological site without destructive sampling. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the promise of this approach by recovering hominin DNA from prehistoric sediments, including those dating back to the Middle or Late Pleistocene. However, a lack of open-source workflows for analysis of hominin sediment DNA samples poses a challenge for data processing and reproducibility of findings across studies. Here we introduce a snakemake workflow, sedimix, for processing genomic sequences from archaeological sediment DNA samples to identify hominin sequences and generate relevant summary statistics to assess the reliability of the pipeline. By performing simulations and comparing to published studies, we show that sedimix has high sensitivity and precision. sedimix offers a reliable and adaptable framework to aid in the analysis of sediment DNA datasets and improve reproducibility across studies.

"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Existing therapeutic options have limited efficacy, particularly for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), underscoring the critical need for the identification of new therapeutic targets. We previously demonstrated that the Transmembrane Serine Protease TMPRSS11B promotes transformation of human bronchial epithelial cells and enhances lactate export from LUSC cells. To determine the impact of TMPRSS11B activity on the host immune system and the tumor microenvironment (TME), we evaluated the effect of Tmprss11b depletion in a syngeneic mouse model. Tmprss11b depletion significantly reduced tumor burden in immunocompetent mice and triggered an infiltration of immune cells. RNA FISH analysis and spatial transcriptomics in the autochthonous Rosa26-Sox2-Ires-GfpLSL/LSL; Nkx2-1fl/fl; Lkb1fl/fl (SNL) model revealed an enrichment of Tmprss11b expression in LUSC tumors, specifically in Krt13+ hillock-like cells. Ultra-pH sensitive nanoparticle imaging and metabolite analysis identified regions of acidification, elevated lactate, and enrichment of M2-like macrophages in LUSC tumors. These results demonstrate that TMPRSS11B promotes an acidified and immunosuppressive TME and nominate this enzyme as a therapeutic target in LUSC."
"Despite decades of research, connecting molecular and cellular phenotypes to complex behavioral traits remains an elusive goal1. Social motivation exhibits individual trait variation2, which we hypothesize is mediated by molecular and cellular variability across hypothalamic neurons. To test this, we generated single-nucleus RNA-sequencing profiles3,4 of >120,000 neurons from tuberal hypothalamus and adjacent thalamus in 36 mice, balanced across sex and autism-associated mutation5, with all mice assessed for social motivation2. First, we show that molecular activation patterns predict behavior across individuals: specifically, activation of paraventricular Agtr1a+ (angiotensin receptor 1a) neurons predicted reduced social behavior. Subsequent inhibition of AGTR1A with telmisartan--an FDA-approved antihypertensive6--improved social orienting. Second, we show natural variation in neuronal proportions--likely arising from stochastic developmental events7--is sufficient to shape adult behavior even among genetically-identical individuals: we identified multiple neuronal populations whose relative abundance predicted social reward-seeking behavior. Chemogenetic inhibition of one such population, Nxph4+ neurons of the postero-lateral hypothalamus8, suppressed multiple aspects of social motivation. This work establishes proof-of-principle for an approach where single-cell genomics precisely maps neural substrates governing behavior. This approach revealed that stochastic variations in neuronal architecture deterministically influence social motivation, and enabled identification of therapeutically-actionable targets with immediate translational potential for disorders with social deficits."
"Alternative splicing (AS) significantly increases the diversity of gene function by enabling a single gene to produce multiple protein isoforms. U1 and U2AF are proteins responsible for the recognition and splicing of an introns donor and acceptor sites, respectively. Here, we used RNA- seq to explore these fundamental splicing events to separately calculate the splicing efficiency of U1 and U2AF. The expression levels of splice sites were directly calculated by the number of uniquely mapped reads spanning the splice junction. We found that the scaled expression levels of donor and acceptor sites both follow a type III extreme value Weibull distribution with the same shape parameter of 0.14. These observations significantly extend our previous findings by revealing that AS follows a Weibull distribution at the levels of both the fundamental splicing event and the mature transcript isoform. A simple transform of the shape parameter a, 1/(1+a), ranges between 0 and 1, and positively correlates with the dominance of the major splicing product and therefore represents an index of the splicing machinery efficiency. Importantly, the equal splicing efficiency of U1 and U2AF ensure that their combined efficacy reaches a maximum."
"Polyamines are essential molecules across all domains of life, but their role as signaling molecules in host-microbe interactions is increasingly recognized. However, because they are produced by both the host and the microbe, their dual origin makes their functional dissection challenging. The plant pathogen Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum GMI1000 secretes large amounts of putrescine both in vitro and in the xylem sap of host plants. In this study, we investigated the genetic changes underlying its experimental evolution into a legume symbiont. We showed that the paeA gene (RSc2277), which was repeatedly mutated during this process, encodes a putrescine exporter. Mutations in paeA completely abolished putrescine excretion in vitro and enhanced bacterial proliferation within nodules during interaction with the legume Mimosa pudica. When these mutations occurred in symbionts already capable of intracellular infection, it further increased bacterial load in nodules and allowed the detection of nitrogenase activity. In addition, paeA-mutated symbionts modulated host gene expression towards a more functional symbiotic state by repressing defense-related genes and inducing nodule development genes. These nodule development genes include genes encoding leghemoglobins and an arginine decarboxylase, a key enzyme in plant putrescine biosynthesis. These results indicate that bacterial and plant putrescine have distinct functions in legume symbiosis and highlight the complex role of polyamines in plant-microbe interactions.

ImportanceRhizobia, the nitrogen-fixing symbionts of legumes, emerged through repeated and independent horizontal transfers of some essential symbiotic genes. However, these transfers alone are often insufficient to convert the recipient bacterium into a functional legume symbiont. In a laboratory experiment, we evolved the plant pathogen Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum into a nodulating and intracellularly infecting symbiont of Mimosa pudica. This transition required genomic modifications in the recipient bacterium to activate its acquired symbiotic potential. Here, we demonstrated that one of these key adaptive modifications is the inactivation of bacterial putrescine export. This polyamine, when produced by the microsymbiont, appears to act as a negative signal for the plant. This study provides new insights into the distinct roles of bacterial- and plant-derived putrescine in plant-microbe interactions, highlighting their functional divergence despite being produced by both organisms."
"Motion direction detection is a fundamental visual computation that transforms spatial luminance patterns into directionally tuned outputs. Classical models of direction selectivity rely on temporal asymmetry, where motion detection arises through either delayed excitation or inhibition. Here, I used biologically inspired machine learning applied to retinal and cortical circuits to uncover multiple novel feedforward architectures capable of direction selectivity.

These include mechanisms based on asymmetric synaptic properties, spatial receptive field variations, new roles for pre- and postsynaptic inhibition, and previously unrecognized kinetic implementations. Conceptually, these circuit architectures cluster into eight computational primitives underlying motion detection, four of which are newly discovered. Many of the solutions rival or outperform classical models in both robustness and precision, and several exhibit enhanced noise tolerance. All mechanisms are biologically plausible and correspond to known physiological and anatomical motifs, offering fresh insights into motion processing and illustrating how machine learning can uncover general principles of neural computation."
"Multisensory processing and learning shape cognitive and language development, influencing how we perceive and interact with the world from an early age. While multisensory processes mature into adolescence, it remains poorly understood how age influences multisensory associative learning. This study investigated age-related effects on multisensory processing and learning during audio-visual and tactile-visual learning in 67 children (5.7-13 years) by integrating behavioural and neuroimaging data with computational methods. A reward-learning drift diffusion model revealed that older children processed information faster and made more efficient decisions on multisensory associations. These age-related increases coincided with higher activity in brain regions associated with cognitive control, multisensory integration, and memory retrieval, specifically during audio-visual learning. Notably, the anterior insula exhibited heightened activation in response to lower reward prediction errors, indicative of increased sensitivity to negative feedback with development. Finally, reward prediction errors and values modulated activation in reward processing and cognitive control regions, with this modulation remaining modality-independent and largely stable across age. In conclusion, while children employ similar learning strategies, older children make decisions more efficiently and engage neural resources more strongly. Our findings reflect ongoing maturation of neural networks supporting multisensory learning in middle childhood, enabling more adaptive learning in later childhood.

Highlights- faster information processing in older children during a multisensory learning task
- increasing brain activation with age in visual, parietal, and frontal regions
- learning rate related to middle frontal and anterior cingulate cortex activity
- value and reward prediction error processing are independent of age and modality
- heightened response to negative reward prediction errors with increasing age"
"Swine infections with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App), the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, lead to significant production losses. Surviving pigs may harbor antibiotic-resistant bacteria, highlighting the need for alternatives to reduce antimicrobial use. Stimulation of respiratory innate immunity via Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) agonists such as FLAMOD (a recombinant flagellin), has emerged as a promising strategy for combating bacterial lung infections. In a recent study, aerosolized administration of FLAMOD was found to elicit respiratory immune responses in pigs. This study assessed FLAMODs protective effects against App, either as a prophylactic intervention or as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy. Prophylactic administration of aerosolized FLAMOD via nebulization before App challenge failed to confer protection. However, in a therapeutic setting, where pigs were infected with App and treated with either a subtherapeutic dose of penicillin G (PenG) alone or a combination of PenG and aerosolized FLAMOD. Notably, the FLAMOD and PenG combination significantly improved bacterial clearance from the lungs. Moreover, FLAMOD-PenG treated pigs exhibited a trend toward increased weight gain and fewer lung lesions compared to those receiving PenG alone. These findings provide proof for the concept that FLAMOD enhances antibiotic efficacy, potentially lowering the required antibiotic dose and contributing to antimicrobial resistance mitigation in pigs."
"Muller cells are the most abundant glial cell type in the human and mouse retina, playing a crucial role in maintaining retinal homeostasis. However, many aspects of Muller cell function remain poorly characterized. In this study, we reanalyzed a single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset from Aire-/- mice, focusing on Muller cells and T cells. We identified nine distinct Muller cell subgroups and five T cell subgroups, with activated Muller cells comprising the majority of the Muller cells in the inflamed retina. Using SCassist, an AI-based workflow assistant for single-cell analysis, we created a comparison matrix to quantify pathway involvement in each Muller cell subset. This approach unveils the functional dynamics of Muller cells during retinal inflammation. Activated Muller cells primarily exhibit enhanced inflammatory activity and adopt a macrophage or dendritic-cell-like phenotype, in the presence or absence of increased neuronal activity. These changes are primarily driven by Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs), acting alone or in concert with Neuronal Differentiation 1 (NEUROD1). We further inferred the interactions between Muller cells and T cells and found that activated Muller cells do not appear to exhibit extra chemoattraction to Th1 cells compared to other Muller cell subsets, but they do show such effects on the Th1-like regulatory T cells (Tregs). Activated Muller cells display nearly exclusive expression of immune checkpoint molecules, primarily targeting Th1 cells. These findings may uncover a previously unrecognized role for activated Muller cells in attenuating Th1 cell activity."
"Since 2020, large-scale outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in Great Britain have resulted in substantial poultry mortality and economic losses. Alongside the costs, the risk of circulation leading to a viral reassortment that causes zoonotic spillover raises additional concerns. However, the precise mechanisms driving transmission between poultry premises and the impact of potential control measures in Great Britain, such as vaccination, are not fully understood. We have developed a spatial transmission model for the spread of HPAI in poultry premises calibrated to infected premises data for the 2022-23 season using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Our results indicate that enhanced biosecurity measures and/or vaccination of the premises surrounding an identified infected premises can substantially reduce the overall number of infected premises. Our findings highlight that enhanced control measures could limit the future impact of HPAI on the poultry industry and reduce the risk of broader health threats."
"Solenopsis invicta, commonly known as the fire ant, is characterized by aggressive behavior and exceptional invasive capabilities, rendering conventional control methods largely ineffective. Here, we explore the implementation of homing suppression gene drive in fire ants by developing a spatially explicit model that incorporates both monogyne and polygyne colony structures, enabling comprehensive evaluation of genetic control strategies. Ants may present unique challenges for gene drive due to their colony structure and haplodiploidy. Our results reveal that after an extended period of time, gene drive effectively eliminates polygyne colonies, but monogyne populations often persist at low level. Though standard suppression drives in haplodiploids have reduced power, new dominant-sterile resistance or two-target strategies, as well as drives that affect the colony structure, can restore high suppressive capability. Interspecific competition can also exert a positive effect on gene drive-mediated population suppression dynamics. In particular, a gene drive release during the invasion phase significantly enhances population suppression, enabling native ants to successfully recolonize their original habitats. We also identify several conserved female fertility genes in fire ants, together with gRNA targets that may support efficient, low-resistance suppression drive designs. Overall, we conclude that while gene drive in fire ants may take place over extended time scales, its long-term results, even with imperfect efficiency, are quite promising."
"Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) relies on association with PP1-interacting proteins (PIPs) to generate substrate-specific PIP/PP1 holoenzymes, but the lack of well-defined substrates has hindered elucidation of the mechanisms involved. We previously demonstrated that the Phactr1 PIP confers sequence specificity on the Phactr1/PP1 holoenzyme by remodelling the PP1 hydrophobic substrate groove. Phactr1 defines a group of ""RVxF-{Phi}{Phi}-R-W"" PIPs that all interact with PP1 in a similar fashion. Here we use a PP1-PIP fusion approach to address sequence specificity and identify substrates of the RVxF-{Phi}{Phi}-R-W family PIPs. We show that the four Phactr proteins confer identical sequence specificities on their holoenzymes. We identify the 4E-BP and p70 S6K translational regulators as substrates for the Neurabin/Spinophilin PIPs, implicated in neuronal plasticity, pointing to a role for their holoenzymes in mTORC1-dependent translational control. Biochemical and structural experiments show that in contrast to the Phactrs, substrate recruitment and catalytic efficiency of the PP1-Neurabin and PP1-Spinophilin fusions is primarily determined by substrate interaction with the PDZ domain adjoining their RVxF-{Phi}{Phi}-R-W motifs, rather than by recognition of the remodelled PP1 hydrophobic groove. Thus, even PIPs that interact with PP1 in a similar manner use different mechanisms to ensure substrate selectivity."
"Using single-molecule experiments, ensemble assays, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we showed that collagen actively influences MMP1 interdomain dynamics. This paper extends the previous experimental work to validate MD simulations and gain more insights into MMP1-collagen interactions. We include virtual screening with free energy calculations to uncover key insights regarding substrate-dependent dynamics, allostery, and ligand binding. Our findings reveal that MMP1 interdomain dynamics are influenced by the strain in collagen, and collagen-specific allosteric residues exhibit strong correlations with the active site. Additionally, allosteric paths connecting these residues to the active site bypass the linker region. Collagen also induces changes in the configurations of the catalytic motif. Furthermore, MD simulation and virtual screening identify molecules that bind to allosteric residues, alter MMP1 dynamics, and potentially change activity. Free energy calculations highlight the essential role of the substrate in small molecule screening against a protein. We have developed a comprehensive framework for identifying substrate-specific allosteric residues in MMP1 and screening small molecules incorporating protein dynamics in the presence of substrates. These results significantly impact our understanding of MMP1 interactions with collagen fibrils and pave the way for selectively modulating specific MMP1 functions without altering its other functions in future applications.

SignificanceIn this paper, we validated all-atom simulations of free and collagen-bound MMP1 and gained insights into MMP1 function. We have found that collagen changes dynamics, allostery, and ligand binding in MMP1. Collagen strain, known to be age-dependent, also changes MMP1 dynamics and ligand binding. Interdomain allosteric paths do not go through the linker connecting the MMP1 domains. Instead, paths from the collagen-specific allosteric residue to the active site have non-bonded interactions. Screening of small molecules against collagen-specific MMP1 residue suggests that collagen alters ligand binding to MMP1. These results will significantly impact understanding MMPs and small molecule screening against proteins. Substrate-specific allosteric residues may enable controlling one function of MMPs without altering their other functions, leading to fewer side effects."
"Polypharmacy side effects occur when drug combinations trigger unexpected interactions, altering therapeutic outcomes. During which the activity of one drug may change favorably or unfavorably if taken with the other drug. Drug interactions are rare and are only observed in clinical studies. Thus, the discovery and detection of polypharmacy side effects remains a challenge. Our approach achieves an impressive average F1 score of 0.93, demonstrating its efficacy in capturing drug interaction patterns.

"Chemical dimerizers are synthetic molecules that bring into proximity two or more proteins that do not normally interact with one another. A major application of this technology is to recruit an enzyme to a target protein, resulting in its post-translational modification (PTM). In particular, chemical dimerizer-mediated poly-Ubiquitylation of proteins has garnered an enormous amount of interest as a new drug modality. A fundamental requirement for the construction of new PTM-driving dimerizers is an enzyme ligand that does not inhibit its activity. Traditional activity-based high-throughput screening platforms are not suited for this purpose. Here we describe a novel platform for screening libraries of bead-displayed compounds that links a requirement for small molecule binding to the enzyme with enzyme-mediated modification of a nearby substrate. This system ensures that the enzyme-recruiting small molecules do not interfere with the catalytic function of the enzyme. We demonstrate the utility of this system in the context of E3 Ubiquitin ligase-recruiting molecules and report the discovery of a novel, low molecular mass ligand for the Von Hippel Landau (VHL) protein."
"Mitochondrial (mt)ROS, insufficient NAD+, and cellular senescence all contribute to the decrease in bone formation with aging. ROS can cause senescence and decrease NAD+, but it remains unknown whether these mechanisms mediate the effects of ROS in vivo. Here, we generated mice lacking the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme Sod2 in osteoblast lineage cells targeted by Osx1-Cre and showed that Sod2{Delta}Osx1 mice had low bone mass. Osteoblastic cells from these mice had impaired mitochondrial respiration and attenuated NAD+ levels. Administration of an NAD+ precursor improved mitochondrial function in vitro but failed to rescue the low bone mass of Sod2{Delta}Osx1 mice. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of bone mesenchymal cells indicated that ROS had no significant effects on markers of senescence but disrupted parathyroid hormone signaling, iron metabolism, and proteostasis. Our data supports the rationale that treatment combinations aimed at decreasing mtROS and senescent cells and increasing NAD+ should confer additive effects in delaying age-associated osteoporosis."
"Large-scale transcriptomic studies are often limited by data silos and risks of privacy leakage, which may lead to missed clinical insights. Meta-analysis methods may be used to aggregate local results, but they induce lower statistical power and are particularly sensitive to heterogeneous settings. A recent paradigm in distributed computing, federated learning (FL) is a means of fitting models from siloed data, while ensuring that private data does not leave its storage facilities. Here, we introduce FedPyDESeq2, a software for differential expression analysis (DEA) on siloed bulk RNA-seq. Building on FL tools, FedPyDESeq2 implements the DESeq2 pipeline for DEA on siloed datasets in a privacy-enhancing manner. We benchmark FedPyDESeq2 on datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas corresponding to 8 different indications, split by geographical origin. FedPyDESeq2 achieves near-identical results on siloed data compared with PyDESeq2 on pooled data, and significantly outperforms meta-analysis baselines."
"BackgroundInfection with enteric bacterial pathogens continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality throughout the world. These pathogens include enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, which transit the intestinal tract, efface microvilli, and attach firmly to intestinal epithelial cells predominantly in the colon. Investigation of these human-adapted pathogens has been greatly aided by mouse models of infection. The mouse-adapted attaching and effacing pathogen Citrobacter rodentium utilizes many similar mechanisms of pathogenesis, including the use of a type III secretion system, and virulence factors encoded in a locus of enterocyte effacement. Although this model has allowed for assessing the complexity of the host response, the complex interplay between the nervous and immune systems in response to infection remains incomplete.

MethodsWe assessed the role of sensory neurotransmitters encoded by the Tac1 gene in the host response to C. rodentium.

ResultsTac1-deficient mice had significantly reduced pathogen shedding and colonic bacterial burden, accompanied by decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In accordance with reduced chemokine production, we observed reduced colonic recruitment of specific immune cell populations in Tac1-/- compared to WT mice.

ConclusionsSensory neuropeptides regulate key aspects of enteric bacterial infection and may serve as unique targets in the treatment of enteric disease."
"Motion processing is a key function for the survival of many organisms and is initially implemented in the primary visual cortex (V1) and the middle temporal area (V5/MT) of the primate visual cortex. Advances in machine learning approaches have led to the development of motion processing neural networks that have elucidated several aspects of this process. However, it remains unclear how adaptation, a canonical function of sensory processing, influences motion processing. In this study, we developed two recurrent neural networks to study motion processing: MotionNet-R, a baseline model, and AdaptNet, a model that employs adaptive mechanisms inspired by biological systems. Both networks were trained on natural image sequences to estimate motion vectors. We found that both networks developed response properties that resembled those of neurons found in areas V1 and MT, e.g., speed tuning, and AdaptNet recapitulated the motion aftereffect phenomenon (i.e., the waterfall illusion). We show that the emergent computational properties that implement the phenomenon in AdaptNet confirm previous theoretical hypotheses. Further, we compared the performance of the two networks and found that AdaptNet processed motion more efficiently, operationalized as reduced activation. While AdaptNet incurred reduced accuracy in response to prolonged constant input, it was both more accurate and sensitive in response to changes in motion input. These results are consistent with theoretical explanations of adaptation as neural property that supports metabolic efficiency and increased sensitivity to change in the environment. Our findings provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying motion adaptation and highlight the potential advantages of adaptive neural networks in modelling biological processes."
"Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism contributes prominently to the TCA cycle in the healthy pancreas but is suppressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). The impact of this metabolic remodeling on cancer phenotypes remains poorly understood. Here, we find that the BCAA isoleucine is a primary source of propionyl-CoA in PDA cells. Reduction of propionyl-CoA availability by either genetic perturbation or isoleucine and valine starvation decreases histone propionylation (Kpr) without impacting histone acetylation on specific lysine sites, correlating with reduced transcription of certain lipid- and immune-related genes. Mechanistically, we find that multiple enzymes of isoleucine catabolism unexpectedly localize to and carry out multi-step isoleucine oxidation within the nuclei of PDA cells. Importantly, nuclear localization of the rate-limiting branched-chain alpha ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex is essential for isoleucine-dependent Kpr and gene regulation. Moreover, we demonstrate that isoleucine-sensitive Kpr and its associated gene expression are driven by the MYST family of lysine acyltransferases (KATs), and that the BCKDHA subunit of the BCKDH complex interacts with KAT7 within the nuclear compartment. BCAA catabolism enzymes are apparent in the nuclei of PanIN lesions in mice and PDA tumors in patients, contrasting that in healthy pancreatic acinar and ductal cells. Collectively, these findings unveil a nuclear isoleucine catabolism pathway and highlight its role in controlling histone Kpr and tumorigenic transcriptional programs in PDA."
"Legionella pneumophila is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that causes Legionnaires disease. To establish an intracellular niche conducive to replication, L. pneumophila translocates a diverse array of effector proteins that manipulate various host cellular processes, including the actin cytoskeleton. In a screen for effectors that alter actin dynamics, we identified a Legionella effector, Lfat1, which colocalizes with the actin cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. Lfat1 specifically binds F-actin through a novel actin-binding domain (ABD). High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) analysis revealed that this ABD forms a long -helix hairpin, with its tip interacting with subdomains I and II of two adjacent actin molecules within the F-actin filament. Interestingly, while individual -helices of the hairpin fail to bind F-actin, co-expression as separate fusion proteins restores binding activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Lfat1 exhibits lysine fatty-acyltransferase (KFAT) activity, targeting host small GTPases. These findings establish a foundation for studying the KFAT family of bacterial toxins and uncover a novel F-actin binding motif, providing an alternative F-actin marker with notable flexibility."
"BackgroundThe myogenic fusion index (FI) is commonly used in skeletal muscle cell culture to assess the ability of myoblasts to form myotubes, as the ratio of myoblast nuclei fused with myotubes over the total number of myoblasts. The manual quantification of the FI from 2D microscopy images is tedious and biased, thus several automated methods have been developed. However, they still face challenges such as efficient nucleus segmentation and classification of fused and isolated myoblast nuclei. Here, we developed a novel workflow entirely based on AI for fully automated and unbiased quantification of the FI.

ResultsUsing current methods, we show that myoblast nuclei located above or below myotubes can significantly corrupt accurate FI computation. To circumvent this issue, we developed MyoFuse which enables an accurate and high-throughput segmentation and classification of myonuclei. It comprises a nuclei segmentation step using Cellpose, followed by a classification network trained with Svetlana. MyoFuse demonstrated strong accuracy when tested against manual annotation in mouse C2C12 and human primary myotubes. The trained classifier is able to differentiate myotube nuclei from myoblast nuclei based on myotube cytoplasm staining only. Experimental comparisons also highlighted that the previously developed methods lead to a significant overestimation of the FI.

ConclusionIn summary, we underscore the lack of accuracy of traditional methods for automated FI quantification. MyoFuse enables a direct and accurate segmentation of nuclei even in nuclei clusters frequently observed in myotubes. This workflow thus offers a new and more reliable method to evaluate the FI. It also limits the selection bias by processing large images."
"The DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3X has important roles in development and disease. Loss of DDX3X during developmental and pathological processes such as tumorigenesis can lead to compensatory upregulation of the close paralog DDX3Y in males, which may underlie the sexual dimorphism displayed by some DDX3X-associated diseases. However, how DDX3X cross-regulates DDX3Y remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the regulation of DDX3Y by DDX3X in two male-derived human cancer cell lines, HCT116 and U87MG. Depletion of DDX3X in HCT116 cells results in moderately increased DDX3Y mRNA and protein, in part due to stabilization of DDX3Y transcripts. Conversely, reduction of DDX3X in U87MG cells markedly upregulates DDX3Y protein without affecting its mRNA, mainly by enhancing DDX3Y protein stability. We further show that DDX3X physically interacts with DDX3Y. DDX3Y is much less stable than DDX3X in U87MG cells, and substitution of two lysine residues in DDX3Y with the corresponding arginine in DDX3X stabilizes DDX3Y. Thus, the compensatory upregulation of DDX3Y following DDX3X loss can occur at either transcript or protein level, suggesting complex and cell type-specific cross-regulation between these X- and Y-linked paralogs to keep the total DDX3 dosage in check."
"Background and AimsVery early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) is a clinically distinct form of IBD manifesting in children before the age of six years. Disease in these children is especially severe and often refractory to treatment. While previous studies have investigated changes in the fecal microbiome and metabolome in adult and pediatric IBD, insights in VEO-IBD remain limited. This multi-omics analysis reveals changes in the fecal microbiome and metabolome in VEO-IBD compared with healthy controls.

MethodsFecal samples were collected from children diagnosed with VEO-IBD and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Both the fecal metabolome and microbiome were profiled in each sample, using untargeted liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.

ResultsFecal microbial and metabolic profiles in VEO-IBD were significantly different from healthy controls. Untargeted metabolomics analysis identified a depletion of short-chain N-acyl lipids and an enrichment of dipeptides, tripeptides, and oxo bile acids in VEO-IBD patients. Differential abundance analysis of the gut microbiome showed lower abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium and Blautia, and higher abundance of Lachnospira, Veillonella, and Bacteroides in VEO-IBD. The joint analysis suggested a clear association between the altered gut microbiome composition and metabolic dysregulation, specifically for the N-acyl lipids.

ConclusionsThis study offers unique insight into fecal microbial and metabolic signatures in VEO-IBD, paving the way for a better understanding of disease patterns and thereby more effective treatment strategies."
"Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) enable the selective and sub-stoichiometric elimination of pathological proteins, yet only two E3 ligases are routinely used for this purpose. Here, we expand the repertoire of PROTAC compatible E3 ligases by identifying a novel small molecule scaffold targeting the ubiquitin E3 ligase KLHDC2 using a fluorescence polarization-based high throughput screen. We highlight the utility of this ligand with the synthesis of PROTACs capable of potently degrading BRD4 in cells. This work affords additional chemical matter for targeting KLHDC2 and suggests a practical approach for identifying novel E3 binders by high throughput screening."
"Inferring brain connectivity from inter-individual correlations has been applied across various neuroimaging modalities, including positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI. The variability underlying these inter-individual correlations is generally attributed to factors such as genetics, life experiences, and long-term influences like aging. This study leveraged two unique longitudinal datasets to examine intra-individual correlations of structural and functional brain measures across an extended time span. By focusing on intra-individual correlations, we aimed to minimize individual differences and investigate how aging and state-like effects contribute to brain connectivity patterns. Additionally, we compared intra-individual correlations with inter-individual correlations to better understand their relationship. In the first dataset, which included repeated scans from a single individual over 15 years, we found that intra-individual correlations in both regional homogeneity (ReHo) during resting-state and gray matter volumes (GMV) from structural MRI closely resembled resting-state functional connectivity. However, ReHo correlations were primarily driven by state-like variability, whereas GMV correlations were mainly influenced by aging. The second dataset, comprising multiple participants with longitudinal Fludeoxyglucose (18F) FDG-PET and MRI scans, replicated these findings. Both intra- and inter-individual correlations were strongly associated with resting-state functional connectivity, with functional measures (i.e., ReHo and FDG-PET) exhibiting greater similarity to resting-state connectivity than structural measures. This study demonstrated that controlling for various factors can enhance the interpretability of brain correlation structures. While inter- and intra-individual correlation patterns showed similarities, accounting for additional variables may improve our understanding of inter-individual connectivity measures."
"Larvae of the ascidian Ciona initiate metamorphosis tens of minutes after adhesion to a substratum via their adhesive organ. The gap between adhesion and metamorphosis initiation is suggested to ensure the rigidity of adhesion, allowing Ciona to maintain settlement after losing locomotive activity through metamorphosis. The mechanism producing the gap is unknown. Here, by combining gene functional analyses, pharmacological analyses, and live imaging, we propose that the gap represents the time required for sufficient cAMP accumulation to trigger metamorphosis. Not only the Gs pathway but also the Gi and Gq pathways are involved in the initiation of metamorphosis in the downstream signaling cascade of the neurotransmitter GABA, the known initiator of Ciona metamorphosis. The mutual crosstalk of stimulatory and inhibitory G-proteins functions as the accelerator and brake for cAMP production, ensuring the faithful initiation of metamorphosis at an appropriate time and in the right situation."
"Sulfate minerals are abundant on the Martian surface, and many of these evaporite deposits are thought to have precipitated from acidic fluids. On Earth, gypsum (CaSO4*2H2O) and other sulfates sometimes form under acidic conditions, so exploring the extremophilic life that occurs in these mineral environments can help us evaluate the astrobiological potential of acid sulfate depositional settings. Here, we characterized the microbial communities associated with acidic gypsum deposits in a sulfuric acid cave, where sulfate precipitation is driven by sulfide-oxidizing bacteria and archaea. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing and cell counts to characterize gypsum-associated microorganisms in freshly formed and relict deposits throughout the cave, in order to test hypotheses about how microbial community composition and abundance would vary with distance from the sulfidic water table and with the concentration of H2S(g) and other gases in the cave atmosphere. We found that actively-forming gypsum in the lower cave levels was colonized by low diversity communities of sulfide-oxidizing chemolithotrophs and other acidophiles that have few cells compared to other environments in the cave. The most abundant taxa were Acidithiobacillus, Metallibacterium, Mycobacteria, and three different Thermoplasmatales-group archaea, which occupied distinct niches based on proximity to sulfidic streams and the concentration of gases in the cave air. In contrast, deposits in older cave levels had more diverse communities that are dominated by chemoorganotrophic and methanotrophic taxa. These findings show that acidic sulfate deposits serve as habitats for extremophilic microorganisms, and broaden our knowledge of the life associated with terrestrial sulfates.

ImportanceGypsum and other sulfate salts are common on Mars, and many of these deposits are thought to have formed from acidic fluids early in the planets history. Understanding the life that survives and thrives in similar environments on Earth is therefore crucial for evaluating whether these Martian sulfates are or ever were habitable. One such environment where acidic gypsum occurs is in sulfuric acid caves, where extremophilic microorganisms drive the precipitation of sulfate minerals by oxidizing hydrogen sulfide gas from the cave atmosphere. Here, we characterized the communities of microorganisms on freshly formed and ancient gypsum in the Frasassi Caves, and found that the gypsum deposits hosted microbial communities that changed based on chemical energy availability and the age of the gypsum. Our findings underscore the importance of chemical and microbiological interactions in shaping habitable niches, and provide context for searching for past or present life in acidic Martian sulfates."
"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent inflammatory skin disease with complex pathogenesis. Both skin and gut microbiota influence AD, with Staphylococcus aureus, in particular, exacerbating the disease. However, the relationship between S. aureus colonization in the gut and skin, and whether it affects AD, remains unclear. Using a combination of culture-based methods, microbiome analysis, and genome sequencing of S. aureus from multiple body sites of children with and without AD, we found that the gut represents a major reservoir of genetically diverse S. aureus that is transmitted to the skin, including mutants associated with worse disease. We validated this association between S. aureus gastrointestinal colonization and AD in an independent human cohort and demonstrated its direct effect on disease in an infantile AD mouse model, wherein S. aureus gastrointestinal colonization worsened skin inflammation. Overall, this study identifies a previously unrecognized S. aureus reservoir, with implications for microbiota-targeting therapies in AD."
"Monte Carlo simulation of MRI signals is a powerful tool for modelling and quantifying tissue microstructure. While these methods have been used in MRI for decades, they typically focus on one aspect of microstructure and one type of MRI contrast at a time. In this paper, we present a new Monte Carlo MRI (MCMR) simulator for investigating the impact of tissue microstructure on arbitrary MRI sequences. A key feature of the proposed simulator is that substrates can incorporate multiple microstructural features (diffusion, T1/T2 relaxation, membrane permeability, local off-resonance fields, surface relaxation and magnetisation transfer) simultaneously. This provides a single forward model from tissue microstructure to MRI signals that captures a broad range of contrasts typically considered to be of different MRI ""modalities"". We validate the results of the simulator by reproducing previous findings in well-established sequences, namely diffusion-weighted MRI, magnetisation transfer imaging, and gradient and spin echo sequences. The simulator is fully open source and packaged along with detailed documentation and tutorials."
"Hereditary dystonia, particularly the isolated form of early onset, is often caused by a deletion of the GAG in the TOR1A gene, leading to a dysfunctional TorsinA protein and severe motor impairments. In this study, we investigate an AI-enhanced CRISPR prime editing framework designed for the precise correction of the TOR1A mutation. Our framework integrates the generation of candidate pegRNA with an empirical simulation of training data, enabling the tuning of a random forest model that predicts editing efficiency. This approach generates robust quantitative outputs (validation R2 score of 0.701). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that GC content (mean SHAP = 0.22) and off-target risk (mean SHAP = 0.18) were the strongest drivers of predicted efficiency. The GC content showed strong positive correlations with melting temperature (r = 0.75) and guide efficiency (r = 0.82). By linking the simulated modeling work to the practical challenges of genetic neurosurgery in dystonia, a proof-of-concept framework is presented that is both ethically governed and clinically pertinent. This work looks toward a future of scalpel-less surgery by laying a foundation for future integration with empirical datasets and more advanced deep learning techniques."
"Herbarium specimens are broadly distributed in space and time, enabling investigation of climate impacts on phenology and fitness. We reconstructed specimen ""lived"" climate from knowledge of germination cues and collection dates for 14 annual species in the Streptanthus (s.l.) clade (Brassicaceae) to ask: Which climate attributes, including the timing of precipitation onset, best explain specimen phenological stage and estimated reproduction? We also asked whether climate effects on phenology and reproduction were evolutionarily conserved.

Precipitation amount and onset date, more than temperature, best predicted specimen phenology, but only weakly predicted reproduction. Earlier rainfall onset was associated with more phenologically advanced specimens, a relationship that showed phylogenetic signal. Few climate predictors explained variation in specimen reproduction. The lack of association between specimen reproduction and climate may arise from phenological shifts that buffer impacts of climate, interactions with other species, or challenges in estimating total reproduction from specimens.

Our results highlight the value of specimen-tailored growing season conditions for reconstructing climate, incorporating evolutionary relationships in assessing responses to climate, and the complexities of estimating fitness from specimens. For the latter, we propose supplemental herbarium collections and community science protocols to increase the utility of these data for understanding climate impacts on populations."
"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a crucial role in various biological processes, and understanding these interactions is essential for advancing biomedical research. Automated extraction and analysis of PPI information from the rapidly growing scientific literature remains an important challenge. We present a novel ontology-based approach to analyze protein-protein interactions using Large Language Models (LLMs). We applied different learning strategies, namely in-context learning and parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning for the Llama-2 chat models, to identify keywords in the text that indicate an interaction between a pair of proteins. Our results show that parameter-efficient fine-tuning leads to a performance gain even when the domain is new. The smaller fine-tuned models outperformed the zero-shot performance of much larger models. The keywords identified by the Llama-2 models were mapped to the ontology terms in the Interaction Network Ontology (INO). Our study suggests that a pipeline of an LLM and an ontology is an effective strategy for explaining relations between biomedical entities. This work demonstrates the potential of leveraging ontologies and advanced language models to advance automated PPI analysis from the scientific literature."
"To maintain normal blood glucose levels, pancreatic beta cells secrete insulin into the bloodstream at specialized regions at the cell periphery, often called secretion hot spots. While many secretory machinery components are located all over the cell membrane, directed secretion relies on distinct cortical patches of the scaffolding protein ELKS and the microtubule (MT)-anchoring protein LL5{beta}. However, using TIRF microscopy of intact mouse islets to precisely localize secretion events within ELKS/LL5{beta} patches, we now show that secretion is restricted to only 5% of ELKS/LL5{beta} patch area. Moreover, the majority of secretion occurs at the margins of ELKS patches. This suggests that additional factor(s) must be responsible for hot spot definition. Because the MT cytoskeleton plays a regulatory role in the insulin secretion process via both delivery and removal of secretory granules from the secretion sites, we test whether local MT organization defines secretory activity at hot spots. We find that the majority of secretion events occur at regions devoid of MTs. Based on our findings, we present a model in which local MT disassembly and optimal ELKS content are strong predictors of directed insulin secretion.

Significance StatementO_LIInsulin has to be secreted directly into the bloodstream for efficient regulation of glucose metabolism. Molecular requirements for precise secretion location and microtubule-mediated regulation in directed secretion are uncharacterized.
C_LIO_LIUsing intact mouse islets and a live insulin secretion assay, we demonstrate that cortical patches containing ELKS and LL5{beta} display secretory heterogeneity and secretion hot spots are precisely localized to patch edges that are devoid of microtubules.
C_LIO_LIThese findings suggest that microtubule absence is critical for secretion and secretion occurs away from presumed sites of secretory granule delivery. This expands the current knowledge of regulation and spatial characteristics of insulin secretion.

"Cortical populations are in a broadly asynchronous state that is sporadically interrupted by brief epochs of coordinated population activity. Cortical models are at a loss to explain this combination of states. At one extreme are network models where recurrent inhibition dynamically stabilizes an asynchronous low activity state. While these networks are widely used, they cannot produce the coherent population-wide activity that is reported in a variety of datasets. At the other extreme are models in which strong recurrent excitation that is quickly tamed by short term synaptic depression between excitatory neurons leads to short epochs of population- wide activity. However, in these networks, inhibition plays only a perfunctory role in network stability, which is at odds with many reports across cortex. In this study we analyze spontaneously active in vitro preparations of primary auditory cortex that show dynamics that are emblematic of this mixture of states. To capture this complex population activity we use firing rate-based networks as well as biologically realistic networks of spiking neuron models where large excitation is balanced by recurrent inhibition, yet we include short-term synaptic depression dynamics of the excitatory connections. These models give very rich nonlinear behavior that mimics the core features of the in vitro data, including the possibility of low frequency (2-12 Hz) rhythmic dynamics within population events. In these networks, synaptic depression enables activity fluctuations to induce a weakening of inhibitory recruitment, which in turn triggers population events. In sum, our study extends balanced network models to account for nonlinear, population-wide correlated activity, thereby providing a critical step in a mechanistic theory of realistic cortical activity."
"The noradrenergic locus coeruleus and its neuromodulatory cortical projections are critical for adaptive behavior, yet their contributions to implicit learning in novel environments remain incompletely understood, due to challenges in non-invasive assessment. Here, we combined multimodal neuroimaging--including locus-coeruleus-sensitive structural MRI, concurrent pupillometry-fMRI, and PET-derived noradrenergic transporter maps--with repeated behavioral assessments to investigate noradrenergic contributions to implicit learning across younger and older adults (n = 77).

Salient expectation-violating stimuli elicited pupil dilation, indicating enhanced neuromodulation, activated the action-mode network and deactivated the default-mode network. Pupil-linked BOLD responses suggested a functional coupling between the locus coeruleus and action-mode network, further supported by spatial overlap of activation patterns with PET-derived noradrenergic transporter maps. Locus coeruleus MRI-guided functional connectivity analyses demonstrated that locus coeruleus activity is coupled to anterior insula activation, suggesting a noradrenergic role in shifting cortical dynamics toward action-oriented processing.

Behaviorally, participants implicitly learned the statistical task structure over time, as evidenced by reaction time adjustments based on stimulus probabilities. Critically, stronger locus coeruleus integrity, greater task-related anterior insula activation, and more pronounced pupil dilation were associated with enhanced implicit learning, highlighting the behavioral relevance of noradrenergic neuromodulation. Notably, noradrenergic responses and their link to learning were preserved across age groups, suggesting a robust noradrenergic role in supporting adaptive behavior throughout adulthood.

These findings provide novel insights into the neuromodulatory mechanisms underlying learning and cognitive flexibility, emphasizing the pivotal role of locus coeruleus- action-mode network interactions in behavioral adaptation."
"GCaMP-based calcium imaging is a powerful tool for investigating neural function in specific neurons. We generated transgenic (Tg) medaka strains expressing jGCaMP7s across extensive brain regions under the control of the gap43 promoter. Using these Tg larvae, calcium imaging successfully detected a tricaine-induced suppression of spontaneous neural activity and topographical visual responses in the optic tectum elicited by moving paramecia or optical fiber stimulation. These results indicate that our Tg medaka strains provide a versatile platform for investigating neural dynamics and their responses to various stimuli."
"The creation of a microvilli-rich apical luminal domain is a key event in the development of epithelial tissues. De novo lumenogenesis, in which epithelial cells establish apical identity by directing apical cargo to an apical membrane initiation site (AMIS), has been studied extensively. However, the mechanisms that govern the formation of the AMIS and its progression into a luminal precursor remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed super-resolution imaging, light and electron microscopy, and time-resolved proximity proteomics to explore the spatial, temporal, and molecular processes involved in apical lumen initiation in MDCK-II cells. Interestingly, we discovered that, in both 2D and 3D cultures, the formation of the apical cell cortex begins with the fusion of large intracellular apical precursor organelles called vacuolar apical compartments (VACs) at developing cell junctions. Time-resolved proteomics and high-resolution imaging indicate that the exocytosis of VACs and lumen initiation is temporally coordinated with the formation and maturation of the apical junctional complex. Furthermore, we report that loss of the Crumbs complex proteins Pals1 or PatJ perturbs the organisation of the apical cell cortex and impedes VAC exocytosis at the AMIS, resulting in severe defects in lumen morphogenesis. Overall, our findings define a temporally resolved protein network for de novo cell polarization and highlight Pals1/PatJ as key regulators of apical domain initiation. We further propose that VACs represent a previously unrecognized apical transport carrier that plays a crucial role in the rapid establishment of apical domain identity."
"Most genetic risk variants linked to ocular diseases are non-protein coding and presumably contribute to disease through dysregulation of gene expression, however, deeper understanding of their mechanisms of action has been impeded by an incomplete annotation of the transcriptional regulatory elements across different retinal cell types. To address this knowledge gap, we carried out single-cell multiomics assays to investigate gene expression, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylome and 3D chromatin architecture in human retina, macula, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid. We identified 420,824 unique candidate regulatory elements and characterized their chromatin states in 23 sub-classes of retinal cells. Comparative analysis of chromatin landscapes between human and mouse retina cells further revealed both evolutionarily conserved and divergent retinal gene-regulatory programs. Leveraging the rapid advancements in deep-learning techniques, we developed sequence-based predictors to interpret non-coding risk variants of retina diseases. Our study establishes retina-wide, single-cell transcriptome, epigenome, and 3D genome atlases, and provides a resource for studying the gene regulatory programs of the human retina and relevant diseases."
"The indirect flight muscle is a widely used model for studying sarcomere structure and muscle development due to its extremely regular architecture. Nevertheless, precise measurement of the basic sarcomeric parameters remains a challenge even in this greatly ordered tissue. In this study, we identified several factors affecting measurement reliability and developed a software tool for precise, high-throughput measurement of sarcomere length and myofibril width. The accuracy of this new tool was validated against simulated images and blinded manual measurements. To extend the scope of this morphometric analysis to the sub-sarcomeric scale, we used electron and super-resolution microscopy to quantify myofilament number and filament length during myofibrillogenesis. These results provided novel insights into the dynamics of sarcomere growth, and enabled us to construct a refined model of sarcomere growth reaching to the level of individual myofilaments and providing a spatial framework for interpreting molecular localization data. These findings enhance our understanding of sarcomere assembly and offer a foundation for future studies of muscle development and function.

SUMMARY STATEMENTThis study identifies factors influencing sarcomere size measurements, introduces a validated tool for precise analysis, and presents a comprehensive model of Drosophila flight muscle sarcomere growth during muscle development."
"Effective diagnosis and treatment of rare genetic disorders requires the interpretation of a patients genetic variants of unknown significance (VUSs). Today, clinical decision-making is primarily guided by gene-phenotype association databases and DNA-based scoring methods. Our web-accessible variant analysis pipeline, VUStruct, supplements these established approaches by deeply analyzing the downstream molecular impact of variation in context of 3D protein structure. VUStructs growing impact is fueled by the co-proliferation of protein 3D structural models, gene sequencing, compute power, and artificial intelligence.

Contextualizing VUSs in protein 3D structural models also illuminates longitudinal genomics studies and biochemical bench research focused on VUS, and we created VUStruct for clinicians and researchers alike. We now introduce VUStruct to the broad scientific community as a mature, web-facing, extensible, High-Performance Computing (HPC) software pipeline.

VUStruct maps missense variants onto automatically selected protein structures and launches a broad range of analyses. These include energy-based assessments of protein folding and stability, pathogenicity prediction through spatial clustering analysis, and machine learning (ML) predictors of binding surface disruptions and nearby post-translational modification sites. The pipeline also considers the entire input set of VUS and identifies genes potentially involved in digenic disease.

VUStructs utility in clinical rare disease genome interpretation has been demonstrated through its analysis of over 175 Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN) Patient cases. VUStruct-leveraged hypotheses have often informed clinicians in their consideration of additional patient testing, and we report here details from two cases where VUStruct was key to their solution. We also note successes with academic research collaborators, for whom VUStruct has informed research directions in both computational genomics and wet lab studies."
"Anaesthetisia is an important surgical and explorative tool in the study of consciousness. Much work has been done to connect the deeply anaesthetised condition with decreased complexity. However, anaesthesia-induced unconsciousness is also a dynamic condition in which functional activity and complexity may fluctuate, being perturbed by internal or external (e.g. noxious) stimuli. We use fMRI data from a cohort undergoing deep propofol anaesthesia to investigate resting state dynamics using dynamic brain state models and spatiotemporal network analysis.We focus our analysis on group-level dynamics of brain state temporal complexity, functional activity, connectivity and spatiotemporal modularization in deep anaesthesia and wakefulness. We find that in contrast to dynamics in the wakeful condition, anaesthesia dynamics are dominated by a handful of sink states that act as low-complexity attractors to which subjects repeatedly return. On a subject-level, our analysis provides tentative evidence that these low complexity attractor states appear to depend on subject-specific age and anaesthesia susceptibility factors. Finally, our spatiotemporal analysis, including a novel spatiotemporal clustering of graphs representing hidden Markov models, suggests that dynamic functional organisation in anaesthesia can be characterised by mostly unchanging, isolated regional subnetworks that share some similarities with the brains underlying structural connectivity, as determined from normative tractography data."
"Synchronised developmental timing is important for ensuring crop uniformity and high yields. However, climate change is leading to crops being grown at different latitudes, varying their exposures to photoperiods over seasons and impacting developmental timings. We investigated whether the response of circadian rhythms in seedlings to changes in photoperiod would enable us to predict the timing and synchronization of flowering. Indeed, we show that the same Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) are associated to circadian traits in seedlings and developmental traits during bolting, using the first recombinant inbred lines (RILs) between African and European Arabidopsis lineages, spanning diverse latitudes. Two QTLs contain K-Homology Domain RNA binding proteins (KH17, KH29) and are associated with splicing variants in known flowering genes, MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING2 and 3 (MAF2, MAF3), including generating chimeric transcripts, a potential mechanism for accelerated proteome evolution. Natural variants in KH17, including in its prion-like domain, are associated with de-coupling the mean and synchronization of flowering time, enabling greater adaptation of population-level heterogeneity in developmental timings. Our results suggest that circadian traits in seedlings could be used to screen for agriculturally relevant developmental traits in mature plants, enabling efficient breeding of climate-resilient crops."
"Orienting movements are a critical component of the natural behavioral repertoire, but their underlying neural bases are not well understood. The deep superior colliculus (dSC) integrates input from several brain regions that influence the selection of targets for orienting movements and coordinates activity among brainstem motor nuclei to initiate and execute movement. Evidence suggests that one prominent dSC input, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), permits movement by disinhibiting its targets, but much is unknown about the relationship between SNr activity, dSC activity, and movement. Building on increasing application of the head-fixed mouse model to elucidate the neural basis of behavior, we examined neural activity recorded in dSC and SNr with high-density probes in mice performing several variants of a sensorimotor orienting task, from our labs and in data sets curated by the International Brain Laboratory. We found that dSC and SNr were active preceding and throughout movement, across task variants, suggesting that they were engaged by the required movements. Prior to movement, SNr activity reflected the outcome of the previous trial, consistent with a role in biasing movements towards the highest value target. However, the dependence of dSC activity on movement direction was weaker than in other directional orienting behaviors, and we found little evidence for strong suppression of dSC by SNr. These results complement and extend previous findings from other orienting tasks and suggest diverse roles for modulatory input from SNr to dSC in shaping motor behavior."
"Reconstituted basement membrane (rBM) products like Matrigel are widely used in 3D culture models of epithelial tissues and cancer. However, their utility is hindered by key limitations, including batch variability, xenogenic contaminants, and a lack of tunability. To address these challenges, we engineered a 3D basement membrane (eBM) matrix by conjugating defined extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion peptides (IKVAV, YIGSR, RGD) to an alginate hydrogel network with precisely tunable stiffness and viscoelasticity. We optimized the mechanical and biochemical properties of the engineered basement membranes (eBMs) to support mammary acinar morphogenesis in MCF10A cells, similar to rBM. We found that IKVAV-modified, fast-relaxing ({tau}1/2 = 30-150 s), and soft (E = 200 Pa) eBMs best promoted polarized acinar structures. Clusters became invasive and lost polarity only when the IKVAV-modified eBM exhibited both similar stiffness to a malignant breast tumor (E = 4000 Pa) and slow stress relaxation ({tau}1/2 = 600-1100 s). Notably, tumor-like stiffness alone was not sufficient to drive invasion in fast stress relaxing matrices modified with IKVAV. In contrast, RGD-modified matrices promoted a malignant phenotype regardless of mechanical properties. We also utilized this system to interrogate the mechanism driving acinar and tumorigenic phenotypes in response to microenvironmental parameters. A balance in activity between {beta}1- and {beta}4-integrins was observed in the context of IKVAV-modified eBMs, prompting further investigation into the downstream mechanisms. We found differences in hemidesmosome formation and production of endogenous laminin in response to peptide type, stress relaxation, and stiffness. We also saw that inhibiting either focal adhesion kinase or hemidesmosome signaling in IKVAV eBMs prevented acinus formation. This eBM matrix is a powerful, reductionist, xenogenic-free system, offering a robust platform for both fundamental research and translational applications in tissue engineering and disease modeling."
"Neuroimaging studies have identified the neural substrates associated with sustained cognitive efforts and control and their modulation by rewards. Different lines of evidence implicate the prefrontal cortex (especially the anterior cingulum, ACC), dopaminergic, and cholinergic substrates in this modulation. We studied here the activity of these substrates at increasing time on task (providing increasing levels of cognitive effort) in trial blocks with differing reward levels. In the cortex, while peaking in the ACC, activity associated with time on task was extensive, also including activity decrements outside the default mode network, primarily involving motor and somatosensory regions. Information about reward levels was carried in the ventral striatum, consistent with its motivational role, but did not reflect trade-offs with increasing efforts during time on task. Instead, the ventral tegmental area and parts of the basal forebrain (BF) corresponding to the cholinergic Ch4 nuclei increased in activity with time on task and were sensitive to reward levels. This BF activity is consistent with a cholinergic role in driving compensatory efforts modulated by reward levels. These findings identify the BF as a neuroimaging phenotype associated with sustaining task sets and cognitive efforts."
"Many substances/drugs are administered intranasally (IN). These include opioid overdose reversal drugs, anti-epileptic medications, migraine medications, hormone treatments, and medicines to treat/prevent allergies, colds, and flues including nasally-administered vaccines, corticosteroids, antihistamines, and decongestants. Additionally, IN administration is the preferred route of entry by users of illicit drugs. Despite the widespread use of the IN route of administration, there is no established paradigm to access this route of administration preclinically to yield precise and reliable control over delivery. This poses major gaps in therapeutic discovery/testing, establishing pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships of therapeutics, and understanding the mechanisms of actions of therapeutics. We developed an in-dwelling microfluidic device, that, when implanted upon the nasal bone, accesses the nasal cavity to allow reliable and precise IN fluid delivery during freely-moving behavior. We validated this device, called the Nasal Access Port (NAP), to confirm it allows rapid and precise control of fluids. We further exemplified the application of the NAP for studying outcomes of IN cocaine in mice, including its pharmacokinetic profile, and both the rapid release of dopamine (DA) and behavioral effects upon IN cocaine. By achieving precise and reliable access to the IN route of administration, the NAP represents a significant methodological advance with broad applicability in the biomedical and life sciences, especially in the neuroscience, pharmacology, medicinal chemistry, and physiology domains."
"Saliva-based biomarkers offer a non-invasive, convenient, and patient-friendly approach for gastric cancer (GC) diagnosis, eliminating the need for uncomfortable procedures. This study aimed to identify salivary extracellular RNA (exRNA) biomarkers capable of distinguishing GC from normal samples. We used GEO dataset containing exRNA expression profiles of 98 GC and 100 normal samples. We filtered the data and applied the Mann-Whitney U test to identify statistically significant salivary exRNAs (p < 0.05). Initially, a single gene-based classification method identified potential biomarkers including GSDMA, SMR3B, NPTXR, TBCD, KCNC4, and KRT26, achieving accuracies ranging from 61.61% to 64.14%. Then, we applied AI-based methods to identify GC biomarkers. We developed machine learning models on different sets of biomarkers extracted from the original set of statistically significant exRNA using feature selection methods. An optimal primary biomarker set of eight mRNAs (GSDMA, CCDC141, TBCD, STARD13, WRB, ARHGAP23, CDHR3, BX842679.1) was identified, yielding an AUC of 0.905 and MCC of 0.770 with an ensemble stacking classifier. We performed comparative analysis with existing GC biomarker studies which demonstrated that our identified primary biomarker set outperformed previously reported biomarker panels. Out of the eight identified genes, seven have been reported in the literature to be associated with Gastric Cancer. Our results demonstrate the potential of salivary exRNA biomarkers as a non-invasive tool for GC diagnosis.

"Glioblastoma (GBM) contain mesenchymal cancer stem cells that drive tumor aggressiveness and recurrence and exhibit aberrant glycosylation during proneural-to-mesenchymal transition. A comprehensive analysis of human GBM transcriptomic datasets revealed an upregulation of 13 genes involved in mannosylation. Histopathological staining of a tissue array representing 35 GBM cases revealed elevated mannose, correlating with increased expression of the mesenchymal marker CD44. Mannose-weighted chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging (MANw CEST MRI) detected elevated mannose levels in aggressive mesenchymal GBM neurospheres in vitro and in vivo, but not in less aggressive non-mesenchymal phenotype. To establish causation, inhibiting the expression of the mannose binding lectins LMAN1/2 that regulate intracellular processing of mannosylated proteins decreased the glioma cell MANw CEST MRI signal. Our findings indicate that MANw CEST MRI can visualize high mannose levels in mesenchymal GBM cells, which may serve as a surrogate imaging biomarker for predicting and assessing tumor aggressiveness and recurrence."
"Today, there are several effective deep learning models for predicting the 3D structure of proteins. Building on their success, models have been developed for predicting the 3D structure of non-coding RNAs. Unfortunately, these models are much less accurate than their protein counterparts. In this paper, we highlight differences between protein and RNA structure, and demonstrate methods for deep learning targeted at addressing those differences, with the aim of prompting discussion on these topics. We present an RNA-specific pipeline for generating structural Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs). Derived from the structural alignments, we introduce engineered evolutionary features that strongly inform RNA structure. Further, from the crystal structure, we derive structural features describing RNA base pairing. These evolutionary and structural features can be used in loss functions at different stages of training. Finally, we discuss different cropping strategies informed by RNA structure."
"Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) is caused by cassava brown streak viruses (CBSVs) from the family Potyviridae. Potyvirid viral genome-linked protein (VPg) recruitment of host eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) proteins is a critical step in the viral life cycle. CBSV VPg interacts with all five cassava eIF4E-family members. Simultaneously knocking out eIF4E-family genes nCBP-1 and nCBP-2, in cultivar 60444, strongly reduces CBSD root symptoms and viral titer but does not result in complete resistance, likely due to gene family redundancy. To test for redundancy, we generated single and double mutants for each clade of the eIF4E gene family in farmer preferred cultivar TME419. Double mutants for the eIF(iso)4E and nCBP clades both exhibited reduced symptom severity, with ncbp-1 ncbp-2 having the strongest phenotype. A yeast two-hybrid screen for nCBP-2 mutants that lose VPg affinity identified fifty-one mutants, including an L51F mutant. This finding is consistent with one of the recovered cassava mutants that had a 6 amino acid deletion, including L51, in nCBP-2 and showed a reduction in symptoms relative to wild type. The data presented here suggest that generating mutations corresponding to L51F of nCBP-2 in multiple or all five cassava eIF4E proteins may lead to stronger resistance to CBSD while avoiding pleiotropic effects."
"Micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are key post-transcriptional regulators of the immune system and may play a role in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). In this paper, we constructed subject-specific miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks using bulk and deconvoluted whole blood RNA-sequencing, whole blood miRNA-sequencing, and B-cell receptor-sequencing data from up to 570 miRNAs, 11,859 mRNAs, and 3,190 participants in the COPDGene study.

Analysis of whole blood networks revealed two subnetworks of miRNA-mRNA interactions significantly (FDR<0.05) associated with changes in FEV1/FVC. We found that miRNAs (and mRNAs) in the network-identified groups had distinct expression patterns, with miRNAs (and mRNAs) in one group having overall higher expression in COPD (decreasing FEV1/FVC) and miRNAs (and mRNAs) in the other group having overall higher expression in controls (increasing FEV1/FVC). In addition, miRNAs (and mRNAs) within the same group were positively correlated, while those in different groups were negatively correlated, indicating distinct functional roles for these miRNAs (and mRNAs) as a function of increased COPD severity. Network analysis also identified PAX5, a transcription factor master regulator of B-cell development, as the main mRNA network hub. Using ChIP-seq data in lymphoblastoid cells, we identified a PAX5 binding site overlapping with a COPD genome-wide association signal in the promoter region of ADAM19. We also found a loss of co-expression between PAX5 and ADAM19 in COPD subjects. Furthermore, in B-cell deconvoluted data, PAX5 was differentially co-expressed with genes associated with B-cell activation and differentiation, revealing a possible mechanism for the regulation of the immune response in COPD. Finally, in B-cell receptor sequencing data, PAX5 and the identified mRNA subnetworks were negatively associated (FDR<0.05) with immunoglobulin class switching, and positively associated with IgM and IgD counts.

In conclusion, PAX5 is a known regulator of B-cell identity. B cells are recognized as key players in chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation in COPD. Our work suggests that PAX5 plays a mediating role both in ADAM19 regulation and in miRNA regulation of early B cells in COPD."
"Pinctada radiata, commonly known as the Gulf pearl oyster, is a species of pearl oyster found primarily in the warm waters of the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, and parts of the Indian Ocean. Pinctada radiata contributes to marine ecosystems by filtering water, which helps maintain water quality and supports other marine life. This species is the first bivalve Lessepsian migrant, having migrated from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal. The reference genome of Pinctada radiata could help identify genes enabling adaptation to varying temperatures and salinities, facilitating survival in diverse and newly colonized habitats allowing comparisons with other bivalves to uncover shared and unique genetic adaptations. Additionally, the genome could support targeted management practices and conservation initiatives, such as habitat restoration and selective breeding, ensuring the long-term sustainability of P. radiata. The entirety of the genome sequence was assembled into 14 contiguous chromosomal pseudomolecules. This chromosome-level assembly encompasses 0.93 Gb, composed of 220 contigs and 44 scaffolds, with contig and scaffold N50 values of 8.1 Mb and 63.8 Mb, respectively."
"Antibiotic resistance poses a global public health threat. Cefiderocol, a recently introduced siderophore cephalosporin, employs a ""Trojan Horse"" mechanism by exploiting bacterial iron uptake systems for cell entry. Yet, resistant clinical isolates are already observed in clinics and resistance mechanisms are difficult to characterize. Here, we applied functional metagenomics to identify cefiderocol resistance genes. Functional metagenomic DNA libraries from diverse environmental samples collected across several countries were expressed in a cefiderocol-sensitive Escherichia coli host. This yielded four resistant clones with DNA originating from wastewater or freshwater DNA libraries. The identified antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) causing an increase in cefiderocol minimum inhibitory concentrations encoded for beta-lactamases (VEB-3, OXA-372 homolog and YbxI homolog) and a partial penicillin binding protein homolog. Three of four shared closest homologs in pathogenic bacteria. One ARG was associated with a mobile genetic element and was broadly distributed across all wastewater samples from every country surveyed. This study underscores the critical importance of environmental surveillance for ARGs, particularly for novel agents like cefiderocol with limited understanding of resistance mechanisms."
"Dynamic functional connectivity (FC) in neonates is a growing area of interest due to the developmental significance of early functional networks. There are several emerging techniques to measure dynamic FC, adding new perspectives to well-studied static FC networks. Recent dynamic FC studies suggest that adult resting state networks are driven by key moments of dynamic activity rather than sustained correlations. Co-activation pattern (CAP) analysis leverages this theory, clustering high-activity frames to identify recurring configurations of significant activity. High-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) is an infant-friendly modality that measures hemodynamic changes in the cortex. HD-DOT has been used to investigate static FC in term-aged infants. The CAP approach is a promising avenue to examine dynamic FC in neonates, but it is yet untested in neonatal HD-DOT. This study validates the CAP approach for neonatal HD-DOT and presents novel decompositions of neonate FC networks.

HD-DOT data were acquired from a cohort of sleeping term newborns at the Rosie Hospital, Cambridge UK (n = 44, postmenstrual age = 40+3 (range: 38+2 - 42+6) weeks). The top 15% of seed-selected frames were clustered using the K-means algorithm for three regions of interest (ROIs: frontal, central, and parietal) to identify significant seed-associated patterns of co-activation or co-deactivation. These patterns (CAPs) were characterized using four metrics: consistency, fractional occupancy, dwell time, and transition likelihood.

Distinct CAPs were identified for frontal, central, and parietal regions of interest. These CAPs had high consistency scores, validating the efficacy of the CAP methodology for newborn HD-DOT. The CAP decomposition revealed significant patterns obscured by static analysis. Several neonate CAPs illustrate frontoparietal activity, potentially reflecting early default mode network activity, which is immature and modular for the first year after birth.

This work demonstrates the utility of CAP analysis with newborn HD-DOT and provides new insight into brain dynamics of early resting state networks."
"This article explores the close relationship between dissolved inorganic carbonate ion concentration (DIC) and the calcification state of Phacotus lenticularis, a globally abundant freshwater phytoplankton that is responsible for a significant part of modern lake carbonate production during bloom formation. We cultured 12 freshly isolated P. lenticularis strains under an ecologically relevant range of DIC (0.2 to 12 mmol l-1 total scale) for 14 days. From this experiment we gained information on responses in shell formation and growth that highlight strong lower boundaries in morphometric calcite shell variables with regards to DIC. All P. lenticularis strains showed reduced shell thickness by up to 60 % and dissolved calcite crystals structures at declining DIC < 4 mmol l-1. Increasing DIC > 4 mmol l-1 had no significant effect on shell thickness and crystal length in the culture experiments. We found a significant preadaptation of all 12 strains to ambient DIC concentrations measured in their lake of origin, but no dependence of growth rates up to a lethal DIC of > 10 mmol l-1. The simulation experiments illustrate the close relationship between shell function and dissolved inorganic carbonate ion concentration in lakes and highlight the need of continued research of important roles in biogenic carbon transformation and storage in a future world."
"Network science has revolutionized our understanding of brain organization by revealing self-organizing patterns underlying its structural and functional connectivity. However, capturing metabolic contrast remains a challenge, leaving a critical gap in connectomics. Using advanced 3D whole-brain proton MR spectroscopic imaging with high spatial resolution and shortened acquisition times, we constructed the first human brain metabolic connectome in 51 healthy subjects, validated on an independent cohort (N=12) scanned at a different site. Our pipeline generates consistent and reliable metabolic similarity matrices. Upon further analysis, metabolic similarity networks display distinct topological features, notably a smoothly varying gradient delineating functionally and spatially distinct yet integrated brain regions via connector hubs. Although metabolic hubs correlate with structural hubs, overall alignment with structural connectivity is poor. However, metabolic organization aligns more closely with cytoarchitectonic and genetic co-expression patterns, suggesting a neurodevelopmental origin. This work puts forward the metabolic similarity gradient as a hallmark of the brains overarching biochemical organization, and provides a foundation for incorporating metabolite imaging into the broader domain of connectomics and its potential applications in health and disease."
"Carrying capacity is a fundamental concept in ecology that has inspired the development and application of a broad range of population models. In the context of fisheries science, production models have been employed globally to calculate carrying capacity and guide the sustainable use of fish populations. Production models have, however, been criticized for failing to account for species interactions and environmental effects. We aim to fill some of these gaps by introducing a novel state-space multispecies production model. We apply our extended model to commercially important demersal fish species off the east coast of Canada to assess its ability to reveal species interactions and the relative impacts of fishing and environmental effects. Our results indicate that accounting for species interactions increases the accuracy of biomass estimates for species within a community. The model also revealed strongly correlated process deviations, unrelated to fishing or density-dependent effects, which unexpectidly indicates that widespread collapses were primarily driven by a common environmental driver rather than fishing. Such inferences indicate that this may be a promising avenue for producing more holistic and accurate assessments for multiple species with relatively minimal data requirements (time-series of landings and fisheries-independent indices). Finally, this approach may serve as a stepping stone towards an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management."
"Antibacterial additive use has surged due to rising incidences of food contamination, despite concerns over antibiotic resistance. Bacteriophage (bacterial viruses) represent a unique and promising opportunity as antibacterial agents, offering targeted bacterial lysis while being food safe. However, their commercial success has been limited by the significant diffusion barriers they face within food, preventing effective delivery at contamination sites. Here, we introduce bacteriophage-loaded microneedle patches that enable targeted phage delivery directly within food, eliminating internal pathogens in a minimally disruptive manner. The application of microneedles within food is first explored. The platform is then substantiated by comparing performance in raw beef and cooked chicken, where we achieved up to 3-logs reduction in Escherichia coli, thus providing complete decontamination according to regulatory limits. In contrast, conventional surface application of the same phage failed to provide significant decontamination. To ensure broad applicability, phage cocktails were also loaded into microneedles to demonstrate polymicrobial decontamination against other common food contaminants including Salmonella. This platform can also be adapted to extend food shelf-life by targeting spoilage-inducing bacteria."
"PurposeShenQi Compound (SQC) is a traditional herbal formula that has long been utilized in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and its complications. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of SQC on mitochondrial energy metabolism in pancreatic tissues of spontaneously type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats.

MethodsGK rats were induced into a diabetic model using a high-fat diet. They were randomly divided into 3 groups (n=8): diabetes model group, SQC group (14.4 g/kg/d) and metformin (Met) group (0.1 g/kg/d). Another 8 Wistar rats were taken as controls. Weight, Blood glucose was monitored weekly in each group,After 12 weeks of gavage. Fasting blood glucose and lipid levels were evaluated, and histopathological changes in the pancreas were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, serum fasting insulin(FINS) and pancreatic mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I-V (complexI-V) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reactive oxygen species ((ROS)) levels were detected by chemiluminescence, superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were detected by xanthine oxidase, and glutathione (GSH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were detected by colorimetric assay. And the uncoupling protein(UCP-2) protein and mRNA expression levels were detected by protein blotting and real-time quantitative PCR.

ResultsSQC treatment significantly decreased (P<0.01) the levels of FBS, FINS,triglyceride s(TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (P<0.01) and significantly increased (P<0.01) the levels of denser lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in GK rats. Pancreatic histopathological damage was improved after SQC treatment, and complexI to complexIV significantly decreased (P<0.05) and complexV, SOD and GSH significantly increased (P<0.05) in pancreatic tissues. In addition, SQC reduced the content of ROS and ATP in pancreatic tissues (P<0.01) and down-regulated UCP-2 protein and mRNA expression (P<0.01).

ConclusionSQC improves glucose-lipid metabolism and attenuates pathological damage of pancreatic tissues in T2DM rats, possibly by regulating mitochondrial energy metabolism in pancreatic tissues. The effects of SQC are not well understood. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of action of SQC in the treatment of T2DM and its associated neurodegenerative effects."
"Undaria pinnatifida is a large brown algae native to the northwest Pacific. It has been introduced to numerous countries and is listed among the worlds 100 worst invasive species. However, it is also edible and produces various bioactive compounds, making it commercially important. Despite its ecological and economic value, the viruses that infect U. pinnatifida remain unknown. In this study, a population-wide genome analysis was performed to investigate viral infection signatures in U. pinnatifida. A nearly complete 551-Kb giant endogenous viral element of a Nucleocytoviricota virus was identified on a pseudochromosome in the Korean strain genome Upin_Kr2015. This viral region contained viral hallmark genes and auxiliary metabolic genes, including kinases and GDP-mannose dehydrogenase. Additionally, we detected viral hallmark genes in all 43 whole-genome assemblies analyzed, with origins tracing to the orders Pandoravirales, Algavirales, or Imitevirales. Our findings provide strong evidence of frequent U. pinnatifida infections by multiple Nucleocytoviricota viruses."
"While the embodiment of non-human body parts is well-established, the precise conditions that facilitate this remain incompletely understood. One critical yet underexplored factor is whether the non-human body part affords greater or lesser functionality than its biological counterpart. This study investigated how the sensorimotor capabilities of a dynamic virtual arm modulate the experience of embodiment. Given that childrens body representations are widely considered to be more flexible than those of adults, they may be especially suited to embodying functionally altered virtual bodies. To test this, both child and adult participants engaged in goal-directed forward reaching movements with a virtual arm to feed animals within an immersive virtual environment. Reaching functionality was systematically manipulated via changes in visual gain, adjusting the arms length and functionality from a normal (100%) condition, to be slightly reduced (80%); slightly increased (120%); or markedly increased (400%). Our findings reveal that extreme alterations in reaching functionality (400% visual gain) significantly reduced subjective ratings of limb ownership, an effect most evident in adult participants. Despite these perceptual disruptions, participants across all ages adjusted their reach kinematics in ways that reflected an integration of the virtual arms perceived capabilities with the physical limitations of their own bodies. Interestingly, children responded to the altered embodiment with more cautious and less refined movement strategies than adults, suggesting developmental differences in adaptive motor control over non-human bodies. Moreover, across both age groups, exposure to functionally enhanced virtual arms led to increased subjective estimates of reaching affordances, highlighting the influence of altered sensorimotor feedback on perceived action capabilities. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the sense of body ownership, the accuracy of body representations, and the properties of sensorimotor control are closely associated with bodily function. Moreover, while children may exhibit greater tolerance to functional alterations in terms of perceived ownership, they do not show superior motor control. These findings reveal that sensorimotor function and developmental factors interact to shape the boundaries of embodiment in virtual contexts."
"We examined the comparative phylogeography of five co-distributed lizard complexes (representing four genera within Phrynosomatidae) along the Baja California Peninsula (BCP) in the context of the regions complex geological history. Double-digest restriction-associated-DNA (ddRAD) sequencing was used to collect genome-wide sequence data for 228 peninsular lizards. Using phylogenetic analyses of concatenated loci and population admixture analysis of unlinked SNPs, we identified 24 potential lineages within the five co-distributed complexes. Four of the five complexes exhibited contact zones between lineages at the Isthmus of La Paz, and all five did in the Vizcaino Desert. To generate data for a species tree model, we subsampled two lizards from each of these 24 lineages for use with a target sequence capture (TSC) protocol. The resulting time-calibrated species tree shows that within each genus, the La Paz divergences are older than those across the Vizcaino Desert. A full-likelihood Bayesian comparative phylogeographic approach was also used to test the simultaneous divergence hypothesis for the Isthmus of La Paz and Vizcaino Desert, providing strong support for at least three independent divergence events at each contact zone, thereby rejecting the simultaneous divergence hypothesis. Finally, we demonstrate through expanded geographic sampling (n=142) and ddRAD that zebra-tailed lizards (Callisaurus), in which the most divergent lineages are endemic to the southern BCP, exhibit a clear pattern of Pleistocene range expansion from the northern BCP into the deserts of the western United States and mainland Mexico. The most deeply nested individuals in our tree occur at the northern, eastern, and southeastern range limits in temperate, subtropical, and tropical biomes, respectively. These results collectively highlight the importance of the BCPs tectonic isolation as a driver not only of local or peninsular endemism, but potentially also as a contributing factor to lineage diversification more broadly in the region."
"The NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome senses pathogenic bacteria by recognizing the cytosolic presence of bacterial proteins such as flagellin and type III secretion system (T3SS) subunits. In mice, the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome provides robust protection against bacterial pathogens that infect intestinal epithelial cells, including the gastrointestinal pathogen Shigella flexneri. By contrast, humans are highly susceptible to Shigella, despite the ability of human NAIP-NLRC4 to robustly detect Shigella T3SS proteins. Why the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome protects mice but not humans against Shigella infection remains unclear. We previously found that human THP-1 cells infected with Shigella lose responsiveness to NAIP-NLRC4 stimuli, while retaining sensitivity to other inflammasome agonists. Using mT3Sf, a ""minimal Shigella"" system, to express individual secreted Shigella effector proteins, we found that the OspF effector specifically suppresses NAIP-NLRC4-dependent cell death during infection. OspF was previously characterized as a phosphothreonine lyase that inactivates p38 and ERK MAP kinases. We found that p38 was critical for rapid priming of NAIP-NLRC4 activity, particularly in cells with low NAIP-NLRC4 expression. Overall, our results provide a mechanism by which Shigella evades inflammasome activation in humans, and describe a new mechanism for rapid priming of the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome."
"A better understanding of lymphocyte dynamics during current treatment regimens in pediatric AML is urgently needed to understand whether the application of bispecific T-cell-engagers (BiTEs) during periods of low tumor burden could be a viable treatment strategy. In this study, we found that induction 1, comprising mitoxantrone-etoposide-cytarabine in nearly all patients (as part of the NOPHO-DBH AML-2012 protocol), led to preserved or increased relative lymphocyte abundances alongside marked blast reduction in most cases. This was accompanied by a shift towards higher T-cell fractions, potentially creating a favorable window for BiTE therapy. The absence of a correlation between blast reduction and lymphocyte changes suggests that chemotherapy exerts differential effects on the lymphocyte compartment. Despite the heterogeneity of agents used in induction 2, more than half of patients showed a decline in lymphocyte levels. Nonetheless, the increase in T- and B-cells observed in most patients from the NOPHO-AML 2004 cohort after induction 2 suggests that lymphocyte recovery at this treatment stage is not uniformly impaired. Our transcriptomic and ex vivo functional data align with preclinical findings in adult AML and provide a basis for further investigations in in vivo models and early clinical trials. Such efforts should prioritize novel BiTE constructs targeting multiple tumor-associated (e.g., NCT05673057) or tumor-specific antigens."
"Impaired academic performance is often attributed to attentional deficits, but it remains unclear whether these reflect long-term traits or momentary fluctuations in attention. This study investigated how acute attention during engaging educational videos and trait measures of attention influenced test taking performance. Short-term retention was assessed in 152 students across four experiments using short-form educational videos. Behavioral trait measures of inattention, hyperactivity, and working memory capacity were also obtained. Acute attention, measured by EEG during video viewing, was a strong predictor of test scores. In contrast, self-reported trait measures of attention were not significant predictors. Working memory capacity and GPA positively predicted test scores. Inattention traits predicted GPA, suggesting a negative effect on overall academic performance. These results suggest that attentional traits only weakly and indirectly affect student performance. Modifying teaching methods, may help address learning deficits in inattentive students, who seem to have no problem attending to, and retaining the content of short, engaging educational videos."
"Microtubules exist in expanded and compacted states, as defined by the lattice spacing of {beta}-tubulin dimers. Changes in lattice spacing has been linked to factors such as GTP-hydrolysis, the binding of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), the tubulin code, and microtubule bending. These diverse factors exert opposing molecular driving forces on the microtubule lattice that push lattice spacing towards expanded or compacted states. To better understand how these opposing forces are reconciled, we developed in vitro and cell-based model systems for the competition between a microtubule expander (paclitaxel) and a microtubule compactor (Doublecortin, or DCX). Using an in vitro reconstitution approach, we show that paclitaxel expands microtubules cooperatively. In cells, high concentrations of paclitaxel cause DCX to relocalize to compacted lattices found at concave bends. When the concentration of DCX is increased, however, we find that DCX re-compacts the previously expanded microtubules in vitro. Consistently, high expression levels of DCX prevent its relocalization in paclitaxel treated cells. When the competition between paclitaxel and DCX is ""balanced"", we observe a complex phenotype: DCX simultaneously localized to both long, straight clusters and concave bends, while other regions on the microtubule network remained DCX-free. We conclude that multiple lattice spacings can coexist in cells. Our results indicate that competition for microtubule lattice spacing is a critical aspect of microtubule physiology."
"Deconvolution of the protein targets of hit compounds from phenotypic screens, often conducted in live cells, is critical for understanding mechanism of action and identifying potentially hazardous off-target interactions. While photoaffinity labeling and chemoproteomics are long-established approaches for discovering small-molecule-protein interactions in live cells, there are a relatively small number of photoaffinity labeling strategies that can be applied in intracellular settings. Recently, we reported a novel chemical framework for photoaffinity labeling based on the photo-Brook rearrangement of acyl silanes and demonstrated its ability, when appended to protein-targeting ligands, to label recombinant proteins. Here, we report the application of these probes to live cell photoaffinity workflows, demonstrate their complementarity to current state-of-the-art minimalist diazirine-based photoaffinity probes, and introduce a modular synthetic route to access acyl silane scaffolds with improved labeling properties."
"Research into the evolution of multicellularity often focuses on clonal multicellularity, yet aggregative multicellularity (AM) may respond to different drivers and is also highly interesting evolutionarily, for example in its behavioral, regulatory, morphological, and social complexity and diversity. We investigate the potential for predation to shape AM evolution across different combinations of three species comprising a multi-trophic food web. Together in a three-species community, the fruiting bacterium Myxococcus xanthus is a mesopredator, while the bacterivorous nematode Pristionchus pacificus is apex predator and the bacterium Escherichia coli is a shared basal prey for both predators. The number and morphology of M. xanthus fruiting bodies is found to respond evolutionarily to nematodes, regardless of whether E. coli is present. E. coli alone with M. xanthus tends to reduce both fruiting body formation and spore production, but adding nematodes eliminates those negative effects. M. xanthus lineages with an ancestral antibiotic-resistance mutation evolved less overall, revealing strong historical contingency and suggesting potential tradeoffs between antibiotic-resistance and responsiveness to biotic selection. Our results suggest that predation both of and by mesopredators has played important roles in the evolution of aggregative multicellularity and reveal complex inter-trophic evolutionary interactions in a relatively simple three-species food web."
"The field of renal denervation remains challenged by the inability to confirm successful ablation of the targeted renal sympathetic nerves. The availability of technology to measure regional blood flow in real time makes sympathetic control of the renal vasculature a logical endpoint to assess effective renal denervation, but autoregulatory mechanisms mask effects on mean renal blood flow. We hypothesized that renal sympathetic vasomotion, a novel marker of rhythmic sympathetic control, reflects successive rounds of catheter-based radiofrequency renal denervation. To test this, ten pigs underwent unilateral surgical renal denervation, recovered for at least seven days, and then underwent four successive rounds of catheter-based radiofrequency denervation of the contralateral kidney. Bilateral renal blood flow velocity and abdominal aortic pressure were measured before and after ablations to assess renal vasomotion. Prior to catheter-based denervation, the renal vasomotion profiles of the innervated and surgically denervated kidneys differed significantly (P < 0.005). Ablation of the largest renal branch artery reduced renal sympathetic vasomotion by 52%. Ablation of the remaining renal branch arteries reduced sympathetic vasomotion 95% from baseline and eliminated the statistical differences between surgically and catheter denervated kidneys. Two additional rounds of catheter denervation of the main renal artery did not consistently decrease renal sympathetic vasomotion magnitude any further. These results indicate that renal sympathetic vasomotion could provide intraprocedural feedback for interventionalists performing catheter-based renal denervation and thereby improve the efficacy, safety, and consistency of this antihypertensive intervention."
"In prokaryotes, the energy-dependent protein degradation is controlled primarily by two ATP-dependent proteases, Lon and Clp. This study investigates the roles of the Lon protease in the metabolism of 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), a toxic industrial compound, in Escherichia coli (E. coli). During the study, an observation was made that the absence of Lon protease resulted in an enhanced conversion of yellow coloured 2,4-DNP to a reddish-brown product. This study aims to characterise the compound observed in the media with wild type (WT) and {Delta}lon strains, understand the mechanisms of 2,4-DNP conversion and decipher the roles of Lon protease in the conversion of 2,4-DNP. UV-visible and LC-MS analyses revealed differences in the conversion products between the WT and {Delta}lon strains. One of the substrates of Lon protease is MarA, a transcription factor. Growth studies with different mutants and trans-complemented strains demonstrated MarA-dependent conversion. The bathochromic shift of spectral peaks suggested a reduction process and possible involvement of nitroreductase enzymes. Indeed, the expression of two nitroreductases, nfsA and nfsB, increased with 2,4-DNP and was dependent on MarA. Importantly, the production of the reddish-brown product was lower in strains lacking nfsA or nfsB. Finally, LC-MS analysis identified one of the conversion products of 2,4-DNP to be 4-Amino-2-nitrophenol (4,2-ANP). Dose studies with purified 4,2-ANP demonstrated that it did not lower the growth of E. coli (unlike 2,4-DNP) but induced phenotypic antibiotic resistance (like 2,4-DNP). This study contributes to our understanding of biological treatment of nitroaromatics and may offer insights into environmental pollution mitigation strategies.

ImportanceThis study identifies the roles of Lon protease and its substrate MarA in inducing nitroreductases, NfsA and NfsB, in reducing toxic 2,4-DNP to less toxic 4,2-ANP, a novel inducer of phenotypic antibiotic resistance. This study contributes to understanding the biological treatment of nitroaromatics, offering insights into environmental pollution mitigation strategies and the development of efficient bioremediation techniques."
"Predicting the outcomes of species invasions is a central goal of ecology, a task made especially challenging due to ecological feedbacks. To address this, we develop a general theory of ecological invasions applicable to a wide variety of ecological models: including Lotka-Volterra models, consumer resource models, and models with cross feeding. Importantly, our framework remains valid even when invading evolved (non-random) communities and accounts for invasion-driven species extinctions. We derive analytical expressions relating invasion fitness to invader abundance, shifts in the community, and extinction probabilities. These results can be understood through a new quantity we term ""dressed invasion fitness"", which augments the traditional notion of invasion fitness by incorporating ecological feedbacks. We apply our theory to analyze short-term evolutionary dynamics through a series of invasions by mutants whose traits are correlated with an existing parent. We demonstrate that, generically, mutants and parents can coexist, often by driving the extinction of low-abundance species. We validate theoretical predictions against experimental datasets spanning ecosystems from plants to microbial protists. Our work highlights the central role of ecological feedbacks in shaping community responses to invasions and mutations, suggesting that parent-mutant coexistence is widespread in eco-evolutionary dynamics."
"MotivationControlling the outcomes of CRISPR editing is crucial for the success of gene therapy. Since donor template-based editing is often inefficient, alternative strategies have emerged that leverage mutagenic end-joining repair instead. Existing machine learning models can accurately predict end-joining repair outcomes, however: generalisability beyond the specific cell line used for training remains a challenge, and interpretability is typically limited by suboptimal feature representation and model architecture.

ResultsWe propose X-CRISP, a flexible and interpretable neural network for predicting repair outcome frequencies based on a minimal set of outcome and sequence features, including microhomologies (MH). Outperforming prior models on detailed and aggregate outcome predictions, X-CRISP prioritised MH location over MH sequence properties such as GC content for deletion outcomes. Through transfer learning, we adapted X-CRISP pre-trained on wild-type mESC data to target human cell lines K562, HAP1, U2OS, and mESC lines with altered DNA repair function. Adapted X-CRISP models improved over direct training on target data from as few as 50 samples, suggesting that this strategy could be leveraged to build models for new domains using a fraction of the data required to train models from scratch.

AvailabilityAn implementation of X-CRISP is available at github.com/joanagoncalveslab/xcrisp."
"The Shola Sky Islands of the Western Ghats are isolated montane habitats that harbour significant avian diversity and endemism. This study assessed bird species diversity across five mountain ranges in Wayanad, Kerala (Banasura, Brahmagiri, Camels Hump, Kuricharmala, and Manikunnu) situated above 1200 meters. A total of 114 species were recorded, with the Camels Hump range supporting the highest diversity (81 species). Patterns of species richness were found to correspond with mountain area and degree of isolation, consistent with the principles of island biogeography. Birds were classified by taxonomic order and family, with Passeriformes being the most dominant order. Among families, Muscicapidae recorded the highest number of species, followed by Accipitridae and Phylloscopidae. Invertivores constituted the majority of trophic guilds, and species richness showed a general decline with increasing elevation. These findings highlight the importance of habitat area and connectivity in shaping avian communities within sky island ecosystems. They also underline the urgent need for targeted conservation efforts in this ecologically sensitive region, much of which falls under territorial divisions, including reserve and vested forests."
"Working memory (WM) decline in ageing may be related to increases in ""neural noise"", potentially reflected in the EEG aperiodic exponent. We reanalysed previously published data to investigate age-related differences in the aperiodic exponent during verbal WM and its relationship with neural inefficiency. EEG was recorded from 24 younger (18-35 years) and 30 older adults (50-86 years) during a modified Sternberg task with 1-letter, 3-letter, and 5-letter load conditions. Younger adults consistently demonstrated steeper aperiodic slopes than older adults, though this difference was less pronounced in frontal regions during retention. Unexpectedly, both age groups showed decreased (i.e. flattened) aperiodic exponents during retention relative to fixation, with minimal load-dependent effects. Notably, the relationship between task-related exponent changes and WM performance was complex and dependent on the exponent at fixation, particularly in older adults. Finally, flatter exponents during fixation and late retention were associated with greater neural inefficiency during stimulus processing, reflected by increased P3b amplitudes without corresponding WM performance improvements. These findings suggest that flatter exponents are associated with less efficient neural processing and that older adults flexibly modulate their aperiodic exponent during retention to support WM performance."
"In therian mammals, inactivation of one of the X-chromosomes in females balances the dosage of X-linked gene expression between the sexes. On the other hand, upregulation of active-X balances the dosage of monoallelically expressed X-linked genes with biallelic autosomal genes (AA). Factors and mechanisms involved in the maintenance of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) and X to autosome dosage compensation remain underexplored. Recently, it has been implicated that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification contributes to XCI and X to autosome dosage compensation. Here, we have investigated the role of m6A RNA methylation in the maintenance of XCI and X to autosome dosage compensation in early embryonic lineages. Surprisingly, we find that the depletion of m6A RNA methylation does not affect the maintenance of inactive-X gene silencing in mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSC), trophoblast stem cells (TSC) and extraembryonic endoderm stem cells (XEN). On the other hand, we show that m6A marks are less enriched on X-linked transcripts than the autosomal transcripts in early embryonic lineages. It is believed that less enrichment of m6A in X-linked transcript increases the stability of the X-linked transcript and thereby contributes to the X to autosome dosage compensation. Interestingly, we find that while X-linked transcripts without m6A are fully dosage compensated, transcripts with m6A undergo partial X to autosome dosage compensation in EpiSC, TSC and XEN. However, we find that the depletion of m6A has a minor effect on the X to autosome dosage compensation. Taken together, our study provides significant insight into the role of m6A RNA methylation in dosage compensation of early embryonic lineages."
"The immune system is hypothesised to contribute to the onset of endometriosis lesions. However, the precise mechanisms underlying its role are not yet known. We introduce a novel compartmental model that describes the interactions between innate immune cells, specifically macrophages and natural killer cells, and endometrial cells, occurring within the peritoneal fluid during the early stages of (superficial peritoneal) endometriosis lesion onset. Our study focuses on retrograde influx, immune detection, and immune clearance. Results show an increased influx of endometrial cells into peritoneal fluid correlates with heightened pro-inflammatory macrophage activation, but does not lead to an increase in disease. We compare the systems response to changes in immune cytotoxicity and ability to detect ectopic endometrial cells. We predict that reduced cytotoxicity is a key driver of disease. These findings align with the increased immune activation observed clinically. Lastly, we predict that an individual can transition to a diseased state following a reduction in immune system cytotoxicity and/or reduced ability to detect ectopic cells. Due to hysteresis, a significant improvement is then required to restore an individual to the disease-free state. This work provides a valuable framework to explore hypotheses of endometriosis lesion onset and assist in understanding of the disease."
"Statistical causal learning in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) relies on the instrumental variable method of Mendelian Randomization (MR). Currently, an over-whelming number of MR studies purport to show causal relationships among a wide range of risk factors and outcomes. Here, we find that naive application of many recently proposed MR approaches results in numerous null relationships being discovered as highly significant. We show that a well-controlled error rate can be achieved through a graphical inference approach which: (i) selects a set of genetic instrumental variables (IVs) from GWAS summary static controlling for LD, linkage and pleiotropy; (ii) accommodates rare variants and binary outcomes in a principled way; (iii) distinguishes direct from indirect risk factors in very high-dimensional data; and (iv) identifies potential unobserved latent confounding. Only 20 minutes of wall-clock compute time is required for our Causal Inference GWAS (CI-GWAS) approach to jointly analyze a set of 9 common health risk factors, four common complex metabolic disease outcomes and 8.4M genetic variants recorded for 458,747 individuals in the UK Biobank. Genome-wide, we find that very few genetic variants are suitable MR IVs, with only 696 variants remaining when analyzing all traits jointly. While we replicate almost all paths previously found by CAUSE between risk factors and outcomes, we show that only few of these reflect direct adjacencies and that many cannot be distinguished from unmeasured confounding within the UK Biobank data. Our results suggest that well-curated longitudinal records and family data are likely needed to overcome the mixtures of temporal precedence and reverse-causality in biobank data. Our approach provides a first-step toward robust principled screening for potential causal links to understand the underlying nature of phenotypic correlations in biobank data."
"This study reports on the outcomes of a formal peer-learning program for undergraduate science students. We implemented a cohort-based study buddy program in which high-scoring students (mentors) and lower-scoring peers (proteges) were invited to form study groups based on their first assessment scores in a given course. We then compared the performance of participants versus non-participants on subsequent assessments, while examining separately the effects for mentors and proteges. Results showed similar participation benefits for students in both mentor and protege roles. These findings emphasize the value of reducing barriers to collaborative learning in higher education and highlight the study buddy program as a cost-effective and scalable approach to enhance students educational experiences."
"INTRODUCTIONBasal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) are integral to learning, attention, and memory, and are prone to degeneration in Down syndrome (DS), Alzheimers disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms that lead to the degeneration of these neurons are not known.

METHODSSingle-nucleus gene expression and ATAC sequencing were performed on postmortem human basal forebrain from unaffected control and DS tissue samples at 0-2 years of age (n=4 each).

RESULTSSequencing analysis of postmortem human basal forebrain identifies gene expression differences in DS early in life. Genes encoding proteins associated with energy metabolism pathways, specifically oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, and genes encoding antioxidant enzymes are upregulated in DS BFCNs.

DISCUSSIONMultiomic analyses reveal that energy metabolism may be disrupted in DS BFCNs by birth. Increased oxidative phosphorylation and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species byproducts may be early contributors to DS BFCN neurodegeneration."
"Attention mechanisms guide visuomotor behavior by weighing physical salience and internal goals to prioritize stimuli as choices for action. Although less well studied, selection history, which reflects multiple facets of experience with recent events, is increasingly recognized as a distinct source of attentional bias. To examine how selection history impacts saccadic choices, we trained two macaque monkeys to perform an urgent version of an oddball search task in which a red target appeared among three green distracters, or vice versa. By imposing urgency, performance could be tracked continuously as it transitioned from uninformed guesses to informed choices as a function of processing time. This, in turn, permitted assessment of attentional control as manifest in motor biases, processing speed, and asymptotic accuracy. Here, we found that the probability of making a correct choice was strongly modulated by the histories of preceding target locations and target colors. Crucially, although both effects were gated by success (or reward), their dynamics were clearly distinct: whereas location history promoted a motor bias, color history modulated perceptual sensitivity, and these influences acted independently. Thus, combined selection histories can give rise to enormous swings in visuomotor performance even in simple tasks with highly discriminable stimuli.

Impact statementDuring visual search, the choice of where to look next is biased to a remarkable degree by the location and color histories of recently viewed target stimuli."
"Increasing evidence suggests that attention varies rhythmically, phase-locked to ongoing cortical oscillations. Here, we report that the phase of theta oscillations (3-6 Hz) in the frontal eye field (FEF) is associated with temporal and spatial variation of the read-out of information from working memory (WM). Non-human primates were briefly shown a sample array of colored squares. A short time later, they viewed a test array and were rewarded for identifying which square changed color (the target). Better performance (accuracy and reaction time) varied systematically with the phase of local field potential (LFP) theta at the time of test array onset as well as the targets location. This is consistent with theta ""scanning"" across the FEF and thus visual space from top to bottom. Theta was coupled, on opposing phases, to both spiking and beta (12-20 Hz). These results could be explained by a wave of activity that moves across the FEF, modulating the readout of information from WM."
"AbstractDifferentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) towards neuronal lineages has enabled diverse cellular models of human neurodevelopment and related disorders. However, in vitro differentiation is a variable process that frequently leads to heterogeneous cell populations that may confound disease-relevant phenotypes. Here, we report a thorough characterization of cortical neuron differentiation from iPSCs using joint profiling of neuronal morphology and transcriptomics in single cells. We assayed 60,000 developing neurons across three timepoints with CellPainting, a high-content imaging method, and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). By modeling the relationship between morphological features and gene expression within our differentiation system, we annotated image-based features with biological functions and found that while phenotypes related to cell morphology capture broader neuronal classes than scRNA-seq, they enhance our ability to quantify the biological processes that drive neuronal differentiation over time, such as mitochondrial function and cell cycle. Further, we found that while over 60% of the cells match those seen in the fetal brain, 28% represented metabolically abnormal cell states and broader neuronal classes specific to in vitro cells. Finally, we show that specific subtypes of iPSC-derived cortical neurons are a relevant model for a range of brain-related complex traits, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, highlighting the potential of multi-modal single cell phenotyping for disease modeling."
"Glottic insufficiency results from impaired vocal cord contact, leading to a gap between the cords and manifesting as hoarseness and respiratory difficulties. Vocal cord injection is a commonly utilized therapeutic approach to rectify this gap by augmenting vocal cord volume; however, the optimal injectable material remains undetermined. Dedifferentiated fat cells (DFATs), derived from mature adipocytes, exhibit robust proliferative capacity and multipotency, establishing them as potential candidates for treating glottic insufficiency. This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of DFATs in a rat model of recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. In the experimental design, the recurrent laryngeal nerve of each rat was resected unilaterally, and 5 weeks later, the atrophied vocal cord muscles were injected with either 10 l of saline (control), 1.0 x 106 DFATs in 10 l (DFAT group), or 1.0 x 106 DFATs combined with 500 ng of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in 10 l (DFAT + bFGF group). At 4 weeks post-injection, laryngeal endoscopy was performed to evaluate the glottic gap, followed by histological analyses to assess vocal muscle atrophy, collagen deposition, and markers of cellular proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptosis (TUNEL). To confirm DFAT engraftment, GFP-labeled DFATs were evaluated at 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-injection. Results indicated that both the DFAT and DFAT + bFGF groups exhibited significantly reduced glottic gaps, increased collagen deposition, and decreased TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells compared to controls. Notably, the DFAT + bFGF group displayed superior outcomes, including a greater vocal muscle area and enhanced Ki-67-positive cell proliferation, indicating mitigation of muscle atrophy. GFP-positive DFATs were detectable in the tissue for up to 6 weeks, confirming engraftment. These findings underscore the potential of DFATs, particularly in combination with bFGF, as an innovative and effective therapeutic approach for glottic insufficiency secondary to recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis."
"Understanding how species adapt to changing environments is a major goal in evolutionary biology and can elucidate the impact of climate change. Climate imposes inevitable effects on the geographical distribution of insects as their body temperature primarily depends on the environment. The vinegar fly Drosophila ananassae expanded from its tropical ancestral range to more temperate regions, which requires adaptation to colder temperatures. Transcriptome and genome-wide association studies focusing on the ancestral-range population identified the targets of selection related to ionoregulatory tissues. However, how cosmopolitan D. ananassae adapted to colder environments, where low temperatures last longer, is still unknown. Here, we present a study on the effect of long-term cold exposure on D. ananassae, examining the gene expression variation in the whole body and the ionoregulatory tissues, namely the hindgut and the Malpighian tubule. To elucidate molecular mechanisms of cold adaptation during species expansion, we included cold-tolerant and cold-sensitive strains from the ancestral species range and cold-tolerant strains from the derived species range. We show that cold acclimation improves cold tolerance and results in differential expression of more than half of the transcriptome in the ionoregulatory tissues and the whole body. Notably, we provide complementary insight into molecular processes at four levels: strains, populations, phenotypes, and tissues. By determining the biochemical pathways of phenotypic plasticity underlying cold tolerance, our results enhance our understanding of how environmental changes affect thermal adaptation in natural populations.

SignificanceThe physiological mechanisms underlying cold tolerance of insects are complex. Our study integrates tissue-specific responses with whole-body response to cold and compares these responses in different populations, phenotypes, and strains of the vinegar fly Drosophila ananassae. The study reveals that the response to extended cold in the renal and intestinal tissues are different, that the tissue-specific responses can be masked in the whole body, and that the transcriptomic response to extended cold can depend on population of origin, cold tolerance phenotype, or strain. Overall, this study sheds light on insect cold adaptation in terms of transcriptomic response to cold acclimation in the ionoregulatory tissues and whole bodies."
"This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of MMseqs2 clusters and traditional machine learning (ML) clustering algorithms, including KMeans and Hierarchical clusterings, in terms of protein sequences. The analyses are validated experimentally. The cluster analyses have been performed in the AO_SCPLOWSTRALC_SCPLOW Compendium protein sequences dataset hosted in the SCOPe database. The dataset is embedded using two pre-trained transformer models using Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM) to perform KMeans and Hierarchical clustering algorithms. Afterward, those four clusters are compared with MMseqs2/Linclust and MMseqs2/easy-cluster methods. After performing the experiment, MMseqs2/Linclust and MMseqs2/easy-cluster outperform traditional machine learning cluster algorithms by a considerable margin. This analysis demonstrates the superiority of the MMseqs2 clustering techniques over conventional machine learning clustering algorithms. The source code of the experiment is publicly available and readily accessible through: https://github.com/mrzResearchArena/protein-clustering."
"Understanding intelligence-related variations in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity requires advanced mathematical approaches capable of capturing geometric transformations and long-range dependencies in neural dynamics. These approaches may provide methodological advantages over conventional spectral and connectivity-based techniques by offering deeper insights into the structural and functional organization of neural networks. In this study, we integrate Clifford algebra, Noethers theorem and fractional calculus to analyze EEG signals from high- and low-IQ individuals, looking for key intelligence-related differences in cortical organization. Clifford algebra enables the representation of EEG signals as multivectors, preserving both magnitude and directional relationships across cortical regions. Noethers theorem provides a quantitative measure of symmetry properties linked to spectral features, identifying conserved functional patterns across distinct brain regions. Mittag-Leffler functions, derived from fractional calculus, characterize long-range dependencies in neural oscillations, allowing for the detection of memory effects and scale-invariant properties often overlooked by traditional methods. We found significant differences between high- and low-IQ individuals in geometric trajectories, hemispheric connectivity, spectral properties and fractional-order dynamics. High-IQ individuals exhibited increased spectral asymmetry, enhanced spectral differentiation, distinct geometric trajectories and greater fractional connectivity, particularly in frontal and central regions. In contrast, low-IQ individuals displayed more uniform hemispheric connectivity and heightened fractional activity in occipital areas. Mittag-Leffler fractional exponents further indicated that high-IQ individuals possessed more varied neural synchronization patterns. Overall, our multi-faceted approach suggests that intelligence-related neural dynamics are characterized by an asymmetric, functionally specialized and fractionally complex cortical organization. This results in significant differences in network topology, efficiency, modularity and long-range dependencies."
"Mitochondria, the double membrane-bound organelles of endosymbiotic origin, are crucial centers for cellular energy production and several essential metabolic pathways. Recent studies reveal that mitochondria become dysfunctional following numerous cellular stresses, and during pathologies, demanding an extensive investigation of mitochondrial turnover mechanisms. Apart from the specific response pathways to tackle different stresses, mitophagy or degradation of mitochondria by autophagy is a critical quality control mechanism that clears irreversibly damaged mitochondria. Mitophagy is majorly executed either by receptor-mediated or PINK1-Parkin-dependent pathways. Here, we show that the human orthologue of yeast Vms1, ANKZF1, participates in PINK-Parkin-mediated mitophagy. We show that ANKZF1 is extensively recruited to damaged mitochondria along with Parkin during mitochondrial proteotoxic stress induced by the expression of a single misfolded/aggregated protein or during uncoupler-induced membrane depolarization. Importantly, ANKZF1 recruitment to damaged mitochondria is significantly enhanced in the presence of Parkin, and ANKZF1 physically interacts with Parkin and LC3 during mitochondrial proteotoxic or depolarization stresses. ANKZF1 harbors six putative LC3-interacting regions (LIRs), LIR4 present at residues 333-336 is particularly important for ANKZF1-LC3 interaction. Furthermore, we show that ANKZF1 knockout cells are compromised in clearing stress-damaged mitochondria by mitophagy, indicating an important role of ANKZF1 in mitochondrial turnover during stress. In summary, we show a new role of ANKZF1 in eliminating the stress-damaged mitochondria, reiterating the mito-protective role of Vms1/ANKZF1 during mitochondrial stresses."
"Antibodies to human papillomavirus (HPV) primarily recognize surface exposed residues on five loops of the major capsid protein (L1) that vary significantly among HPV types. We determined which loops were required for neutralization for 70 HPV16 specific human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cloned from participants who received an HPV vaccine, and we describe molecular features of those antibodies.

Chimeric HPV16 pseudovirus (cpsV), each having one surface loop bearing multiple amino acid substitutions, were used to determine neutralization specificity. The HPV16-FG-loop was the loop most frequently required for neutralization (44 of 70, 62.9%), however, all other surface loops were used for neutralization by multiple mAbs: HI (13, 18.6%), DE (15, 21.4%), EF (six, 8.6%), BC (four, 5.7%). Antibodies that required multiple loops were common (17, 24.3%). Three mAbs (4.3%) required sequences on the c-terminus of L1 and for another three mAbs the neutralization specificity could not be determined.

Two types of mAbs appeared to be overrepresented: ten mAbs used VH 2-70 IGHV paired with VL {lambda}1-40, having characteristic mutations in complementarity determining region two (CDRL2). Cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) revealed that two of these antibodies bound five Fabs per pentamer interacting with all five L1-surface loops. The other type of mAbs that appeared to be overrepresented were ten mAbs using VH 4-34, seven of which also used DH3-16*02 with conserved CDRH3 sequences. Cryo-EM for one of these mAbs, that required the FG-loop for neutralization, was shown to bind one Fab per pentamer at the apex, interacting with the DE- and FG-loops, with sequences of the Fab CDRH3 inserted between the DE- and FG-loops from two protomers. These two types of mAbs were found repeatedly in the four participants suggesting that these antibodies shared developmental pathways and bound to similar immunodominant epitopes on the virus.

HighlightsMost human mAbs recognized L1 surface loops but three of 70 recognized sequences on the C-terminal arm of L1

Some antibodies induced by HPV vaccination follow shared developmental pathways.

Human monoclonal antibodies using VH 2-70/VL {lambda}1-40 were found in all participants and bound with at a stoichiometry of five Fabs per capsomer.

Human monoclonal antibodies using the diversity gene segment D3-16*02 were found in all participants and one Fab was shown to bind with a stoichiometry of one Fab per capsomer.

In briefA panel of 70 HPV16 specific human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), cloned from memory B cells or plasmablasts following HPV vaccination, was characterized by determining the surface loops of the major capsid protein (L1) required for neutralization and examined for shared molecular features. All five L1 loops were found to be used for neutralization by one or more antibodies, but the most frequent target of these antibodies was the FG loop followed by the HI and DE loops. Ten antibodies paired the heavy chain variable gene VH 2-70 with the light chain variable gene VL {lambda}1-40 and these antibodies had conserved mutations in the CDRL2 region of VL {lambda}1-40. Mutating the CDRL2 back to the predicted germline sequence significantly reduced neutralization. Cryo-EM analysis of two VH2-70/VL{lambda}1-40 mAbs showed five Fabs binding per L1 pentamer and a conserved epitope with Fabs interacting with all five variable loops across two adjacent protomers. Seven other mAbs had a heavy chain composed of the variable region VH4-34 with the diversity gene D3-16*02 resulting in the sequence motif WSGYR in the CDRH3. Mutation of that sequence to alanine ablated HPV16 neutralization activity. A cryo-EM structure of one of these antibodies showed one Fab binding the pentamer apex with the WSGYR motif inserting between three loops from two protomers. Antibodies with paired VH 2-70/VL {lambda}1-40 and the antibodies with CDRH3 containing the WSGYR sequence, were found in all four study participants suggesting that such antibodies may be commonly elicited following HPV vaccination."
"Optimizing nitrogen (N) utilization in ruminant production systems holds both economic and environmental significance. However, traditional paradigms of N metabolism, derived primarily from well-studied model rumen bacteria, cannot fully capture the diverse and complex N metabolic dynamics within the rumen ecosystem. To address this gap, we utilized comparative genomics and genome-resolved multi-omics analyses using a curated set of microbial genomes to investigate N assimilation and regulation in rumen microbes. We discovered that canonical mechanism of ammonia assimilation and regulation, such as the glutamine synthetase (GS)/glutamate synthase (GOGAT) pathways and its regulatory proteins, are absent in the genomes of many key and predominant rumen microbes, which likely utilize alternative pathways for ammonia assimilation. These findings challenge the applicability of E. coli-based N regulation models to rumen bacteria. We further linked polysaccharide utilization and ammonia assimilation across hundreds of rumen microbial species. Furthermore, we identified specific microbial species involved in ureolysis and denitrification, as well as phages carrying auxiliary metabolic genes that perform N assimilation. Using an animal trial involving 11 pairs of lamb twins in a crossover design, we demonstrated that dietary crude protein (CP) concentrations had minimal impact on rumen microbiome composition and expression of N assimilation genes. Instead, shifts in concentrate levels triggered alterations in N assimilation, including increased expression of amino acid biosynthesis pathways. These findings indicate a nuanced, species-specific microbial response to dietary interventions, highlighting the limitations of traditional N metabolism models applied to rumen microbes and the need for more granular studies of rumen microbial ecosystems."
"Microbes can be programmed to record participation in gene transfer by coding biological-recording devices into mobile DNA. Upon DNA uptake, these devices transcribe a catalytic RNA (cat-RNA) that binds to conserved sequences within ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and perform a trans-splicing reaction that adds a barcode to the rRNA. Existing cat-RNA designs were manually generated to be broad-host range, providing no control over the organisms that were barcoded. To achieve control over the organisms barcoded by cat-RNA, we created a program called Ribodesigner that uses input sets of rRNA sequences to create designs with varying specificities. We show how this algorithm can be used to identify designs that enable kingdom-wide barcoding, or selective barcoding of specific taxonomic groups within a kingdom. We use Ribodesigner to create cat-RNA designs that target Pseudomonadales while avoiding Enterobacterales, and we compare the performance of one design to a cat-RNA that was previously found to be broad host range. When conjugated into a mixture of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, the new design presents increased selectivity compared to a broad host range cat-RNA. Ribodesigner is expected to aid in developing cat-RNA that store information within user-defined sets of microbes in environmental communities for gene transfer studies.

"BackgroundWe recently demonstrated that single-pulse TMS of the primary sensorimotor hand area (SM1HAND) elicits an immediate transcranial evoked potential (iTEP). This iTEP response appears within 2-7 ms post-TMS, featuring high-frequency peaks superimposed on a slow positive wave. Here, we used a linear TMS-EEG mapping approach to characterize the rostro-caudal iTEP expression and compared it to that of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs).

MethodsIn 15 healthy young volunteers (9 females), we identified the iTEP hotspot in left SM1HAND. We applied single biphasic TMS pulses at an intensity of 110% of resting motor threshold over six cortical sites along a rostro-caudal axis (2 cm rostral to 3 cm caudal to the SM1HAND hotspot). We analyzed site-specific iTEP and MEP responses.

ResultsiTEP magnitude decreased rostrally and caudally from the SM1HAND hotspot. MEPs exhibited a similar rostro-caudal crescendo-decrescendo pattern. While iTEP and MEP response profiles were similar, normalized iTEP amplitudes decayed less rapidly at the first postcentral site.

DiscussionThese findings support the idea that pericentral iTEPs reflect a direct response signature of the pericentral cortex, possibly involving a synchronized TMS-induced excitation of cortical pyramidal tract neurons. Similar but non-identical rostro-caudal patterns suggest that iTEPs and MEPs may arise from overlapping but distinct neuronal populations."
"Moderate to severe head pain is a hallmark of recurring migraine attacks. However, it is challenging to study patients during spontaneous attacks and most research on the brain mechanisms of pain in migraine patients has been limited to the processing of painful stimuli between attacks. Here, we hypothesize that the experience of a migraine attack extends beyond the response to painful stimuli and is associated with specific impairments of the salience network (SN), which integrates sensory, emotional and cognitive information in relation to salient stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the SN dynamics of a group of patients with episodic migraine in three distinct conditions: at rest during a spontaneous migraine attack (ictal phase); while performing an imagery task aiming to elicit the experience of a previous attack, during the interictal phase; and at rest, during the interictal phase. For comparison, we also studied a group of healthy controls in three matching conditions, including rest as well as an imagery task of a (non-migraine) head pain experience. We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and used a dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis to examine the temporal features of the SN from a total of 78 samples. Compared to healthy controls, the SN had a significantly shorter lifetime in patients during the pain imagery task, but not during a migraine attack or interictal resting state. Our results support the disruption of the SN in migraine, and indicate that pain imagery may be a useful paradigm for isolating the emotional and cognitive aspects of pain and investigating SN dynamics."
"Gene-level rare variant association tests (RVATs) are essential for uncovering disease mechanisms and identifying potential drug targets. Advances in sequence-based machine learning have expanded the availability of variant pathogenicity scores, offering new opportunities to improve variant prioritization for RVATs. However, existing methods often rely on rigid models or analyze single annotations in isolation, limiting their ability to leverage these advances. To address this, we introduce BayesRVAT, a Bayesian framework for RVATs that models variant effects using multiple annotations. By specifying priors on variant effects and estimating gene-trait-specific burden scores through variational inference, BayesRVAT flexibly accommodates diverse genetic architectures. In simulations, BayesRVAT improved power while maintaining statistical calibration. When applied to real data from the UK Biobank, BayesRVAT detected 10.2% more associations with blood traits than the next-best method and uncovered novel gene-disease associations in analyses of eight disease traits, including a link between PRPH2 and retinal disease. These results highlight BayesRVATs potential to enhance rare variant discovery and improve gene-trait association studies."
"Admixture between populations is a common feature of human history. Admixture events introduce new genetic variation that can fuel evolution. Characterizing the significance of admixture events on the evolution of a population across various species is of great interest to evolutionary geneticists. Local Ancestry Inference (LAI) methods infer genetic ancestry of an individual at a particular chromosomal location. Certain methods specialize in detecting archaic introgression, which consists of interbreeding between modern and archaic humans like Neanderthals and Denisovans. Most current LAI methods allow the detection of a single archaic ancestry, and post-processing may distinguish between multiple waves of introgression. These methods vary in how they choose archaic or modern reference genomes for the inference. Here, we present a new HMM-based method (DAIseg), which has the advantage of simultaneously distinguishing between multiple waves of ancient and recent admixture, using only modern human reference genomes. Simulations demonstrate that DAIseg achieves higher overall performance than state-of-the-art methods. We also apply DAIseg to Papuan populations to jointly detect Denisovan and Neanderthal introgressed segments, and identify a higher number of archaic segments than previous methods. Analysis of inferred introgressed segments, shows that we can identify evidence for two Denisovan introgression events in Papuans without having any post-processing and filtering. Overall, on top of being able to deal with both Archaic and recent admixture, DAIseg provides a more principled approach for detecting and classifying Denisovan and Neanderthal segments which will improve downstream analysis of introgressed segments to infer the impact of archaic introgression in humans."
"The heterogeneity in both the neurobiological mechanisms and the phenotypic presentation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) poses a major challenge to clinical and translational research. Early inefficiencies in functional connectivity (FC) have been associated with ASD, yet it remains unclear whether and how abnormal brain network properties may account for individual differences across ASD-related symptomatology and behaviors. We applied source-level reconstruction to resting-state high-definition EEG data in a cohort of 113 young children (40 with ASD) to identify early global and local alterations of cortical network connectivity. We subsequently used regularized canonical correlation analysis (rCCA) to characterize specific FC patterns linked to variation in cognitive, social and sensory dimensions within the autism spectrum. We found increased low-frequency FC in frontotemporal cross-hemispheric networks and lateral-occipital regions of young ASD children. RCCA revealed three distinct FC patterns in recurrent ASD-related networks, each contributing to predict individual differences in cognitive, social and sensory features. These linked FC-behavior dimensions may shed light on atypical brain network topology conferring risk for specific phenotypic manifestations of ASD, which may implicate unique underlying neurobiological mechanisms."
"DNA methylation (DNAm) has been shown to mediate causal effects from traumatic experiences to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the scientific question about whether the mediation effect changes over time remains unclear. In this paper, we develop time-varying structural equation models to identify cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites where DNAm mediates the effect of trauma exposure on PTSD, and to capture dynamic changes in mediation effects. The proposed methodology is motivated by the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study (DNHS) with high-dimensional and longitudinal DNAm measurements. To handle the non-monotone missing DNAm in the dataset, we propose a novel Longitudinal Multiple Imputation (LMI) method utilizing dependency among repeated measurements, and employ the generalized method of moments to integrate the multiple imputations. Simulations confirm that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in various longitudinal settings. In DNHS data analysis, our method identifies several CpG sites where DNAm exhibits dynamic mediation effects. Some of the corresponding genes have been shown to be associated with PTSD in the existing literature, and our findings on their time-varying effects could deepen the understanding of the mediation role of DNAm on the causal path from trauma exposure to PTSD risk."
"Adaptive chaos represents a paradigm shift in understanding biological systems, where mild chaotic dynamics sustain homeostasis and resilience. This study delves into oxygen-ozone therapys ability to leverage adaptive chaos in treating spinal musculoskeletal disorders, particularly intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). Employing mathematical modelling and bioinformatic tools, the study evaluates chaos, complexity, and entropy across varying ozone doses to identify optimal therapeutic windows within a hormetic range. The results reveal that lower ozone doses (20-40 {micro}g/ml O3) promote adaptive chaos, enhancing systemic complexity, reducing inflammatory cytokines, and fostering structural repair. Conversely, higher doses (60-80 {micro}g/ml O3) induce excessive oxidative stress, exacerbating pathological chaos and impairing recovery. The integration of Shannon entropy, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions provides a novel framework for quantifying therapeutic outcomes. Findings highlight the role of controlled perturbations in stabilizing pathological systems, offering a dose-dependent roadmap for balancing flexibility and order. By correlating modelled insights with clinical evidence, the study underscores the significance of precision dosing, as the optimal range facilitates pain reduction and inflammatory control, correlating with improved complexity and reduced turbulence. This research pioneers the concept of adaptive chaos in medical interventions, emphasizing its translational potential for personalized and systemic medicine. Beyond IVDD, the findings establish a broader framework for adaptive chaos as a cornerstone of health restoration, advocating for therapies that optimize biological complexity. This work tries to bridge mathematical modelling and clinical evidence, offering a cutting-edge perspective on regenerative medicine and chaos-driven therapeutic strategies."
"Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset disease caused by modest alanine expansion at the amino terminus of the nuclear polyadenosine RNA binding protein PABPN1. PABPN1 is expressed ubiquitously and is involved in multiple steps in RNA processing including optimal cleavage and polyadenylation, polyadenylation signal selection, and export of polyadenylated RNAs from the nucleus. Expanded PABPN1 forms aggregates in a subset of muscle nuclei, but PABPN1 levels are paradoxically low in muscle compared to other tissues. Despite several studies in model systems and patient tissues, it remains unclear whether alanine expansion directly impairs PABPN1 function. The molecular mechanisms leading to OPMD pathology are poorly understood. Here we used a proximity labeling approach to better understand the effect of alanine expansion on PABPN1 function in a cell culture model of skeletal muscle. To avoid the confounding factor of overexpression, PABPN1 constructs containing a carboxy-terminal TurboID tag were expressed in skeletal myotubes at near native levels using an inducible promoter. Although non-expanded PABPN1-TurboID was able to complement RNA export and myoblast differentiation defects caused by deficiency of endogenous PABPN1, alanine expanded PABPN1-TurboID was not. Comparative proteomics revealed increased interaction between expanded PABPN1 and RNA splicing and polyadenylation machinery and follow-up studies identified a dominant negative effect on RNA export in differentiated myotubes. These data indicate that alanine expansion can impair PABPN1 function regardless of the presence of wild type PABPN1 and support a model wherein both loss function and dominant negative effects of expanded PABPN1 contribute to OPMD pathology.

Author summaryOculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late onset muscle disease that, unlike other muscular dystrophies, causes progressive weakness primarily in muscles of the face and head. OPMD is most commonly inherited in a dominant fashion and is caused by small expansions in the gene encoding the RNA binding protein PABPN1. Despite the fact that PABPN1 is expressed ubiquitously and contributes to multiple steps in RNA processing, its expansion causes disease almost exclusively in skeletal muscle. The precise molecular events leading to OPMD disease onset have been difficult to characterize as it is challenging to separate functions expanded versus non-expanded PABPN1 in muscle without the confounding factor of overexpressing tagged fusion proteins. Here we fused expanded and non-expanded PABPN1 to the modified biotin ligase TurboID to label proximal proteins. PABPN1-TurboID fusions were expressed in a cell culture model of skeletal muscle at near-native levels. Using these constructs, we discovered that expanded PABPN1 is less functional than non-expanded PABPN1 and causes dominant negative effects on some PABPN1 functions. These findings support a model where both loss of function and dominant negative effects contribute to the molecular pathology of OPMD."
"The brain can be conceptualized as a control system facilitating transitions between states, such as from rest to motor activity. Applying network control theory to measurements of brain signals enables characterization of brain dynamics through control properties. However, most prior studies that have applied network control theory have evaluated brain dynamics under unperturbed conditions, neglecting the critical role of external perturbations in accurate system identification. In this study, we combine a perturbation input paradigm with a network control theory framework and propose a novel method for estimating the controllability Gramian matrix in a simple, theoretically grounded manner. This method provides insights into brain dynamics, including overall controllability (quantified by the Gramians eigenvalues) and specific controllable directions (represented by its eigenvectors). As a proof of concept, we applied our method to transcranial magnetic stimulationinduced electroencephalographic responses across four motor-related states and two resting states. We found that states such as open-eye rest, closed-eye rest, and motor-related states were more effectively differentiated using controllable directions than overall controllability. However, certain states, like motor execution and motor imagery, remained indistinguishable using these measures. These findings indicate that some brain states differ in their intrinsic control properties as dynamical systems, while others share similarities that make them less distinguishable. This study underscores the value of control theory-based analyses in quantitatively how intrinsic brain states shape the brains responses to stimulation, providing deeper insights into the dynamic properties of these states. This methodology holds promise for diverse applications, including characterizing individual response variability and identifying conditions for optimal stimulation efficacy.

Significant statementThe brain can be viewed as a control system transitioning between states, such as from rest to motor activity. Previous studies using network control theory mostly evaluated brain dynamics without external perturbations, neglecting their role in accurate system identification. This study integrates perturbation inputs with network control theory to propose a method for estimating the controllability Gramian, thereby providing insights into brain dynamics. We applied this approach to TMS-induced EEG responses in motor-related and resting states. Our findings show that controllable directions (eigenvectors) allow better discrimination between states than overall controllability. Our method can quantitatively assess brain state differences, and has potential applications in characterizing individual response variability and optimizing stimulation efficacy."
"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a multifactorial disease involving genetic and environmental factors, including viral infection. We investigated the impact of interferon alpha (IFN-), a cytokine produced during the immune response to viral infection or the presence of un-edited endogenous double-stranded RNAs, on human {beta}-cell physiology. Intravital microscopy on transplanted human islets using a {beta}-cell-selective reactive oxygen species (ROS) biosensor (RIP1-GRX1-roGFP2), revealed a subset of human {beta}-cells that acutely produce ROS in response to IFN-. Comparison to Integrated Islet Distribution Program (IIDP) phenotypic data revealed that healthier donors had more ROS accumulating cells. In vitro IFN- treatment of human islets similarly elicited a heterogenous increase in superoxide production that originated in the mitochondria. To determine the unique molecular signature predisposing cells to IFN- stimulated ROS production, we flow sorted human islets treated with IFN-. RNA sequencing identified genes involved in inflammatory and immune response in the ROS-producing cells. Comparison with single cell RNA-Seq datasets available through the Human Pancreas Analysis Program (HPAP) showed that genes upregulated in ROS-producing cells are enriched in control {beta}-cells rather than T1D donors. Combined, these data suggest that IFN- stimulates mitochondrial ROS production in healthy human {beta}-cells, potentially predicting a more efficient antiviral response."
"When compared to nature sounds, exposure to mechanical sounds evokes higher levels of perceptual and physiological arousal, prompting the recruitment of attentional and physiological resources to elicit adaptive responses. However, it is unclear whether these attributes are solely related to the sound intensity of mechanical sounds, since in most real-world scenarios, mechanical sounds are present at high intensities, or if other acoustic or semantic factors are also at play. We measured the Skin Conductance Response (SCR), reflecting sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity as well as the pleasantness and eventfulness of the soundscape across two passive and active listening tasks in (N = 25) healthy subjects. The auditory stimuli were divided into two categories, nature, and mechanical sounds, and were manipulated to vary in three perceived loudness levels. As expected, we found that the sound category influenced perceived soundscape pleasantness and eventfulness. SCR was analysed by taking the mean level across the stimulus epoch, and also by quantifying its dynamic. We found that mean SCR was modulated by loudness only. SCR rise-time (a measure of speed of the skin response) correlated significantly with soundscape pleasantness and eventfulness for nature and mechanical sounds. This study highlights the importance of considering both loudness level and sound category in evaluating the perceptual soundscape, highlighting SCR as a valuable tool for such assessments.

Impact statementLoud mechanical sounds are considered more unpleasant than nature sounds. This study examined whether loudness alone causes this effect or if the type of sound (e.g., mechanical vs. Nature) also plays a role. By measuring skin conductance reflecting the automatic and unconscious activation of the bodys autonomic system, we found that physical reactions are driven by loudness but also correlate with the listeners judgement of the pleasantness and eventfulness (describing the perceived level of activity or stimulation) of a soundscape."
"Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that poses a continued and increasing threat to public health. A promising strategy to mitigate the burden of DENV is introgression of the virus-inhibiting Wolbachia pipientis bacterium into Aedes aegypti populations in the field. While previous studies on Wolbachia-mediated virus inhibition have typically assessed viral replication following a single bloodmeal, the main vector of DENV, Ae. aegypti, feeds frequently, often biting multiple hosts per gonotrophic cycle and promptly attempting to refeed following egg laying. Previously, we demonstrated that successive blood feeding reduces the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) and shortens the time it takes for a mosquito to be able to transmit viruses to a new host. With this in mind, we investigated the impact of successive blood meals on DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) in Ae. aegypti in the presence or absence of Wolbachia (wAlbB and wMelM). We found that both WT and Wolbachia transinfected had increased DENV-2 dissemination 7 days post-infection as well as higher body titers of DENV-2 in the double-fed groups. Using these empirical data in a binomial regression model, we estimated that successive feeding increased the probability of WT and Wolbachia transinfected mosquitoes surviving the EIP. When we estimated the odds of surviving the EIP for mosquitoes with Wolbachia relative to WT mosquitoes, successive feeding increased the chances of WT mosquitoes surviving the EIP more than in mosquitoes with Wolbachia, indicating a strong inhibitory effect of Wolbachia even in the context of natural frequent blood feeding behavior. Our work shows that mosquito feeding behavior should be considered when assessing the inhibitory effects of Wolbachia on DENV."
"Chloroplasts are major photosynthetic and protein-containing organelles in green plants and algae. Unwanted chloroplast proteins and entire chloroplasts are cleared through various degradation pathways including autophagy. Nevertheless, canonical chlorophagy receptors remain unidentified, and whether and to what extent chlorophagy can be enhanced to benefect the plants remain unknown. Here we designed and validated a synthetic chloroplast autophagy receptor using biochemical, genetical, and imaging approaches. This synthetic receptor, LIR-SNT-BFP, was constructed by fusing a fragment containing the LC3-interacting region (LIR) of the selective autophagy receptor NBR1 and the N-terminal amphipathic -helix of the chloroplast outer envelope protein SFR2. The fusion protein LIR-SNT-BFP coated the chloroplast and attracted ATG8a in planta. Upon induction, the synthetic receptor elicited vacuole-mediated microautophagy of entire chloroplasts independent of the ATG8 conjugation machinery proteins ATG5 or ATG7. Meanwhile, it induced chloroplast division; however the induced chlorophagy was independent of PDV2. Notably, moderate chlorophagy improves rosette growth, but excessive levels are detrimental. Furthermore, induced chlorophagy partially protects against herbicide-induced leaf chlorosis. This study demonstrates controlled chloroplast degradation using a synthetic chlorophagy receptor."
"BackgroundIn vertebrate embryogenesis, cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) migrate along discrete pathways. Analyses in the chick have identified key molecular candidates for the confinement of CNCC migration to stereotypical pathways as Colec12, Trail, and Dan. The effects of these factors on CNCCs in vitro are known, but how they confine migration to discrete streams in vivo remains poorly-understood. Here, we propose and test several hypothetical mechanisms by which these factors confine cell streams and maintain coherent migration, simulating an expanded agent-based model for collective CNCC migration.

ResultsModel simulations suggest that Trail enhances adhesion between CNCCs, facilitating movement towards stereotypical migratory pathways, whereas Colec12 confines CNCCs by inducing longer, branched filopodia that facilitate movement down Colec12 gradients and re-connections with streams. Moreover, we find that Trail and Colec12 facilitate the exchange of CNCCs and formation of CNCC-bridges between adjacent streams that are observed in vivo but poorly-understood mechanistically. Finally, we predict that Dan increases the coherence of streams by preferentially modulating the speed of CNCCs at the leading edge of collectives to prevent escape.

ConclusionsOur work highlights the importance of Trail, Colec12, and Dan in CNCC migration and predicts novel mechanisms for the confinement of CNCCs to stereotypical pathways in vivo."
"Single-cell spatial transcriptomics enables precise mapping of cellular states and functional domains within their native tissue environment. These functional domains often exist at multiple spatial scales, with larger domains encompassing smaller ones, reflecting the hierarchical organization of biological systems. However, the identification of these functional domain hierarchies has been hardly explored due to the lack of appropriate computational methods. In this work, we present SCALE, an unsupervised algorithm for multi-scale domain identification in spatial transcriptomics data. SCALE combines neural graph representation learning with an entropy-based search algorithm to detect functional domains at different scales. It reaches state-of-the-art performance in single- and multi-scale domain detection on simulated and murine brain Xenium and MERFISH data, as well as patient-derived kidney tissue, highlighting its robustness and scalability across diverse tissue types and platforms. SCALEs ease of use makes it a powerful aid for advancing our understanding of tissue organization and function in health and disease."
"Bactrocera zonata is a highly invasive agricultural pest that causes extensive damage to fruit crops. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), a species-specific and environmentally friendly pest control method, depends on the availability of Genetic Sexing Strains (GSSs) to enable efficient mass production of males for sterile release. However, no GSS currently exists for B. zonata limiting SIT applications targeting this important invasive pest. Here, we report two key advancements toward GSS development in this species. First, we present a high-quality, chromosome-level genome assembly from male B. zonata, identifying two scaffolds derived from the Y chromosome, which represent potential targets for future male-specific genetic engineering. Second, we demonstrate the feasibility of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in B. zonata by generating stable, homozygous white-eye mutants through targeted disruption of the conserved white-eye gene. This visible, recessive phenotype serves as a proof-of-concept for developing selectable markers in this species. Together, these results provide foundational genomic and genetic tools to support the development of GSSs in B. zonata, advancing the potential for sustainable, genetics-based pest control strategies."
"Macrophage phagocytosis is an essential immune response that eliminates pathogens, antibody-opsonized cancer cells and debris. Macrophages can also trogocytose, or nibble, targets. Trogocytosis and phagocytosis are often activated by the same signal, including IgG antibodies. What makes a macrophage trogocytose instead of phagocytose is not clear. Using both CD47 antibodies and a Her2 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) to induce phagocytosis, we found that macrophages preferentially trogocytose adherent target cells instead of phagocytose in both 2D cell monolayers and 3D cancer spheroid models. Disrupting target cell integrin using an RGD peptide or through CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of the V integrin subunit in target cells increased macrophage phagocytosis. Conversely, increasing cell adhesion by ectopically expressing E-Cadherin in Raji B cell targets reduced phagocytosis. Finally, we examined phagocytosis of mitotic cells, a naturally occurring example of cells with reduced adhesion. Arresting target cells in mitosis significantly increased phagocytosis. Together, our data show that target cell adhesion limits phagocytosis and promotes trogocytosis."
"Blood analysis is the most common in biomedical applications and a reference metabolome will be critical for effective annotation and for guiding scientific investigations. However, compiling such a reference is hindered by many technical challenges, despite the availability of large amount of metabolomics data today. Based on a new set of data structures and tools, we have assembled a consensus serum metabolome (CSM) from over 100,000 mass spectrometry acquisitions of more than 200 million spectra. This provides a comprehensive survey of human blood chemistry, revealing the frequency dependent nature of metabolome and exposome.

Major gaps are found between CSM and the current databases. The CSM enables community-level data alignment and significantly improves annotation quality of LC-MS metabolomics.

"BackgroundIn untargeted metabolomics studies, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is a powerful analytical platform. The fragmentation spectra produced can be used as ""molecular fingerprints"" to identify unknown metabolites. However, the high number of analytes that may be co-eluting limits the number of fragmentation spectra that can be collected and potentially identified, presenting a serious bottleneck for many studies. There is a need for new fragmentation strategies which are comprehensive, interpretable and robust, meaning they produce high-quality fragmentation spectra for as many analytes as possible while operating within the constraints of notoriously noisy mass spectrometry data.

ResultsWe present a data acquisition workflow which uses a bipartite graph to represent the relationship between opportunities for fragmentation and desired fragmentation targets. This method allows a schedule for data acquisition to be optimally allocated by a standard algorithm. We augment this existing technique by allowing it to solve for multiple samples collectively, allowing it to optimise target intensity (and hence spectral quality) via the use of a weighted matching and by assigning leftover scans redundantly to improve robustness. We also show how this workflow can be used flexibly to generate inclusion windows for Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) methods. Our experiments show that several thousand peaks identified in a realistic biological sample can be targeted using only two LC-MS/MS runs. We also further investigate the trade-off between offline workflows and DDA methods by exposing our target list of peaks to realistic variation across samples. We find in those circumstances that our new method has performance (measured by number of peaks targeted comparable to state-of-the-art DDA methods). However, this competitive performance is only possible with our additions to the base maximum matching technique, which provide extra resistance against inter-sample variations.

ConclusionsWe have proposed a workflow for LC-MS/MS data acquisition which can be used flexibly for entirely pre-scheduled acquisition or which may generate inclusion windows for online DDA methods. Our results show that the maximum matching workflow with our improvements is state-of-the-art where pre-scheduling is concerned, and in future this foundation may be developed to build more powerful DDA methods which can action the promise of truly comprehensive data acquisition."
"Fluorescence microscopy has become an indispensable tool in biological research, offering powerful approaches to study protein dynamics and molecular biochemistry in vivo. Among archaea, Haloferax volcanii has emerged as a particularly well-suited model organism for imaging studies, with a growing toolkit of established fluorescent markers, plasmids, and promoter systems. Recent advances in single-molecule imaging techniques have created new opportunities through WR806, a carotenoid-free strain providing reduced autofluorescence background. However, existing plasmid-based expression systems in WR806 show critical limitations in protein expression control and challenges with protein aggregation.

To address these limitations, we developed pUE001, a novel expression system specifically designed for WR806. This system achieves precise expression control by decoupling selection and induction through strategic implementation of the trpA selection marker. Through comprehensive characterization, we demonstrate that pUE001 provides superior control over protein expression compared to the previously established pTA962 system. It enables linear, titratable expression of diverse proteins -- from the highly regulated CRISPR-Cas component Cas1 to the abundant structural protein FtsZ1 -- while preventing protein aggregation that could compromise native cellular functions. Additionally, we performed a comprehensive analysis of WR806 to show that carotenoid depletion does not affect native cellular physiology. Finally, to demonstrate the systems utility, we investigated the role of Cas1 in UV-induced DNA repair using single-particle tracking photoactivated localization microscopy (sptPALM). Our findings reveal significant, dose-dependent changes in Cas1 mobility following UV-light induced damage, providing evidence for its involvement in DNA repair processes and offering new insights into the expanding roles of CRISPR-Cas systems beyond adaptive immunity."
"Metformin drug, widely used to treat type II diabetic patients, is a major pharmaceutical pollutant of wastewater and rivers. This environmental exposure has driven the evolution of bacteria, such as Aminobacter and Pseudomonas, to degrade metformin via a Ni{superscript 2}-dependent metformin hydrolase complex (MfmAB). Here we decipher the mechanism of acquisition and horizontal transfer of the mfmAB genes, initially mobilized from Aminobacter chromosomes to Pseudomonas conjugative plasmids via common transposable elements (IS1182 and IS3/IS6 elements) in composite transposons, carrying also other genes involved in guanylurea and biguanides degradation (guuH and bguH). These mobile elements, historically involved in acquisition of antibiotic-resistant genes from the environment before clonal expansion in clinical settings, now threaten to co-select for both metformin-degrading and antibiotic resistance genes in contaminated waters. This represents a global threat for diabetic patients with concurrent infections that should be urgently added in the roadmap of research in the context of One Health."
"Dietary environments can influence host-microbe evolution by shaping adaptive fitness responses. However, host-microbe dynamics on evolutionary time scales remain under-characterized. We studied Drosophila melanogaster experimentally evolved under three nutrient regimes: constant high (CH), deteriorating (DA), and fluctuating (FA) availability, alongside unselected controls (C). DA and FA increased longevity relative to CH, with DA enhancing late-life survival, though all selected groups showed higher mortality than C, suggesting fitness costs of dietary adaptation. Sex-specific effects emerged, with FA favoring early-life female survival and DA supporting late-life female longevity. Microbial richness and composition shifted with selection and time. While Firmicutes and Proteobacteria dominated generally, selection regimes showed higher Firmicute and lower Proteobacteria abundances compared to C, correlating with dysbiotic microbiomes starting early in adulthood. DA flies maintained a relatively stable microbial diversity over time, potentially supporting longevity. In contrast, CH and FA both exhibited low microbial diversity that destabilized with age. Indicator species analysis revealed treatment- and age-specific genera, with CH and FA showing greater dysbiosis, marked by potentially pathogenic taxa such as Leptotrichia and Mobiluncus. Our findings highlight the importance of early life stages in maintaining microbiome stability and host fitness, suggesting dietary stress drives distinct microbiota patterns and survival strategies."
"BackgroundAlzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by gray matter (GM) changes, such as amyloid-beta (A{beta}) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. While GM alterations are well-established, the fine-grained, spatially distinct patterns of homogeneous A{beta} uptake and their changes remain poorly understood. Additionally, white matter (WM) pathology is less explored. This study addresses these gaps by leveraging high-model-order independent component analysis (ICA) to identify spatially granular amyloid networks in both GM and WM.

MethodsWe analyzed [18F]Florbetapir (FBP) PET images from 716 participants in the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), classified as cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD dementia. High-model-order ICA was applied to identify 80 GM and 13 WM FBP-related networks, which were labeled using terms from the Neuromark 2.2 Atlas. Statistical analyses assessed diagnostic effects and relationships between these networks and cognitive and neuropsychiatric variables.

ResultsSignificant diagnostic differences were observed across GM and WM networks, revealing a continuous pattern of change from CN to MCI to AD. The analysis showed that the extended hippocampal, extended thalamic, basal ganglia, and frontal subdomains displayed an MCI profile closer to AD than to CN. In contrast, other subdomains exhibited a more mixed pattern, with MCI sometimes aligning more closely with CN and other times with AD. Notably, the hippocampal-entorhinal complex (HEC) within the extended hippocampal subdomain and the precuneus within the default mode subdomain were consistently associated with cognitive decline, highlighting their roles in disease progression. Additionally, WM networks, particularly the retrolenticular internal capsule (RICap), also demonstrated significant relationships with cognitive measures, suggesting that AD pathology extends beyond GM and disrupts broader network connectivity. These findings were validated in an independent replication dataset.

ConclusionHigh-model-order ICA effectively captures distinct fine-grained amyloid distributions, offering a network-level perspective that enhances our understanding of AD neurobiology. By decomposing complex PET signal patterns into distinct networks, this approach underscores the critical role of both GM and WM integrity in AD pathology. The consistent associations of the HEC, precuneus, and WM networks with cognitive decline highlight the widespread impact of AD-related pathology, emphasizing the value of this methodology in advancing AD research."
"Klebsiella pneumoniae make up 85% of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), bacteria that have become an urgent threat to public health. K. pneumoniae is largely transmitted in healthcare settings, where inpatients and outpatients are often anesthetized with the ubiquitously-used anesthetic induction agent propofol. Recent evidence indicates that propofol exposure can dramatically increase host susceptibility to microbial infections. Given that intubated patients are often given propofol and are at risk for K. pneumoniae lung infections, we investigated the outcome of K. pneumoniae infections in mice briefly sedated with either propofol or ketamine/xylazine as control. Propofol-sedated mice experienced more rapid dissemination from the lungs to secondary sites of infection and developed more severe lung pathology. Based on these observations, we investigated bacterial factors involved in infection and dissemination in mice with and without propofol sedation using a high throughput insertion sequencing (INSeq) approach. We identified numerous novel potential virulence factors together with previously identified gene products, confirming the validity of our screen. We further identified insertion mutants with differing degrees of attenuation dependent upon sedation method. These results highlight the importance of sedative choice when studying hospital-acquired microbial infections and suggest that sedation can influence the arsenal of bacterial virulence factors required to promote K. pneumoniae infection and dissemination in animal models.

IMPORTANCEHost sedation by either propofol or ketamine exposure varied the genetic requirements for K. pneumoniae during an intranasal mouse model of lung infection. This unprecedented result offers a deeper understanding of virulence factor function dependence on host immunity following sedation. Given the dominating use of propofol in health care settings and during intubation in the ICU, this work also provides important perspective as to how the choice of an anesthetic agent can impact the outcome of healthcare-associated infections."
"Temporal expectation-the ability to predict when events occur-relies on probabilistic information within the environment. Two types of temporal expectation, temporal precision, based on the variability of an events onset, and hazard rate, based on the increasing probability of an event with onset delay, interact with temporal attention-ability to prioritize specific moments- at the performance level: Attentional benefits increase with precision but diminish with hazard rate. Both temporal expectation and temporal attention improve fixational stability; however, the distinct oculomotor effects of temporal precision and hazard rate, as well as their interactions with temporal attention, remain unknown. Investigating microsaccade dynamics, we found that hazard-based expectations were reflected in the oculomotor responses, whereas precision-based expectations emerged only when temporal attention was deployed. We also found perception-eye movement dissociations for both types of temporal expectation, yet attentional benefits in performance coincided with microsaccade rate modulations. These findings reveal an interplay among distinct types of temporal expectation and temporal attention in enhancing and recalibrating fixational stability."
"Human eye movements are essential for understanding cognition, yet achieving high-precision eye tracking in fMRI remains challenging. Even slight head shifts from the initial calibration position can introduce drift in eye tracking data, leading to substantial gaze inaccuracies. To address this, we introduce Motion-Corrected Eye Tracking (MoCET), a novel approach that corrects drift using head motion parameters derived from the preprocessing of fMRI data. MoCET requires no additional hardware and can be applied retrospectively to existing datasets. We show that it outperforms traditional detrending methods with respect to accuracy of gaze estimation and offers higher spatial and temporal precision compared to MR-based eye tracking approaches. By overcoming a key limitation in integrating eye tracking with fMRI, MoCET facilitates investigations of naturalistic vision and cognition in fMRI research."
"Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) transplantation surgery has shown potential benefits in animal models and early clinical trials. However, current implantation techniques are limited by the need for large retinotomies when cell bearing scaffolds are used or cellular reflux in the case of cell suspension transplantation with micro-cannulae. Here we demonstrate that it is feasible to pass primary and stem cell derived RPE cells through microneedles with a bore as small as 30m. In vitro, there is no immediate loss of cell viability and this remains true throughout 14 days of live cell viability monitoring. Further, when the RPE cells are cultured over 14 days, they attach within 24 hours and become confluent, with normal morphological appearances. The formation of tight junctions is unimpeded with the typical polygonal pattern observed. The effects of shear stress due to passage of the cells through a small lumen were not evident in cultured cells labelled for the cytoskeletal protein F-actin. RPE cell VEGF secretion is unaffected by microneedle size in primary RPE and iPSC RPE cells. Ex vivo surgical implantation demonstrates that the technique is feasible, RPE cells engraft in the outer retina and we show that vitrectomy is not required to successfully transplant cells. Herein, we provide the first evidence of surgical microneedle cell delivery, which may have future applications more broadly within ophthalmic microsurgery and minimally invasive delivery strategies.

"Kainate receptors (KARs), along with AMPA and NMDA receptors, belong to the ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) family and play critical roles in mediating excitatory neurotransmission throughout the central nervous system. KARs also regulate neurotransmitter release and modulate neuronal excitability and plasticity. Receptor desensitization plays a critical role in modulating the strength of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. While KARs share overall structural similarity with AMPA receptors, the desensitized state of KARs differs strikingly from that of other iGluRs. Despite extensive studies on KARs, a fundamental question remains unsolved: why do KARs require large conformational changes upon desensitization, unlike other iGluRs? To address this, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of GluK2 with double cysteine mutations in non-desensitized, shallow-desensitized and deep-desensitized conformations. In the shallow-desensitized conformation, two cysteine crosslinks stabilize the receptors in a conformation that resembles the desensitized state of AMPA receptors. However, unlike the tightly closed pore observed in the deep-desensitized KAR and desensitized AMPAR conformations, the channel pore in the shallow-desensitized state remains incompletely closed. Patch-clamp recordings and fluctuation analysis suggest that this state remains ion-permeable, indicating that the lateral rotational movement of KAR ligand-binding domains (LBDs) is critical for complete channel closure and stabilization of the receptor in desensitization states. Together with the multiple conformations representing different degree of desensitization, our results define the unique mechanism and conformational dynamics of KAR desensitization.

HighlightsO_LIWe present cryo-EM structures of GluK2 kainate receptors with engineered cysteine crosslinks at the inter-dimer interface, which restrict subunit lateral rotation and attenuate receptor desensitization.
C_LIO_LIThe structure of GluK2 double cysteine mutant in complex with the allosteric potentiator BPAM344 and glutamate represents a non-desensitized state, highlighting the critical conformational changes required for ion channel gating.
C_LIO_LIThe glutamate-bound GluK2 mutant adopts multiple conformations, representing both shallow- and deep-desensitized states. Electrophysiological recordings indicate that the GluK2 kainate receptor mutant recovers from desensitization more rapidly, resembling AMPA receptors. Our structural and functional data suggest that shallow-desensitized KARs remain conductive, implying that the large lateral LBD rotation during KAR desensitization is essential for complete channel closure, distinguishing KARs from other iGluRs.

"Caenorhabditis elegans is a widely used model organism in biomedical research due to its genetic tractability, short life cycle, and conservation of many developmental processes with humans. In this study, undergraduate students conducted nine independent experiments during a Developmental Biology course to model human phenotypes using C. elegans. Each group selected a human phenotype of interest, identified a gene associated with the phenotype, and then determined the orthologous or homologous gene in C. elegans. By obtaining mutants and designing phenotypic assays, students investigated the extent to which the worm models could recapitulate aspects of the human condition. This collective work highlights both the potential and limitations of C. elegans as a model for human phenotypic variation and disease and demonstrates the value of undergraduate inquiry as a catalyst for scientific engagement and research-based learning."
"Avoiding lysosomal degradation is vital to the success of intracellular pathogens. The Gram-negative bacterium Coxiella burnetii and protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus are unique in being able to replicate within the mature phagolysosomal compartment of host cells, though the exact mechanisms utilised to withstand this hostile environment are not clearly defined. We recently reported that C. burnetii removes the lysosomal protease cathepsin B during infection of mammalian cells. Here, we aimed to determine if this virulence strategy was also employed by the intralysosomal pathogen, Leishmania mexicana. In contrast to C. burnetii, decreases in the activity of specific cathepsins were not detected in L. mexicana-infected host cells as determined using immunoblotting and protease activity-based probes. Co-infection of THP-1 macrophage-like cells with both pathogens resulted in a proteolytic and secretory phenotype consistent with C. burnetii infection, suggesting that C. burnetii-induced remodelling of the lysosome is not influenced by L. mexicana. The host cell proteome and secretome of L. mexicana infected cells was defined using mass spectrometry. This confirmed that, unlike C. burnetii, L. mexicana does not induce increased abundance of lysosomal proteins either intracellularly or in the extracellular milieu. Collectively, this study reveals that although C. burnetii and L. mexicana reside in a phagolysosomal intracellular niche, they employ divergent mechanisms to survive within this hostile compartment."
"Komagataella phaffii, also known as Pichia pastoris, is a powerful host for recombinant protein production, in part due to its exceptionally strong and tightly controlled PAOX1 promoter. Most K. phaffii bioprocesses for recombinant protein production rely on PAOX1 to achieve dynamic control in two-phase processes. Cells are first grown under conditions that repress PAOX1 (growth phase), followed by methanol-induced recombinant protein expression (production phase). In this study, we propose a methanol-free approach for dynamic metabolic control in K. phaffii using optogenetics, which can help enhance input tunability and flexibility in process optimization and control. The light-responsive transcription factor EL222 from Erythrobacter litoralis is used to regulate protein production from the PC120 promoter in K. phaffii with blue light. We used two system designs to explore the advantages and disadvantages of coupling or decoupling EL222 integration with that of the gene of interest. We investigate the relationship between EL222 gene copy number and light dosage to improve production efficiency for intracellular and secreted proteins. Experiments in lab-scale bioreactors demonstrate the feasibility of the outlined optogenetic systems as potential alternatives to conventional methanol-inducible bioprocesses using K. phaffii."
"Like animal vocalization and display, human singing and dancing allows non-verbal establishment of behavioral co-relation (i.e. correlation) between individuals. The predictable mathematical structure of music is its most defining acoustic property, allowing human synchronization of both physical behavior and emotion. In the biomolecular world, some proteins also interact in groups to achieve strong spatiotemporal co-relationships. This is prominent in amyloids, where many disordered fibrils individually conform to overall solenoid structures. We hypothesize that the vibrational frequencies captured during amyloid protein interactions may also exhibit elements of musicality related to this form of prosociality. Here, we develop a non-abstract data sonification method for computer-simulated molecular dynamic interactions. We apply auto-correlational and spectral cross-correlational analyses to a collection of sounds, defining 11 acoustic features that allow accurate machine learning classification of music from other types of natural sounds. By analyzing statistical shifts in these correlative features defining musicality, we demonstrate that amyloid interactions are more speech-like and musical than less structurally conforming protein interactions, primarily due to significant shifts in memory (persistence) and first order autocorrelation. We also find that music has less feature shift away from animal vocalization than human speech, suggesting it may have predated the evolution of language."
"Allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (AHST) can cure patients with many diseases, but harmful acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) remains a challenge. Many immune cells are implicated in the pathogenesis and control of alloreactive T-cell responses causing aGvHD, but the functionally dominant cells at different times remain unknown. Using mass cytometry to simultaneously assess alloreactive and immunoregulatory cell populations after AHST, we identified a robust early immune signature predictive of aGvHD rich in CD4 effector memory T-cells and deficient in functionally allosuppressive NK cells. Additionally, network analysis identified a heterogeneous immunoregulatory cell group (IRCG) that more accurately predicted aGVHD than any individual cell populations or established serum biomarkers. Immune signatures preceding aGvHD evolved over time, with qualitative and quantitative changes in both the alloreactive T-cell compartment and the constituent components of the IRCG. In mapping how alloreactive and immunoregulatory cell populations evolve temporally, we provide mechanistic insight into dynamic control of alloreactivity supporting development of time-sensitive targeted strategies to reduce aGvHD.

"Photoperiodic changes in diel cycles of gene expression are pervasive in plants. Timing of circadian regulators together with light signals regulate multiple photoperiod dependent responses such as growth, flowering or tuber formation. However, for most genes the importance of cyclic mRNA levels is less clear. We analyzed the diel transcriptome of modern cultivated potato, a highly heterozygous autotetraploid. Clonal propagation and limited meiosis have led to the accumulation of deleterious alleles and therefore tetraploid potato is an ideal model system to investigate the conservation of cyclic expression and cyclic genes during the artificial selection process. We observed that cyclic alleles were more highly expressed than non-cyclic ones and were highly co-expressed not only under diel cycles but also across tissues, developmental stages and stress conditions. Moreover, the smaller ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous differences within cyclic as compared to non-cyclic allelic groups indicates that cyclic genes, in general, have more conserved core functions than those of non-cyclic ones. In accordance with this observation, fully rhythmic allelic groups were highly enriched in photosynthesis and ribosome biogenesis genes, which play core functions in plants. Furthermore, we investigated differences in cyclic expression patterns between photoperiods. We identified transcription factors potentially regulating the strong differences in phase between photoperiods observed in ribosome biogenesis and pathogen response genes. Finally, analyses of genes involved in tuber formation suggests that the regulation of CO gene transcription is not the only factor enabling tuberization under long days in modern cultivated potato. This study not only provides high quality diel transcriptomic datasets of cultivated potato but also important insight on the role of allelic diversity in rhythmic expression in plants."
"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most prevalent vaginal disorder in women of childbearing age and causes pregnancy complications including preterm birth. Species of Gardnerella increase just prior to the onset of symptoms and are considered to play major roles in the development and transmission of BV. However, Gardnerella species have remained genetically intractable, limiting investigations of their virulence mechanisms. Here we describe methods for genetic manipulation of Gardnerella. Through trial and error we optimized methods for electrotransformation of Gardnerella and created methods for making mutations and complements. We mutated the gene for the toxin vaginolysin (vly) in G. vaginalis and the gene for sialidase nanH3 in G. pickettii. A vly point mutant was tested in human cervix tissue and found to lack lytic activity. The nanH3 mutant lost sialidase and mucus degradation activity. Overall, this genetic toolkit opens a door for molecular characterization of Gardnerella and its mechanisms in BV.

TeaserGenetic studies are now possible in a causative agent of bacterial vaginosis, and mutants were made lacking the toxin or mucus-degrading enzyme."
"Complex biological systems should often reconcile conflicting selection pressures. In systems based on molecular recognition, molecules must specifically identify certain partners while excluding others. Here we study how such selection pressures shape the evolution of the self-incompatibility system in plants. This system inhibits self-fertilization using specific molecular recognition between proteins, expressed in the plant female and male reproductive organs. We study the impact of these opposing selection pressures on the amino acid frequencies in these proteins recognition domain. We construct a theoretical framework enabling promiscuous recognition between proteins, as found empirically, and employ stochastic simulations to study its evolution. We find that selection exerts asymmetric responses of amino acid frequencies, affecting female proteins considerably, but hardly the male. Using large deviations theory, we well-approximate the simulated frequencies and find agreement with genomic data. Our work offers a general theoretical framework to study the impact of multiple selection pressures, applicable to additional biological systems."
"Neuroblastoma is a malignant childhood cancer with significant inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity, arising from abnormal differentiation of neural crest cells into sympathetic neurons. The lack of actionable mutations limits therapeutic options, highlighting the need to better understand the molecular mechanisms driving this differentiation. While RNA velocity has provided some insights, it is limited in modeling regulatory relationships.

To address this, we applied our integrated Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) inference and simulation tools using a published single-cell RNAseq dataset from human sympathoadrenal differentiation. Our analysis identified a 97-gene GRN driving the transition from Schwann cell precursors to chromaffin cells and sympathoblasts, highlighting dynamic interactions like self-reinforcing loops and toggle switches.

To showcase the models ability to predict the impact of perturbations, we conducted in silico knockouts (KOs) and overexpressions (OVs) of few selected genes. This analysis revealed that certain perturbations had a notably significant effect on the differentiation process, either acing specifically on one ligneage choice, or preventing cells to exit from a stem compartment. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the utility of our GRN model framework in predicting gene perturbations after inferring the GRN structure."
"The efficacy and duration of passive immunity protection depends on maternal antibody levels and transfer efficiency. We investigated whether oral vaccination of Peromyscus leucopus dams with recombinant OspA-expressing E. coli could induce maternal transfer of anti-OspA antibodies and protect pups from Borrelia burgdorferi challenge. Dams were vaccinated until breeding pairs were created (i), until parturition (ii), and until pups were 2 weeks old (iii). Pups were challenged with nymphal I. scapularis-transmitted B. burgdorferi at [~] 4 weeks of age. Anti-OspA IgG were quantified in dams and pups, and anti-B. burgdorferi IgG were quantified in pups. B. burgdorferi burden was assessed by flaB qPCR in pups tissues [~] 4 weeks after tick challenge and viability of B. burgdorferi was assessed by culture of heart tissue. P. leucopus pups born to dams vaccinated until breeding had low serologic anti-OspA antibody and were not protected from tick transmitted B. burgdorferi infection. However, when dams vaccination extended until parturition and until pups were two weeks old, significant anti-OspA antibody transfer and protection from B. burgdorferi infection occurred. This was evidenced by absence of antibody to B. burgdorferi PepVF, absence of B. burgdorferi flaB DNA in heart and bladder tissues, and absence of flaB in culture from heart tissues from pups euthanized >9 weeks after birth. We show that transfer of anti-OspA antibodies from vaccinated P. leucopus dams to offspring prevents tick transmission and infection dynamics of B. burgdorferi in the major reservoir host of this spirochete in the United States.

ImportanceThis study contributes to our understanding of how interventions based in reservoir targeted OspA vaccines designed to block transmission of B. burgdorferi from infected I. scapularis ticks may disrupt the enzootic cycle of this spirochete and reduce incidence of Lyme disease."
"This study analyzes the archaeological record of the Arenal Central site, a Guarani residential base located on Martin Garcia Island, within the Rio de la Plata estuary--marking the southernmost extent of this population originating from the tropical forests of South America. The results significantly advance our understanding of these Amazonian forager-horticulturalists in the region, allowing us to explore a range of strategies and material culture expressions developed in an environment suboptimal for canoe-based populations. The study also presents a new set of chronological data, substantially increasing the number of radiocarbon dates available for these groups in the area. Findings indicate that Arenal Central was occupied around 1400 CE, during the final phase of the Guarani expansion across the La Plata Basin. From this location, a vast catchment area was incorporated, including the lower Uruguay River, the Parana Delta islands, and the adjacent Uruguayan steppe. The extensive use of territory appears to have been a strategic response to the islands limited carrying capacity and the scarcity of key resources required to sustain the Guarani ecological niche. While the recovered assemblage preserves the core features of Guarani material culture, a marked decline is observed in the complexity of pictorial expressions--particularly in painted ceramics. This simplification may reflect reduced intra-ethnic interaction, likely due to the low density of Guarani populations in the surrounding area, as well as the challenges imposed by a constrained insular setting. We also compare subsistence strategies and ceramic assemblages from other sites that have been excavated and analyzed following comparable standards. Finally, the results are contextualized within the broader process of Guarani occupation of the Parana Delta and the Rio de la Plata estuary."
"Stroke remains a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide, with variable recovery trajectories posing substantial challenges in anticipating post-event care and rehabilitation planning. To address these challenges, we established the NeuralCup consortium to benchmark predictive models of stroke outcome through a collaborative, data-driven approach. This study presents findings from 15 international teams who used a comprehensive dataset including clinical and imaging data, to identify and compare predictors of motor, cognitive, and emotional outcomes one year post-stroke. Our analyses integrated traditional statistical approaches and novel machine learning algorithms to uncover optimal recipes for predicting each domain. The differences in these  optimal recipes reflect distinct brain mechanisms in response to different tasks. Key predictors across all domains included infarct characteristics, T1-weighted MRI sequences, and demographic factors. Additionally, integrating FLAIR imaging and white matter tract analysis significantly improved the prediction of cognitive and motor outcomes, respectively. These findings support a multifaceted approach to stroke outcome prediction, underscoring the potential of collaborative data science to develop personalized care strategies that enhance recovery and quality of life for stroke survivors.

"Breeding for stalk lodging resistance is of paramount importance to maintain and improve maize yield and quality and meet increasing food demand. The integration of environmental, phenotypic, and genotypic information offers the opportunity to develop genomic prediction strategies that can improve the genetic gain for complex traits such as stalk lodging. However, implementation of genomic predictions for stalk lodging resistance has been sparse primarily due to the lack of reliable and reproducible phenotyping strategies. In this study, we measured 10 traits related to stalk lodging resistance obtained from a novel phenotyping platform on approximately 31,000 individual stalks. These traits were combined with environmental information and whole-genome resequence data to investigate the predictive ability of different single and multi-environment genomic prediction models. In total, 555 maize inbred lines from the Wisconsin diversity panel were evaluated in four environments. The multi-environment models more than doubled the prediction accuracy compared to the single-environment model for most traits, particularly when predicting lines in a sparse testing design. Predictive correlations for stalk bending strength and stalk flexural stiffness, a non-destructive method for assessment of stalk lodging resistance, were moderately high and ranged between 0.32 to 0.89 and 0.26 to 0.88, respectively. In contrast, rind thickness was the most difficult trait to predict. Our results show that the use of multi-environmental data could improve genomic prediction accuracy for stalk lodging resistance and its intermediate phenotypes. This study will serve as a first step toward genetic improvement and the development of maize varieties resistant to stalk lodging.

Plain language summaryStalk lodging - when maize stalks break or fall over before harvest - can seriously reduce crop yields. Breeding maize that resists lodging is important to ensure reliable food production. We tested about 31,000 individual stalks for 10 traits related to lodging resistance using a new phenotyping system. These traits were combined with environmental information and whole-genome resequence data to investigate the predictive ability of single and multi-environment genomic prediction models. By analyzing 555 maize lines, we found that using data from multiple environments improved genomic prediction accuracy by more than twice as much as using data from a single environment. Traits such as bending strength and flexural stiffness were easier to predict, while rind thickness was more difficult. These results show that combining genetic, environmental, and phenotypic data can help breeders more accurately select maize plants with stronger stalks, leading to better, more resilient crops."
"Fluent reading requires the brain to precisely encode the positions of letters within words, distinguishing for instance FORM and FROM across variations in size, position, and font. While early visual areas are known to encode retinotopic positions, how these representations transform into invariant neural codes remains unclear. Building on a computational model of reading, we used 7T fMRI and MEG to reveal a cortical hierarchy in which early visual areas (V1-V4) predominantly encode retinotopic information, whereas higher-level regions, including the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), transition to an ordinal letter-position code. MEG analyses confirm that retinotopic encoding emerges early (60-200 ms), followed by a shift toward ordinal representations in later time windows (220-450 ms). Despite this transition, word position remained a dominant factor across all time points, suggesting a concurrent coding of both retinotopic and abstract positional information. These findings uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics by which the human brain transforms visual input into structured linguistic representations, shedding light on the cortical stages of reading and their developmental and clinical implications."
"BackgroundGene-Set Analysis (GSA) is commonly used to analyze high-throughput experiments. However, GSA cannot readily disentangle clusters or pathways due to redundancies in upstream knowledge bases, which hinders comprehensive exploration and interpretation of biological findings. To address this challenge, we developed GeneSetCluster, an R package designed to summarize and integrate GSA results. Over time, we and users as well identified limitations in the original version, such as difficulties in managing redundancies across multiple gene-sets, large computational times, and its lack of accessibility for users without programming expertise.

ResultsWe present GeneSetCluster 2.0, a comprehensive upgrade that delivers methodological, computational, interpretative, and user-experience enhancements. Methodologically, GeneSetCluster 2.0 introduces a novel approach to address duplicated gene-sets and implements a seriation-based clustering algorithm that reorders results, aiding pattern identification. Computationally, the package is optimized for parallel processing, significantly reducing execution time. GeneSetCluster 2.0 enhances cluster annotations by associating clusters with relevant tissues and biological processes to improve biological interpretation, particularly for human and mouse data. To broaden accessibility, we have developed a user-friendly web application enabling non-programmers to use it. This version also ensures seamless integration between the R package, catering to users with programming expertise, and the web application for broader audiences. We evaluated the updates in a single-cell RNA public dataset.

ConclusionGeneSetCluster 2.0 offers substantial improvements over its predecessor. Furthermore, by bridging the gap between bioinformaticians and clinicians in multidisciplinary teams, GeneSetCluster 2.0 facilitates collaborative research. The R package and web application, along with detailed installation and usage guides, are available on GitHub (https://github.com/TranslationalBioinformaticsUnit/GeneSetCluster2.0), and the web application can be accessed at https://translationalbio.shinyapps.io/genesetcluster/."
"Large-scale copy number aberrations are a hallmark of many cancers, showing widespread associations with tumour cell phenotypes, therapy resistance, and patient outcomes. Several existing methods can infer copy number profiles from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. However, there is currently no methodology to separate the effects of the copy number state on single tumour cell phenotypes from the copy number-independent variation. We present ISOMERIC, an unsupervised deep learning framework to learn disentangled representations of single-cell expression data that are dependent on or independent of copy number profiles. We apply ISOMERIC to multiple cancer types and examine how copy number shapes transcriptional states. We find distinct associations between copy number-dependent and independent variation and clinical subtypes in multiple cancer types and link such variation to tumour microenvironment phenotypes. Together, this establishes a principled framework for untangling the effects of genetic and intrinsic variation on tumour transcriptomes and the consequences on clinically meaningful phenotypes."
"Cells grow their boundaries by incorporating newly synthesized lipids into their membranes as well as through fusion of intracellular vesicles. As these processes yield trans-bilayer imbalances in lipid numbers, cells must actively flip lipid molecules across the bilayer to enable growth. Using giant and small unilamellar vesicles (GUVs and SUVs, respectively), we here recapitulate cellular growth and division under various conditions of transmembrane  flip flop of lipids. By dynamically monitoring the changes in reduced volume and spontaneous curvature of GUVs that grow by fusion of many small SUVs, the morphology of these growing  synthetic cells is quantified. We demonstrate that lipid flip flop relaxes curvature stresses and yields more symmetrically sized buds. Further increasing the neck curvature is shown to lead to bud scission. The mechanisms presented here offer fundamental insights into cell growth and division, which are important for understanding early protocells and designing synthetic cells that are able to grow and divide."
"Hydrogels with tunable swelling and shrinking properties are of great interest in biomedical applications, particularly in wound healing, tissue regeneration, and drug delivery. Traditional hydrogels often fail to achieve high swelling without mechanical failure. In contrast, high-swelling hydrogels can absorb large amounts of liquid, expanding their volume by 10-1000 times, due to low crosslink density and the presence of hydrophilic groups. Additionally, some high-swelling hydrogels can also shrink in response to external stimuli, making them promising for applications like on-demand drug delivery and biosensors. An emerging application of high-swelling hydrogels is four-dimensional (4D) printing, where controlled swelling induces structural transformations in a 3D printed construct. However, current hydrogel systems show limited swelling capacity, restricting their ability to undergo significant shape changes. To address these limitations, we developed a high-swelling composite hydrogel, termed SwellMA, by combining gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) and sodium polyacrylate (SPA). SwellMA exhibits a swelling capacity over 500% of its original area and can increase its original water weight by 100-fold, outperforming existing materials in 4D bioprinting. Furthermore, SwellMA constructs can cyclically swell and shrink on-demand upon changing the ionic strength of the aqueous solution. Additionally, SwellMA demonstrates superior cytocompatibility and cell culture properties than SPA, along with excellent 3D printing fidelity. These findings demonstrate SwellMAs potential for advanced 4D printing and a broad range of biomedical applications requiring precise and dynamic control over hydrogel swelling and shrinking."
"Haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a fatal disease caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection. Humoral immunity is essential for effective viral clearance, but the glycosylation characteristics of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in HFRS patients is not well known. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HFRS patients were obtained for B subset analysis using scRNA-seq and flow cytometry. HTNV specific IgG antibody titers were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and IgG glycosylation was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography. The proportions of the antibody-secreting memory (ASM) B cells and plasmablasts (PB) were significantly expanded among acute HFRS patients. We discovered significantly increased fucosylated IgG and decreased bisecting N-acetylglucosamine during the convalescent phase of HTNV infection. However, positive correlations were observed between ASM subsets and galactosylation/sialylation in the IgG Fc region, and between PB subsets and sialylation. Notably, the glycosylation-related genes were primarily differentially expressed in the ASM and PB subclusters, such as PRN1 and PRN2, which were enriched in the N-glycosylation modifications of proteins through asparagine. Our findings indicated that IgG N-glycosylation may play a crucial role in combating HTNV infection and contributing to clinical recovery, which provided new insights for optimizing glycoengineered therapeutic antibodies."
"Aberrant aggregation of proteins into amyloid fibrils is associated with numerous neurodegenerative, systemic and metabolic diseases. Amyloidogenic proteins undergo spontaneous liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), rapidly forming protein-rich condensates prior to fibrillization. However, the exact effects of LLPS on amyloid aggregation remain unclear as contrasting fibrillization-promotion, inhibition and even biphasic effects have been reported in the literature. In this study, we integrate LLPS-induced heterogeneity of protein concentrations into a thermodynamic-kinetic model of amyloid aggregation. We adopt the phase transition theory and introduce protein condensates as an additional protein state alongside non-interacting monomers, oligomers and fibrils. Oligomerization and fibrillization can occur both in the protein-rich condensates and the protein-poor solution. This model allows us to derive the time evolution of different states - monomers, condensates, oligomers, and fibrils - spanning a wide range of concentrations, and determine how model parameters related to LLPS, fibrillization, and oligomerization influence fibrillization kinetics. Using this global model, we resolve the seemingly contradictory effects of LLPS on fibrillization. We expect the developed thermodynamic-kinetic model of LLPS, and amyloid aggregation will help advance our understanding, modulation, and mitigation of pathological aggregation processes in amyloid diseases.

"Individual-based long-term datasets are needed to investigate the relationships between drivers of labile individual traits. A case in point is dominance structures, which has been shown to vary greatly across years and populations. Using an eight-year dataset, encompassing more than 700 individuals, we studied the association between the size of a melanin-based plumage trait (a black patch under the beak or  bib), individual attributes (age and sex) and dominance. Our study model, the sociable weaver (Philetairus socius), is a small passerine, which lives year-round in colonies of varying size. Bib sizes were obtained from pictures and automatically pre-processed with an object segmentation deep learning network based on YOLO. We recorded 36,346 dominance-related interactions to estimate dominance hierarchies. We then investigated the effect of sex and age on bib size, and the overall and between-year association of bib size and age with dominance for each sex. We found that bib size increased with age within individuals of both sexes. Age was a strong and consistent predictor of dominance in males, but not in females. Nevertheless, dominance was not correlated with bib size in males and not in females. Finally, these relationships did not strongly vary between years. Our results suggest that males and females may use different factors to regulate dominance interactions. Furthermore, our longitudinal dataset allowed us to show that bib size is not a badge of status under our population conditions even though its growth encodes age information, highlighting the importance of considering multiple traits over time when studying morphological signalling of hierarchy positions."
"Lysosome-related organelles (LROs) are a heterogeneous family of organelles found in many cell types, whose significant similarities to lysosomes include their acidification by vacuolar-type ATPases (V-ATPases). However, some organelles with hallmarks of LROs are nonetheless non-acidic. Here we investigate this poorly understood phenomenon using the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, which have prominent secretory LROs called mucocysts. Using three different approaches, we show that mature mucocysts, poised for exocytosis, are non-acidic. Nonetheless, a specific V-ATPase a-subunit is targeted to mucocysts and is indispensable for mucocyst biogenesis and secretion. Consistent with this, immature mucocysts in the cytoplasm appear to be transiently acidified. The stage specificity of acidification can be explained by our finding that several canonical V-ATPase subunits are present in the immature, but not mature, mucocysts. Our data argue that a mucocyst-specific V-ATPase complex is targeted to newly-forming mucocysts and subsequently disassembles at a late stage in Tetrahymena LRO maturation, and that this depends on the AP-3 trafficking adaptor."
"In computational chemistry, molecular docking--predicting the binding structure of a small molecule ligand to a protein--is vital for understanding interactions between small molecules and their protein targets, with broad applications in drug discovery (Morris and Lim-Wilby, 2008). Traditional docking methods rely on energy-based scoring functions and optimization algorithms to identify ligand-binding structures. However, these methods are often slow and inaccurate due to the extensive search space for binding structures and the complexity of scoring function landscapes (Corso et al., 2023).

Deep learning techniques have emerged as promising alternatives for molecular docking. These methods harness the power of neural networks to understand the complex interactions between protein pockets and ligands from large datasets. They can be classified into two categories: regression-based methods (Stark et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022), which offer greater computational efficiency compared to traditional docking methods but have yet to offer substantial improvements in accuracy (Corso et al., 2023); and generative models, particularly diffusion models (Corso et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024; Nakata et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2024; Schneuing et al., 2024), which lead to significant accuracy improvements compared to regression-based methods.

Most diffusion-based docking methods aim to address the blind docking problem, where the ligand is docked without prior knowledge of the specific protein pocket--a site of the protein with potential ligand-binding capabilities--and only the overall protein structure is provided (Yim et al., 2024). However, in many drug discovery cases, specific pockets have already been identified (Zheng et al., 2013), meaning that the docking process only needs to determine how the ligand binds to the pocket. This defines the pocket-based docking problem. Pocket-based docking leverages the physical and chemical information of protein side chains around the pocket, significantly reducing the search space for ligand binding structures and improving the understanding of atomic-level interactions. Additionally, focusing on the local protein substructure rather than the global structure enhances computational efficiency, which allows for the use of more complex neural architectures.

We introduce DTMol, a novel diffusion model designed to tackle the pocket-based docking problem. Our model integrates a pretrained molecular representation framework with a diffusion transformer architecture. The advantages of this design are twofold: first, the molecular representation models we employ are pretrained on separate datasets of small molecules and protein pockets, which are larger than the datasets of ligand-pocket interactions. Consequently, these pretrained models encode typical structural features of both elements, enhancing our models ability to represent them and predict binding structures. Second, the transformer architecture used in our diffusion model is more capable of effectively capturing all-atom interactions between the pocket and the ligand.

We test our method on the docking benchmark PDBBind v2020 and PoseBuster, and compare it with other methods. DTMol achieves 77.65% top-1 success rate (RMSD {inverted exclamation} 2[A]) on PoseBuster, outperforms the second-best docking software Gnina (65.65%) We also test the performance of our method on a real-world virtual screening task using Janus kinase 2 (PDB ID: 6BBV) as the target protein. A TR-FRET screening experiment is performed on the union of top ligands identified via physics-based docking and the diffusion model, in order to measure their inhibitory activity against the JAK2 protein. The results shows that our model achieved the only positive rank correlation score compared to other traditional docking methods and machine learning-based methods.

To summarize, the main contributions of this work are:

- We introduce DTMol, a novel diffusion model designed to address the pocket-based docking problem. This model represents the first application of the diffusion transformer architecture in solving pocket-based molecular docking.
- We propose a novel SE(3)-equivariant transformer architecture with an SE(3)-invariant and a parallel SE(3)-equivariant flow, which is straightforward to implement and train while achieving excellent performance.
- We achieve new state-of-the-art results on both the PDBBind and PoseBuster pocket-based docking benchmarks, obtaining top-1 prediction rates of 45.05% and 77.65%, respectively, at RMSD < 2[A].
- Doing virtual screening on Janus kinase 2, DTMol is able to achieve the only positive rank score; and identifies 2 new experimentally effective JAK2 inhibitors."
"Does the human visual system sample shapes at discrete points? During adaptation, when the neurons are fatigued, one observes the underlying principles that were once less prominent than the fatigued features. Operating under deficit, these less prominent features expose the original contributions from the fatigued neurons that are now absent. An underlying lower-order neural process is thus, now revealed. In this paper, we conduct experiments using a modified version of the circle-polygon illusion to reveal the brains sampling pattern. The circle-polygon illusion produces polygonal percepts during adaptation when a static dark outline circle is pulsed at 2 Hz alternating with a gradient luminance circle. We define sampling as the edge length of the emergent polygon. We develop a reconstruction function that defines the edge length based on psychophysical responses. We perform two experiments. In the first experiment, we present circles of size [2,4,8,16] deg presented at eccentricity [0,1,2,4,8] deg in a cross design. In the second experiment, we modify the method of Sakurai (2014) and display arc lengths that are 1/8, 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, 5/8, 3/4, 7/8 and 1 (whole) of a circle, of size 4 and 8 deg, presented centrally. The observers report the edge length. We find that the stimulus size and presentation eccentricity, taken together, best explain the edge length reported by the users. The users, as a random effect, do not influence the mean of the edge length reported when considering the best model reported (size and eccentricity together). However, the users do influence edge length reported only when using mean eccentricity or eccentricity as the parameter influencing edge length. Arc lengths of a circle produce the same or similar edge lengths. The length of the curve does not play a significant role signifying that biological neurophysiology at an eccentricity controls the edge length formation. Using the influences on edge length, we define sampling as a sum of qualitative influences and a sampling function derived from Taylors polynomial using sampling values along the eccentricity grid. As we use the sampled values directly to reconstruct the function, we remove the need for recording directly from neurons and instead rely on behavioural responses to build the reconstruction function."
"During sleep, our brain undergoes highly synchronized activity, orchestrated by distinct neural rhythms. Little is known about the associated brain activation during these sleep rhythms, and even less about their functional implications. In this study, we investigated the brain-wide activation underlying human sleep rhythms by employing simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 107 participants during nocturnal nap (first half of the night). We identified robust coupling between slow oscillations (SOs) and fast spindles during deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (N2/3 stages), with spindle peaks consistently occurring just before the SO UP-state. This SO-spindle coupling was linked to elevated activation in both the thalamus and hippocampus, alongside increased functional connectivity from the hippocampus to the thalamus and from the thalamus to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). An open-ended cognitive state decoding analysis suggested that these activations may relate to episodic memory processes, yet were distinct from task-related networks. Together, these findings highlight the thalamus as a key coordinator of hippocampal-cortical communication during sleep and provide new insights into the mechanisms by which synchronized sleep rhythms may support memory consolidation."
"BackgroundGlioblastoma (GBM) is a highly vascularized, heterogeneous tumor, yet anti-angiogenic therapies have yielded limited survival benefits. The lack of validated predictive biomarkers for treatment response stratification remains a major challenge. Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex-interacting multicomplex proteins (AIMPs) 1/2/3 have been implicated in CNS diseases, but their roles in gliomas remain unexplored. We investigated their association with angiogenesis and their significance as predictive biomarkers for anti-angiogenic treatment response.

MethodsIn this multi-cohort retrospective study we analyzed glioma samples from TCGA, CGGA, Rembrandt, Gravendeel, BELOB and REGOMA trials, and four single-cell transcriptomic datasets. Multi-omic analyses incorporated transcriptomic, epigenetic, and proteomic data. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the prognostic value of AIMPs in heterogeneous and homogeneous treatment-groups. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we explored spatial and cell-type-specific AIMP2 expression in GBM.

ResultsAIMP1/2/3 expressions correlated significantly with angiogenesis across TCGA cancers. In gliomas, AIMPs were upregulated in tumor vs. normal tissues, higher- vs. lower-grade gliomas, and recurrent vs. primary tumors (p<0.05). Upon retrospective analysis of two clinical trials assessing different anti-angiogenic drugs, we found that high-AIMP2 subgroups had improved response to therapies in GBM (REGOMA: HR 4.75 [1.96-11.5], p<0.001; BELOB: HR 2.3 [1.17-4.49], p=0.015). AIMP2-cg04317940 methylation emerged as a clinically applicable stratification marker. Single-cell analysis revealed homogeneous AIMP2 expression in tumor tissues, particularly in AC-like cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to tumor angiogenesis.

ConclusionsThese findings provide novel insights into the role of AIMPs in angiogenesis, offering improved patient stratification and therapeutic outcomes in recurrent GBM."
"Synthetic biology enables the precise control of bacterial population dynamics through engineered genetic circuits, paving the way for innovative therapeutic and biosensing applications. Here, we present genetic circuit design that leverages AHL (acyl-homoserine lactone)-based quorum sensing and a transcriptional cascade regulated by an external inducer to drive synchronized proliferation and lysis events. In this system, the absence of the inducer arabinose prevents CinR mediated repression, enabling activation of a transcriptional cascade that drives the expression of the lysis protein, fluorescent protein, and a drug resistance gene. The accumulation of AHL acts as a proxy for population density and modulates gene expression through a quorum-sensing mechanism. This inducible circuit provides tunable and pulsatile control over bacterial population dynamics, enabling cycles of population growth and collapse. Such behavior prevents premature population clearance while ensuring functional bacterial densities for extended durations. Our system represents a foundational step toward implementing more complex multi-stable architectures for self-regulation of bacterial population. This dynamic and modular framework offers significant advantages for therapeutic interventions, such as self-regulating drug delivery, inflammation-responsive probiotic therapies, and targeted bacterial therapy."
"MYST lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) is a class of epigenetic enzymes critical for cellular function that constitute an emerging therapeutic target in cancer. Recently, several drug-like MYST inhibitors have been reported that show promise in a variety of preclinical models as well as in clinical trials of breast cancer. However, the comparative properties of these small molecules remains to be directly assessed. Here we apply an integrated profiling strategy to systematically define the potency and selectivity of drug-like MYST KAT inhibitors. First, we use optimized chemoproteomic profiling and histone acetylation biormarkers to study the industry-developed KAT inhibitor PF-9363. This reveals dose-dependent engagement of native KAT complexes, with hierarchical inhibition following the order KAT6A/B > KAT7 >> KAT8 > KAT5. Next, we demonstrate how PF-9363s ability to disrupt capture of MYST complex members in chemoproteomic experiments can be leveraged to identify new candidate members of these complexes, including the transcription factor FOXK2. Applying insights from these studies to WM-8014, WM-1119 and WM-3835, which have been extensively applied in the literature as MYST probes, highlights unexpected cross-inhibition and suggests a new framework for how these small molecules and biomarkers may be applied to differentiate KAT6A/B and KAT7-dependent phenotypes. Finally, we benchmark the activity of PF-9363 in the NCI-60 cell line screen, providing evidence that it can inhibit the growth of cell lines that are resistant to other epigenetic inhibitors by engaging the essential MYST enzyme KAT8 at high concentrations. Collectively, our studies indicate the potential for MYST KAT inhibitors to exhibit dose-dependent target engagement reminiscent of kinase inhibitors and specify assays and biomarkers for facile monitoring of selective and hierarchical effects."
"BackgroundChanges to the epigenetic landscape play an important role in cardiovascular aging, where alterations in histone modifications influence gene expression by regulating DNA accessibility and chromatin structure. Our investigation into epigenetic changes during myocardial aging revealed that the repressive epigenetic mark H3K27me3 is significantly upregulated in aged mice and humans. This increase in H3K27me3 was shown to impair cardiomyocyte autophagy and drive metabolic reprogramming, key features of myocardial aging and causatively linked to dysfunction. Notably, by alleviating this repressive mark through a modified diet, we successfully mitigated the aged myocardial phenotype.

MethodsHeart tissue from young and aged mice and humans was analyzed for H3K27me3 levels using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining. Genes regulated by H3K27me3 were identified through CUT&RUN-Seq and RNA-Seq, while metabolites were profiled using metabolomics. In neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), H3K27me3 levels were elevated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of UTX. Cellular metabolism was investigated using a Seahorse analyzer in cardiomyocytes with basal or elevated H3K27me3 levels. In further human studies, we assessed how circulating glutamine levels associate with the incidence of heart failure and the association of genetic variants within the SLC1A5 region with heart disease. In aged mice, H3K27me3 levels were reduced through a modified diet, and heart function was evaluated using echocardiography. Subsequently, hearts were processed for biochemical analysis, and autophagy was assessed using electron microscopy.

ResultsH3K27me3 was significantly elevated in the aged mouse and human myocardium. This observed elevation in H3K27me3 was found to be attributed to impaired glutamine metabolism, resulting from reduced expression of the glutamine transporter SLC1A5 in the aged myocardium. Furthermore, elevation in H3K27me3 was found to contribute to impaired cardiomyocyte autophagy and metabolic dysfunction. In aged mice supplemented with a high glutamine diet this attenuated myocardial H3K27me3 and improved cardiac function. Furthermore, a high-glutamine diet reversed H3K27me3-mediated impairment in cardiac autophagy in aged mice.

ConclusionsReduction in SLC1A5 during aging is likely to lead to increased myocardial H3K27me3 that results in impaired autophagy and metabolic reprogramming that contribute to the aged cardiac phenotype. Our findings also suggest glutamine may improve cardiac health in the aged population by lowering H3K27me3.

"Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) drive essential cellular functions but resist conventional structural-function annotation due to their dynamic conformations. Current computational methods struggle with cross-dataset generalization and functional subtype discrimination. We present IDPFunNet, a hybrid deep learning model combining convolutional neural network, bidirectional LSTM, residual MLP, and the protein language model ProtT5 to predict six IDR functional classes: five binding subtypes and disorded flexible linkers (DFLs). Its dual-path architecture decouples binding IDR prediction and DFL identification using evolutionary embeddings from ProtT5, which outperformed ESM-family models and AlphaFold2 structural features by [&ge;] 1.3% average AUC and [&ge;] 12.7% average APS. Validated across six benchmarks including CAID2/3 blind tests, IDPFunNet achieves superior protein-binding prediction (AUC 0.832-0.866) with significant improvements ([&ge;]1.5%, p-value<0.05) over existing methods, while matching specialized DFL predictors. Multi-task learning enhances protein/lipid/small molecule-binding performance (3.1-35.1% AUC gains) with BiLSTMs proving optimal DFL identification, despite self-attentions potential for nucleic acid-binding (AUC 0.831). This framework overcomes methodological limitations through interpretable, generalizable IDR functional mapping."
"The explosive growth of numerical biomedical data poses a challenge in uncovering meaningful insights within from vast omics and clinical data. In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for processing and dissecting numerical biomedical data, making it a popular choice for addressing analytical challenges in biomedical research. Nevertheless, the intricate algorithms and complex optimization processes of machine learning model frameworks have deterred numerous non-machine learning experts. To address the need for comprehensive signatures exploration in biomedical field, we have developed Maler (http://www.inbirg.com/maler/home), a platform designed to facilitate the effortless and efficient application of machine learning models to high-dimensional biomedical data for bioscientists. Maler primarily offers four machine learning modes and a variety of machine learning algorithms to accommodate diverse analysis requirements. Simultaneously, it employs multiple feature selection methods to acquire relevant features and selects the optimal combinations of features based on machine learning models to achieve the best predictive outcomes. Maler is expected to provide a user-friendly and efficient platform for marker discovery, catering to the needs of biologists and clinical experts."
"Microglia are immune cells of the brain and act as major antigen presenting cells. Antigen presentation involves the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, which is implicated in genetic risk of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. How HLA affects the function of microglia in the context of neurodegenerative disease remains unclear. Here, we investigated the HLA epitopes and their protein interactome in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia-like cells (iMGLs) using systematic mass spectrometry (MS)-based immunopeptidomics, whole-cell proteomics, affinity purification, and prediction algorithms. Our results revealed the presence of almost 7,000 peptides presented by HLA class I and II within microglia. We further showed that the immunopeptidome landscapes of iPSCs, iMGLs and interferon-gamma (IFN{gamma}) stimulated iMGLs are all readily distinguishable. Furthermore, HLA interacts with different groups of proteins in iPSCs compared to iMGLs which involve proteins in immune response. Importantly, we detected 25 HLA epitopes derived from 15 genes associated with Alzheimers and related dementias such as Tau, PLD3 (Alzheimers disease), TDP-43, FUS (Frontotemporal dementia), and PARK7, VPS35 (Lewy Body dementia). We predicted 31 mutant epitopes derived from these ADRD genes that could be presented with strong interaction to HLA molecules. Along with these epitopes, we observed an enrichment of immune-related interaction proteins in microglia treated with IFN{gamma}. These results provide evidence that aggregated and mutated proteins can interact with HLA alleles and be presented on the cell surface by microglia cells. This study sheds light on the antigen presenting and adaptive immunity mechanism within the central nervous system and its possible effects on neurodegenerative diseases."
"Dynamic criticality - the balance between order and chaos - is fundamental to genome regulation and cellular transitions. In this study, we investigate the distinct behaviors of gene expression dynamics in MCF-7 breast cancer cells under two stimuli: Heregulin (HRG), which promotes cell-fate transitions, and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), which binds to the same receptor but fails to induce cell-fate changes. We model the system as an open, non-equilibrium thermodynamic system and introduce a convergence-based framework for robust estimation of information-thermodynamic metrics.

Our analysis reveals that the Shannon entropy of the critical point (CP) dynamically synchronizes with the entropy of the rest of the whole expression system (WES), reflecting coordinated transitions between ordered and disordered phases. This phase synchronization is driven by net mutual information scaling with CP entropy dynamics, demonstrating how the CP governs genome-wide coherence. Furthermore, higher-order mutual information emerges as a defining feature of the nonlinear gene expression network, capturing collective effects beyond simple pairwise interactions.

By achieving thermodynamic phase synchronization, the CP orchestrates the entire expression system. Under HRG stimulation, the CP becomes active, functioning as a Maxwells demon with dynamic, rewritable chromatin memory to guide a critical transition in cell fate. In contrast, under EGF stimulation, the CP remains passive during non-critical expression dynamics.

These findings establish a biophysical framework for cell-fate determination, paving the way for innovative approaches in cancer research and stem cell therapy."
"Impairments of locus coeruleus (LC) are implicated in anxiety/depression and Alzheimers disease (AD). Increases in cytosolic noradrenaline (NA) concentration and MAO-A activity initiate the LC impairment through production of NA metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-glycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL), by MAO-A. However, how NA accumulates in soma/dendritic cytosol of LC neurons has never been addressed despite the fact that NA is virtually absent in cytosol while NA is produced exclusively in cytoplasmic vesicles from dopamine by dopamine-{beta}-hydroxylase. Since re-uptake of autocrine-released NA following spike activity is the major source of NA accumulation, we investigated whether and how chronic stress can increase the spike activity accompanied by NA-autocrine. Overexcitation of LC neurons is normally prevented by the autoinhibition mediated by activation of 2A-adrenergic receptor (AR)-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium-current (GIRK-I) with autocrine-released NA. Patch-clamp study revealed that NA-induced GIRK-I in LC neurons was decreased in chronic restraint stress (RS) mice while a similar decrease was gradually caused by repeated excitation. Chronic RS caused internalization of 2A-ARs expressed in cell membrane in LC neurons and decreased protein/mRNA levels of 2A-ARs/GIRKs in membrane fraction. Subsequently, chronic RS increased the protein levels of MAO-A, DOPEGAL-induced asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) and tau N368. These results suggest that chronic RS-induced overexcitation due to the internalization of 2A-ARs/GIRK is accompanied by [Ca2+]i increases, subsequently increasing Ca2+-dependent MAO-A activity and NA-autocrine. Thus, it is likely that internalization of 2A-AR increased cytosolic NA, as reflected in AEP increases, by facilitating re-uptake of autocrine-released NA. The suppression of 2A-AR internalization may have a translational potential for AD treatment."
"Pathogenic microorganisms pose a significant threat to plant health and agricultural productivity worldwide. Herein, this study explores the potential of natural microbial communities as sources of biopesticides. We analyzed 20 soil and water samples from remote areas, isolating 121 colonies using nutrient agar. Antibacterial activity was assessed through agar diffusion, revealing that 12 colonies exhibited significant inhibitory effects against various pathogenic bacteria. Measurement of inhibition zones indicated that these colonies could produce antibiotics. Subsequently, molecular characterization with 16S rRNA and BLAST searches of 12 unidentified sequences highlighted substantial microbial diversity within the samples. This research underscores the promise of these natural microbial communities in developing biocontrol agents for managing plant diseases in greenhouse and field environments. Extraction and purification techniques could further refine these antibiotics, advancing sustainable agricultural practices."
"Diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells undergo meiosis when they are starved of nitrogen in the presence of a non-fermentable carbon source. Nutrient starvation triggers expression of Ime1, a master regulatory protein required to activate transcription of meiotic ""early genes"" that mediate premeiotic S phase and prophase I processes, including recombination and chromosome synapsis. During prophase I, the highly conserved, toposomerase-like protein, Spo11, creates double strand breaks that are used to identify homologous chromosomes and generate crossovers between them. DNA:RNA hybrids are formed when an RNA molecule anneals to a complementary strand of DNA and are present at the ends of double strand breaks during prophase I of meiosis in a variety of organisms. DNA:RNA hybrids can be removed by degradation of the RNA by RNase H or by unwinding of the RNA by an essential, multi-functional DNA:RNA helicase called Sen1. Sen1 is orthologous to the mammalian Senataxin (SETX) helicase. Phenotypic characterization of mouse mutants lacking either Senataxin or RNase H activity exhibit male infertility and defects in double strand break repair. SETX is also required for meiotic sex chromosome inactivation, making it unclear whether SETXs role in meiotic recombination is direct or an indirect consequence due to defects in SETX functions that affect transcription. Using a variety of orthogonal approaches, this work demonstrates that SEN1 has multiple, temporally distinct roles that promote yeast meiosis. First, it enables the timely expression of IME1-regulated early genes. Second, it helps prevent and/or remove DNA:RNA hybrids that form during premeiotic S phase. Third, it facilitates both repair of Spo11 generated double strand breaks generated during prophase I and chromosome synapsis.

AUTHOR SUMMARYDNA:RNA hybrids are unusual structures found throughout the genomes of many species, including yeast and mammals. While DNA:RNA hybrids may promote various cellular functions, persistent hybrids lead to double strand breaks, resulting in genomic instability. DNA:RNA hybrid formation and removal are therefore highly regulated by enzymes that either degrade or unwind RNA from the hybrid. Meiosis is the specialized cell division that creates haploid gametes for sexual reproduction. Previous work in yeast and mammals showed that elimination of DNA:RNA hybrids by RNase H facilitates meiotic recombination. This work demonstrates that the conserved Sen1 DNA:RNA helicase regulates the presence of DNA:RNA hybrids in three temporally distinct processes during yeast meiosis. First, SEN1 allows for meiosis-specific genes to be expressed at the proper time to allow entry into meiosis. Second, SEN1 prevents the accumulation of hybrids during premeiotic DNA replication. Third, SEN1 promotes the repair of programmed meiotic double strand breaks that are necessary to form crossovers between homologous chromosomes to allow their proper segregation at the first meiotic division. Given the evolutionary conservation of Sen1 with its mammalian counterpart, Senataxin, studies of Sen1 function in yeast are likely to be informative about the regulation of DNA:RNA hybrids during humans as well."
"Potassium (K+) channels are widely distributed in many types of organisms. They combine high efficiency ([~]100 pS) and K+/Na+ selectivity by a conserved selectivity filter (SF). Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations can provide detailed, atomistic mechanisms of this sophisticated ion permeation. However, currently there are clear inconsistencies between computational predictions and experimental results. Firstly, the ion occupancy of the SF in simulations is lower than expected ([~]2.5 in MD compared to [~]4 in X-ray crystallography). Secondly, in many reported MD simulations of K+ channels, K+ conductance is typically an order of magnitude lower than experimental values. This discrepancy is in part because the force fields used in MD simulations of potassium channels do not account for polarization. One of the proposed solutions is the Electronic Continuum Correction (ECC), a force field modification that scales down formal charges, to introduce the polarization in a mean-field way. When the ECC is used in conjunction with the Charmm36m force field, the simulated K+ conductance increases 13-fold. Following the analysis of ion occupancy states using Hamiltonian Replica Exchange (HRE) simulations, we propose a new parameter set for Amber14sb, that also leads to a similar increase in conductance. These two force fields are then used to compute, for the first time, the full current-voltage (I-V) curves from MD simulations, approaching quantitative agreement with experiments at all voltages. In general, the ECC-enabled simulations are in excellent agreement with experiment, in terms of ion occupancy, conductance, current-voltage response, and K+/Na+ selectivity.

Significance StatementPotassium (K+) channels are essential membrane proteins that facilitate the selective conduction of K+ ions while excluding Na+ ions. Incorporation of electronic polarization effects through the Electronic Continuum Correction (ECC) method enables molecular dynamics simulations to reproduce rapid K+ permeation under physiological voltage conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that employing ECC approximated polarization in molecular dynamics simulations allows for the prediction of multiple channel properties: conductance, ion occupancy, voltage response, and selectivity, with unprecedented accuracy. Furthermore, our simulations provide atomistic insights into the asymmetrical current-voltage (I-V) relationship observed in the MthK channel."
"Recognition of specific DNA sequences by transcription factors (TFs) is a key step in transcriptional control of gene expression. While most forkhead (FH) TFs bind either an FKH (RYAAAYA) or an FHL (GACGC) recognition motif, some FHs can bind both motifs. Mechanisms that control whether a FH is monospecific versus bispecific have remained unknown. Screening a library of 12 reference FH proteins, 61 naturally occurring missense variants including clinical variants, and 22 designed mutant FHs for DNA binding activity using universal (""all 10-mer"") protein binding microarrays (PBMs) revealed non-DNA-contacting residues that control mono- versus bispecificity. Variation in non-DNA-contacting amino acid residues of TFs is associated with human traits and may play a role in the evolution of TF DNA binding activities and gene regulatory networks.

"Many market classes of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) have a significant reduction in crop value due to the postharvest darkening of the seed coat. Seed coat darkening is caused by an elevated accumulation and oxidation of proanthocyanidins (PAs). In common bean, the major color gene P encodes for a bHLH protein with its Psdallele controlling the postharvest slow darkening seed coat trait. In the present investigation, we determined that P, PvMYB3A, and PvWD9 are the essential components that form a protein complex and regulate PA biosynthesis in pinto beans. P does not bind with the PA biosynthetic gene Anthocyanin Reductase (PvANR) promoter but regulates its expression by interacting with PvMYB3A, which directly binds to the PvANR promoter. PvWD9 is an essential member of the core protein complex, which requires one or more additional plant components in order to interact with its partner proteins P and PvMYB3A and create a functioning complex. The Psd isoform affects the accumulation of PA by functioning in a similar manner to its isoform P, albeit at a lower efficiency. Understanding the regulation of PA biosynthesis in common beans helps to explain variances in seed coat color and issues associated with darkening after harvest.

HighlightColor and pattern of the common bean seed coat are important traits in bean breeding, which is determined by level of proanthocyanidins (PA). This study provides experimental evidence for the regulation of PA biosynthesis in common beans by the P-PvMYB3A-PvWD9 complex together with some yet unknown associated protein(s). In the slow darkening beans, substitution of P with its slow dakening isoform Psd reduces the target biosynthetic gene expression inflencing PA production."
"The emergence of insecticide resistance is threatening the efforts of malaria control programmes, which rely heavily on a limited arsenal of insecticidal tools, such as insecticide-treated bed nets. Importantly, genomic surveillance of malaria vectors can provide critical, policy-relevant insights into the presence and evolution of insecticide resistance, allowing us to maintain and extend the shelf life of these interventions. Yet the complex genetic architecture of resistance, combined with resource constraints in malaria-endemic settings, have thus far precluded the widespread use of genomics in routine surveillance. Meanwhile, stakeholders in sub-Saharan Africa are moving towards locally driven, decentralised generation of genomic data, underscoring the need for standardised and robust genomics workflows. To address this need, we demonstrate an approach to targeted genomic surveillance in Anopheles gambiae s.l with Illumina sequencing. We target 90 genomic loci in the Anopheles gambiae s.l genome, including 55 resistance-associated mutations and 35 ancestry informative markers. This protocol is coupled with advanced, automated software for accurate and reproducible variant analysis. We are able to elucidate population structure and ancestry in our cohorts and accurately identify most species in the An. gambiae species complex. We report frequencies of variants at insecticide-resistance loci and explore the continued evolution of the pyrethroid target site, the Voltage-gated sodium channel. Applying the platform to a recently established colony of field-caught resistant mosquitoes (Siaya, Kenya), we identified seven independent resistance-associated variants contributing to reduced efficacy of insecticide-treated nets in East Africa. Additionally, we leverage a machine learning algorithm (XGBoost) to demonstrate the possibility of predicting bioassay mortality using genotypes alone. This achieved high accuracy (75%), demonstrating the potential of targeted genomics to predictively monitor insecticide resistance. Together these tools provide a practical, scalable solution for resistance monitoring while advancing the goal of building local genomic surveillance capacity in sub-Saharan Africa."
"The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is involved in feeding, reward, aversion, and anxiety-like behavior. We identify BNST neurons defined by the expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 3, VGluT3. VGluT3 neurons were localized to anteromedial BNST, were molecularly distinct from accumbal VGluT3 neurons, and co-express vesicular GABA transporter (VGaT). Cell-type specific presynaptic processes were identified in arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), regions critical for feeding and homeostatic regulation. Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology revealed that, while these neurons co-express VGluT3 and VGaT, they functionally transmit GABA to both ARC and PVN, with rare glutamate co-transmission to ARC. Neuronal recordings of VGluT3 BNST neurons showed greater calcium-dependent signaling in response to sucrose consumption while sated compared with fasted. When fasted, optogenetic stimulation of BNST VGluT3 neurons decreased sucrose consumption using several stimulation conditions but not when stimulation occurred prior to sucrose access, suggesting that BNST VGluT3 activation concurrent with consumption in the fasted state reduces feeding. BNST VGluT3 activation during anxiety-like paradigms (novelty-suppressed feeding, open field, and elevated zero maze) and real-time place conditioning resulted in no changes in anxiety-like or reward/aversion behavior. We interpret these data such that VGluT3 BNST neurons represent a unique cellular population within the BNST that provides inhibitory input to hypothalamic regions to decrease feeding without affecting anxiety-like or reward/aversion behavior."
"Whether interspecific competition is a major contributing factor in setting species range limits has been debated for a long time. Theoretical studies using evolutionary models have proposed that the interaction between interspecific competition and disruptive gene flow along an environmental gradient can halt range expansion of ecologically related species where they meet. However, the stability of such range limits has not been well addressed. We use a deterministic model of adaptive range evolution to show that the range limits set by interspecific competition are unlikely to be evolutionarily stable if the environmental optima for fitness-related traits vary linearly in space. However, we demonstrate that environmental nonlinearities such as ""knees"" and ""wiggles"", wherein an isolated sharp change or a step-like change occurs in the steepness of a trait optimum, can stabilize competitively formed range limits. We show that the stability of the range limits established at such nonlinearities is robust against moderate environmental disturbances. Although strong climatic changes can still destabilize the range limits, such destabilization depends on how the relative dominance of the competing species changes across the environmental nonlinearity. Therefore, our results highlight the importance of measuring the competitive ability of species when predicting their response to climate change."
"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common human cancer, is driven by hyperactivation of Hedgehog Smoothened (SMO) and GLI transcription. Gs and protein kinase A (PKA) negatively regulate Hedgehog signaling, offering an alternative BCC development and treatment pathway. Here, using histology alongside bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, we find that mouse BCC-like tumors that originate from Gs pathway inactivation are strikingly similar to those driven by canonical Hedgehog SMO. Interestingly, mutations that reduce Gs and PKA activity are present in human BCC. Tumors from Gs pathway inactivation are independent of the canonical Hedgehog regulators SMO and GPR161, establishing them as an SMO-independent oncogenic Hedgehog signaling model. Finally, we demonstrate that activation of the Gs-coupled adenosine 2B receptor counteracts oncogenic SMO, reducing Hedgehog signaling and tumor formation and offering a potential therapeutic strategy for BCC."
"Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies measure gene expression across thousands of spatial locations within a tissue slice. Multiple SRT technologies are currently available and others are in active development with each technology having varying spatial resolution (subcellular, single-cell, or multicellular regions), gene coverage (targeted vs. whole-transcriptome), and sequencing depth per location. For example, the widely used 10x Genomics Visium platform measures whole transcriptomes from multiple-cell-sized spots, while the 10x Genomics Xenium platform measures a few hundred genes at subcellular resolution. A number of studies apply multiple SRT technologies to slices that originate from the same biological tissue. Integration of data from different SRT technologies can overcome limitations of the individual technologies enabling the imputation of expression from unmeasured genes in targeted technologies and/or the deconvolution of ad-mixed expression from technologies with lower spatial resolution. We introduce Spatial Integration for Imputation and Deconvolution (SIID), an algorithm to reconstruct a latent spatial gene expression matrix from a pair of observations from different SRT technologies. SIID leverages a spatial alignment and uses a joint non-negative factorization model to accurately impute missing gene expression and infer gene expression signatures of cell types from ad-mixed SRT data. In simulations involving paired SRT datasets from different technologies (e.g., Xenium and Visium), SIID shows superior performance in reconstructing spot-to-cell-type assignments, recovering cell-type-specific gene expression, and imputing missing data compared to contemporary tools. When applied to real-world 10x Xenium-Visium pairs from human breast and colon cancer tissues, SIID achieves highest performance in imputing holdout gene expression. A PyTorch implementation of SIID is available at https://github.com/raphael-group/siid."
"Odor naming is considered a particularly challenging cognitive test, but the underlying cause of this difficulty is unknown. People often fail to report any source label to identify common odors, resulting in omissions (i.e., a lack of response). Here, with the support of a computational model, we offer a hypothesis about the neural network mechanisms underlying odor naming omissions. Based on an evaluation of behavioral data from almost 40,000 odor naming attempts, we suggest that high omission rates are driven by odors that are referred to by multiple linguistic labels. To explain this observation at the systems level, where olfactory perception and language (semantic) processing are produced by interacting cortical systems, we developed a computational model consisting of two associatively coupled attractor memory networks (odor and language networks), and investigated the effect of Hebbian-like learning on the simulated task performance. We used distributed network representations for the odor percepts and word label mental objects, and accounted for their statistical inter-relationships (correlations) extracted from collected data on odor perceptual similarity, and from a large Swedish odor language corpus, respectively. We evaluated a novel hypothesis, that Bayesian-Hebbian synaptic plasticity mechanisms can explain behavioral omissions in odor naming tasks, casting new light on the underlying mechanisms of this frequently observed memory phenomenon. Due to the nature of Bayesian-Hebbian associative learning connecting the two networks, there was a progressively weaker coupling for odors paired with multiple different labels in the encoding process (one-to-many mapping). Thus, when the model was cued with perceptual odor stimuli that established multiple word label associations (one-to-many mapping), the olfactory language network often produced subthreshold network responses, resulting in elevated omissions (opposite to one-to-few mapping scenario that led to improved performance scores). Our results are of theoretical interest, as they suggest a biologically plausible mechanism to explain a common, but poorly understood, behavioral phenomenon."
"Parathyroid hormone 4 (Pth4) is an evolutionarily conserved member of the PTH family, expressed in hypothalamic neurons and lost in eutherian mammals. In order to elucidate its role in mineral homeostasis and skeletal development, a pth4 knockout (pth4KO) zebrafish line was generated using CRISPR/Cas9 and transcriptomic profiling was conducted across six key tissues: brain, kidney, intestine, gills, scales, and bone. The results obtained demonstrated that the loss of Pth4 led to pronounced disturbances in calcium and phosphate homeostasis, skeletal deformities, and widespread tissue-specific transcriptional alterations. Notably, dysregulation of mineral regulatory genes-- such as fgf23, phex, and slc34a1a was particularly evident in the kidney, suggesting disruption of the FGF23-Klotho axis. In parallel, differential expression of extracellular matrix genes (col1a1a, col10a1a, col11a1) and matrix remodeling enzymes (mmp9, mmp13a, mmp2) in bone and scales indicated impaired skeletal remodeling. Together, these findings highlight a pivotal role for Pth4 in the endocrine and local regulation of mineral metabolism and skeletal integrity, expanding our understanding of PTH family functions in vertebrate physiology."
"Genomic DNA used as a template for in vitro transcription of RNA can serve as a true negative control for RNA modification detection in Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS) data. We generated DRS for IVT RNA composed of canonical nucleotides using genomic DNA templates. We applied Dorado modification calling models to these data, which allowed for the calculation of 9-mer specific false positive rates for a set of RNA modifications. These false positive rates capture the complete set of 9-mer sequence contexts and can be applied to a broad range of experimental conditions.

"Voltage-gated sodium channels initiate action potentials and control electrical signaling throughout the animal kingdom. Fast inactivation is an essential auto-inhibitory mechanism and requisite component of sodium channel physiology. Recent structural and electrophysiological results are inconsistent with the canonical ""ball and chain"" model of fast inactivation thus necessitating an updated theoretical framework. Here, we use encoded fluorescence spectroscopy and high-resolution electrophysiology to capture key steps in the fast inactivation mechanism, from voltage-sensor activation to pore occlusion, an ultra-fast process which occurs in less than 2 milliseconds. Upon depolarization, activation of the domain IV voltage sensor initiates cytoplasmic DIII_DIV linker movement and quickly repositions the IFM motif into a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the pore. This triggers a structural rearrangement of the pocket. The phenylalanine of the IFM motif contacts the pore-forming helices via a hydrophobic interaction with S6 of DIV and an aromatic/hydrophobic interaction with S6 of DIIII. These two interactions occur only after both S6 segments rotate, thus exposing the hydrophobic gate into the pore producing the fast inactivation. Based on the current results, we propose an alternative ""lock and key"" model to explain the molecular mechanism of fast inactivation."
"The heat shock response (HSR) is a conserved cellular mechanism critical for adaptation to environmental and physiological stressors, with broad implications for cell survival, immune responses, and cancer biology. While the HSR has been extensively studied at the proteomic and transcriptomic levels, the role of lipid metabolism and membrane reorganization remains underexplored. Here, we integrate mass spectrometry-based lipidomics with RNA sequencing to characterize global lipidomic and transcriptomic changes in HeLa cells exposed to three conditions: control, heat shock (HS), and HS with eight hours of recovery. Heat shock-induced extensive lipid remodeling, including significant increases in fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids, with partial normalization during recovery. Transcriptomic analysis identified over 2,700 upregulated and 2,300 downregulated genes under heat shock, with GO enrichment suggesting potential transcriptional contributions to lipid metabolism. However, transcriptional changes alone did not fully explain the observed lipidomic shifts, suggesting additional layers of regulation. Joint pathway analysis revealed enrichment in glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, while network analysis identified lipid transport regulators (STAB2, APOB), stress-linked metabolic nodes (KNG1), and persistent sphingolipid enrichment during recovery. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding lipid-mediated mechanisms of the HSR and highlight the importance of multi-omics integration in stress adaptation and disease biology."
"Heritability is a fundamental parameter of diseases and other traits, quantifying the contribution of genetics to that trait. Kinship matrices, also known as Genetic Relatedness Matrices or ""GRMs"", are required for heritability estimation with variance components models. However, the most common ""standard"" kinship estimator employed by GCTA and other approaches, can be severely biased in structured populations. In this study, we characterize heritability estimation biases in GCTA due to kinship estimation biases under population structure. For the standard ratio-of-means (ROM) kinship estimator, we derive a closed-form expression for heritability bias given by the mean kinship value and the true heritability. The standard mean-of-ratios (MOR) estimator is the most widely used in practice, and exhibits more severe bias than ROM due to upweighing low-frequency variants. Using simulation studies with admixture and family structures, as well as simulated traits from 1000 Genomes genotypes, we find that only Popkin, which is the only unbiased population kinship estimator, produces unbiased heritability estimates in structured settings. Pedigree-only estimates have upward heritability biases when there is population structure. Finally, we analyze three structured datasets with real phenotypes--the San Antonio Family Study, the Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos, and a multiethnic Nephrotic Syndrome cohort. The standard MOR estimator can produce both downward and upward heritability biases depending on population structure and variant frequency spectrum, compared to the other two estimators. Overall, common kinship estimators result in heritability estimation biases when applied to structured populations, a challenge that Popkin successfully overcomes."
"Human postmortem brain tissues provide an indispensable resource that is crucial for the understanding of neurological conditions, whether related to pathology subtype, burden, distribution or cell-type specificity. Pathology staging protocols provide guidelines for standardized sampling of brain tissues, but cover only a subset of regions affected by pathologies. Thus, to study how various neuropathologies and cell types in highly specialized circuit nodes correlate with functions specifically served by these nodes, additional protocols are necessary. This especially applies to brainstem tissues due to the small dimension of regions of interest and interindividual variability of specimens, whether due to procurement or intrinsic differences.

Here we systematically assessed factors contributing to heterogeneity in the length of whole brainstem samples and then presented a standardized approach to reproducibly assign rostrocaudal levels, with standardization relying upon readily identifiable internal landmarks. We validated this approach using postmortem MRI imaging. Standardized brainstem length correlated positively with subject height and negatively with subject age of death. By providing a reference series, reproducible levels can be assigned to individual histological sections or MRI images, i.e. when full brainstem specimens are not available and irrespective of platform, promoting reproducibility."
"Molecular imaging of immune activation holds tremendous potential for the development of novel immunotherapy. In particular, chemical probes capable of detecting immune responses before changes in tumor size occur can guide early therapeutic strategies. Here, we present quenched activity-based probes targeting granzymes as a biomarker of antitumor immunity. Through optimization of peptide recognition element and functional chemical warhead, we have developed an optical imaging probe Cy5-IEPCyaPhP-QSY21, which rapidly reacts with GzmB at substoichiometric concentrations and enables efficient, selective labeling of the active enzyme in a complex proteome. With high specificity and minimal background signal, this probe produces GzmB-induced near-infrared fluorescence signals in the tumors of living mice shortly after injection. Both in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence signals correlate with GzmB expression and activity, and the population of CD8+ cells in tumor tissues. Moreover, it demonstrates the potential to track tumor response to immunotherapy. Thus, this study offers a chemical tool for assessing immune-mediated anticancer activity using noninvasive optical imaging.

"Memories of pain can last a lifetime, preventing future injuries, but this comes at the expense of remembering other concurrent experiences. For acute pain this cost is outweighed by the benefits but when pain is chronic, pain memory benefits are limited and may even contribute to maintenance of the disorder. Here we investigated two hypotheses, (1) pain takes up slots in working memory or (2) pain induces arousal above optimum levels at high task difficulty, leading to a decrease in performance. To do this, we used the Sternberg Task of working memory, in which the participant plays repeated trials where they are shown different sets of numbers and then asked to identify whether a  probe number was in the set or not. The Sternberg Task is ideal for testing the two hypotheses by looking at pain-related changes in accuracy and response time. There was a replication of the response time increase with set size, as well as the effect of older age on working memory and pain threshold. However, we saw no pain effect on either response time, accuracy, or the relationship between these parameters and set size with either chronic pain or an acute painful thermal stimulus. Together, this suggests that pain does not impair working memory in the Sternberg Task."
"Mitochondrial proteases regulate the dynamic properties of organelle morphology and ensure functional plasticity at the cellular level. The metalloprotease OMA1 mediates constitutive and stress-inducible processing of its mitochondrial substrates, but the number of functionally characterized targets remains limited. Using multiproteomic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrated that the membrane-anchored inner membrane space (IMS) protein AIFM1 serves as a mitochondrial stress-responsive substrate of OMA1. OMA1 cleaves AIFM1 in the IMS under stress conditions with a kinetically slower reaction than that of its conventional substrate, dynamin-like GTPase OPA1. Membrane dislocation of cleaved AIFM1 in mitochondria reduces its binding to subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, leading to decreased respiratory activity and ultimately impaired cell growth. Mechanistically, we revealed that AIFM1 broadly safeguards the mitochondrial proteome under steady-state conditions by mediating the import of proteins, particularly respiratory complex I subunits, via the TIM23 complex. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for OMA1 in integrating mitochondrial stress sensing and cellular energetics by altering the AIFM1 topology."
"Matrix-M(R) adjuvant, containing saponins, delivers a potent adjuvant effect and good safety profile. Given that Matrix-M is composed of Matrix-A and Matrix-C particles, comprising different saponin fractions, understanding their distinct roles can provide deeper insight into the mechanism of action of Matrix-M and guide future applications. Here, we demonstrate that antigen and Matrix-M, Matrix-A, or Matrix-C colocalize in lysosomes following uptake by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Matrix-M, Matrix-A, and Matrix-C induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), but Matrix-C shows the highest LMP potential. LMP is required for interleukin (IL)-1{beta} and IL-18 secretion in vitro. In vivo, a robust adjuvant effect of Matrix-M, Matrix-A, and Matrix-C is observed, both in the presence and absence of the NLRP3 inflammasome. LMP induced by Matrix-M, as well as Matrix-A and Matrix-C, also enables antigen cross-presentation. Thus, Matrix-induced LMP explains the capability of Matrix-M- adjuvanted protein vaccines to induce CD8+ T-cell responses."
"Mosquito dispersal plays an important role in mosquito ecology and mosquito-borne pathogen transmission. While reaction-diffusion and patch-based models with simple flux assumptions for emigration have played a predominant role in modeling mosquito dispersal, mosquito behavioral ecology - in particular, the process of searching for resources - is usually ignored by diffusion-based models. We thus set out to analyze mosquito movement using highly mimetic models, to see what we could learn from a different approach. Here, we explore mosquito dispersal in behavioral state microsimulation models, in which mosquitoes are in behavioral states and search for the required resources that are distributed on a landscape. Models of this sort are laborious and challenging to work with, so we developed ramp.micro, an R package to build, solve, analyze, and visualize behavioral state microsimulation models for mosquitoes. We show that even when resources are distributed randomly and uniformly, mosquito populations tend to form highly spatially structured communities. We also show that some heterogeneity in mosquito population densities is attributed to features of a network defined by searching and the spatial distribution of resources. These models highlight the importance of understanding mosquito behaviors and resource availability as factors structuring mosquito population movement. Motivated by these dynamics, spatial models for mosquito ecology and mosquito-borne pathogen transmission would benefit from considering resource availability as a factor affecting mosquito movement and dispersal.

Author summaryWe develop highly realistic population dynamic models for mosquito behavioral ecology where mosquitoes move around on landscapes made up of resource point sets. The mosquitoes are in behavioral states - blood feeding, egg laying, or sugar feeding - and they end each search at a point where the resource they need can be found. Even with simple resource landscapes, mosquito populations are highly structured. Because mosquitoes tend to leave areas that lack a resource, and they tend to stay in areas that have all required resources, the scarcest resources end up determining the structure of mosquito populations."
"Non-visual saccades (NVS) are spontaneous eye movements humans make while thinking. Their role is puzzling and there is no framework to explain them in terms of their underlying neural systems. Here we studied neural activity preceding NVS when subjects performed standardized abstract thinking tasks. We used high-density EEG and focused on frontal and parietal channels representing oculomotor cortical areas. We found that NVS are preceded by neural activity changes in frontal and parietal EEG channels qualitatively different to that for voluntary saccades. However, only the rate of signal change in frontal channels, but not in parietal channels, surpassed that observed when comparing NVS to normal saccades. Frequency spectrum analyses showed activity patterns reflecting complex top-down and bottom-up processing. A source reconstruction analysis additionally revealed that presaccadic signals originated mainly in the premotor cortex. We propose that this presaccadic activity while thinking represents evidence accumulation and attentional shifts, as shown before in the premotor cortex during sensorimotor tasks. Our findings suggest that human thinking appears to function similarly to human actions and employs premotor areas responsible for evaluating and manipulating objects also when evaluating and manipulating concepts."
"Plants can ""cry for help"" to recruit supportive microbiome members during stressful conditions. We evaluated the activation dynamics of root zone soil bacteria in response to phytohormones produced when plants are stressed, hypothesizing that the activated taxa support plant resilience. We conducted a 2-week laboratory experiment using mesocosms of root zone soil collected from two different crops: the annual legume common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and the perennial grass switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). We inactivated the microbiome by drying and then treated the soils with either abscisic acid, salicylic acid, a carrier control (methanol), or water, and then quantified the reactivation dynamics of bacterial populations over time, at one, 7, and 14 days after phytohormone addition, using amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA and rDNA. There were several Actinobacterial taxa that switched from an average population-inactive to a population-active state after exposure to abscisic acid and salicylic acid, with Microbispora lineages switching especially noted. Some taxa were activated only in one crops soil, and some were activated in both crops soils in response to the same phytohormone. This work suggests that different bacteria have different specificities to phytohormones as plant stress signals and provides insights into understanding the mechanisms by which stressed plants may ""cry for help"" to recruit bacteria from the root zone to the rhizosphere.

ImportanceGlobal food security is an urgent societal challenge that has been intensified by climate change and other anthropogenic stressors placed on the environment. Microbial bioinoculants are a promising solution to improve crop health and resilience, but ensuring their persistence and activation in the field remains a challenge. This study examined how dormant root-zone associated bacteria reactivate after exposure to the plant stress hormones abscisic acid and salicylic acid. The experiment revealed that certain bacteria taxa could reactivate in response to these plant stress signals and persist for at least two weeks. This work advances understanding of the potential cues for reactivation of beneficial plant-associated microbes and supports goals toward developing microbial solutions for sustainable agriculture."
"Direct reciprocity requires the beneficiarys real-time evaluation of others altruistic behaviors under exogenous uncertainty, i.e., environmentally imposed uncertainty that can be resolved upon the disclosure of outcomes (e.g., uncertainty in others cost to rescue oneself in a natural disaster). However, the neurocognitive mechanisms underpinning this dynamic adjustment to exogenous uncertainty fluctuations remain unexplored. Combining interpersonal tasks simulating exogenous uncertainty-to-certainty transitions with one fMRI experiment applying multivariate pattern analyses and three behavioral experiments, we uncover an adaptive asymmetric adjustment in the beneficiarys affective evaluation and reciprocity in response to altruistic behaviors: the beneficiarys gratitude and ensuing reciprocity intensify when the final benefactor-cost (or self-benefit) exceeds the expectation under exogenous uncertainty; however, a parallel reduction in benefactor-cost (or self-benefit) does not elicit equivalent decreases. This asymmetric adjustment, perceived as morally superior by third parties, challenges classical theories of gratitude, decision-making, and social learning involving uncertainty. We resolve this paradox by proposing a mechanism of prosocial information integration: guided by the adaptive goal (e.g., gathering social acceptance), the beneficiary tends to asymmetrically weigh prior information (e.g., the cost the benefactor willing to undertake under uncertainty) against posterior information (e.g., final benefactors cost) when evaluating benefactors intention, contributing to the observed adaptive asymmetry in gratitude and reciprocity dynamics. This process is supported by neural representations within the theory-of-mind system, particularly the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. By reframing direct reciprocity as a dynamic process shaped by prosocial information integration, this work extends the theoretical framework of cooperation under uncertainty, offering new insights into human social adaptation.

Significance StatementDespite extensive research on endogenous uncertainty in beliefs about others in direct reciprocity, how beneficiaries dynamically evaluate and respond to altruistic behaviors under environmentally imposed exogenous uncertainty fluctuations remains unknown. We uncover an adaptive asymmetric adjustment in this dynamic process, which challenges classical theories of gratitude, decision-making, and social learning regarding endogenous uncertainty. This asymmetric adjustment arises from prosocial information integration, wherein beneficiaries asymmetrically integrate prior and posterior information regarding exogenous uncertainty fluctuations to sustain social acceptance. This process is underpinned by theory-of-mind related neural representations, particularly the dmPFC. By redefining direct reciprocity as a context-sensitive process driven by adaptive goals, this work provides new perspectives for understanding cooperation in uncertain environments and informs strategies to foster prosociality."
"We have recently identified ERF transcription factor PTI5 as a susceptibility factor, negatively regulating immune response to diverse pathogens. Here we investigated the processes involved in colonisation of potato with beneficial organisms. RNAseq showed that at the time of Bacillus subtilis biofilm establishment, immune responses in interacting roots were attenuated, and complex transcriptional network was triggered, with ethylene signalling being a central module and PTI5 strongly induced. Interestingly, the response is intensified if plants are inoculated by two antagonistic B. subtilis strains. While PTI5 is not involved in the establishment of biofilm on roots, we show that bacterial abundance increases in PTI5-silenced plants. Remarkably, root colonization by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis was also higher in the PTI5-silenced plants. PTI5 is thus involved both in blocking defence against harmful and blocking colonisation with beneficial microbes. Such mechanistic understanding of plant-microbe interaction paves the way for sustainable crop management."
"The introduction of AlphaFold has fundamentally changed our ability to predict the structure of proteins from their primary sequence of amino acids. As machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) based protein prediction continues to advance, we examine the potential of hybrid techniques that combine experiment and computation that may yield more accurate structures than AI alone with significantly reduced experimental burden. We have developed heuristics comparing N-edited NOESY spectra and AlphaFold predicted structures that seek to determine whether the predicted structure reasonably describes the structure of the protein which generated the NOESY. We present a large collection of data connecting entries across the BMRB, PDB and AlphaFold Database that includes experimentally derived structures and corresponding spectra, establishing it as a means to develop and test hybrid methods utilizing AlphaFold and NMR spectra to perform structure determination. These data test the new heuristics ability to identify inaccurate AlphaFold structures. A support vector machine was developed to test the consistency of NMR data with predicted structure and we show its application to the structure of an unsolved engineered protein, LoTOP."

Although GSDMD-mediated excessive pyroptosis promotes pathogen dissemination and tissue damage in tuberculosis, the mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the effector EccB5, a component of the Mtb ESX-5 secretion system, as a key driver of pyroptosis and hyperinflammatory responses. EccB5 enhances Mtb virulence by inducing pyroptosis of macrophages, promoting bacterial dissemination and exacerbating lung pathology. Conditional knockdown EccB5 increases host cell viability. Mechanistically, EccB5 directly interacts with GSDMD, strengthens its association with caspase-1, and facilitates caspase-1-mediated cleavage of GSDMD both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, our findings uncover a precise mechanism by which Mtb modulates host responses and advances its pathogenicity."
"The niche environment surrounding intestinal stem cells (ISCs) varies along the length of intestine and provides key cues that regulate stem cell fate. Here, we investigated the role of cellular redox balance in colonic ISC function. We show that hypoxia and Wnt signaling synergize to restrict the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating enzyme NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) to the crypt base in the distal colon. NOX1 function maintains a more oxidative cell state that licenses cell cycle entry, altering the balance of asymmetric stem cell self-renewal and directing lineage commitment. Mechanistically, cell redox state directs a self-reinforcing circuit that connects hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1)-dependent signaling with regulation of the metabolic enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1). Our studies show that cellular redox balance is a central and niche-dependent regulator of epithelial homeostasis and regeneration and provide a basis for understanding disease propensity in the distal large intestine.

"Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by craniofacial deformities. Although mutations in several genes involved in ribosome biogenesis have been identified in patients with TCS, the molecular mechanisms by which these mutations exert their effects remain poorly understood. In this study, we established Schizosaccharomyces pombe models for TCS type 4 (TCS4) by introducing specific mutations in the rpa2 gene, which encodes Rpa2, the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase I (Pol I). TCS4-associated rpa2R1022C and rpa2R1022S mutations impaired cell growth without altering Rpa2 protein levels. These mutants were defective in 35S pre-rRNA biogenesis and were sensitive to the Pol I inhibitor BMH-21. These findings underscore the essential role of Rpa2 residues associated with TCS4 in rRNA transcription and cell growth."
"Dimerization plays a pivotal role in target-binding interactions among various transcription factors (TFs), including bZIPs, bHLHs, MYBs, and zinc finger TFs. The bZIP family is defined by an -helix class of TFs containing a basic region that binds to the major groove of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), followed by a leucine zipper motif that mediates dimerization through coiled-coil structures, forming homo- or heterodimers. In polyploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum cv.), bZIPs and their homeologs interact through the dimerization motifs to form specific bZIP pairs with distinct regulatory functions. The dimerization pattern of bZIPs is critical for gene regulation, however, the mechanisms underlying their specificity remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on the dimerization specificity of coiled-coil - helical bZIP proteins in bread wheat, highlighting the leucine zipper region as a key dimerization motif. We identified 265 bZIPs containing the bZIP motif, following dimerization criteria established in humans, Drosophila, and Arabidopsis based on the presence of specific amino acids at the a, d, e, and g positions in heptads. Eight key bZIP TFs were cloned, expressed, and purified for the structural analysis. This study not only provides the dimerization trend exhibited by bZIPs during thermal stability analysis but also provides the reversibility pattern followed by the thermal denaturation exposure at 85{degrees}C. Our study also points towards that how amino acid substitutions and the length of the leucine zipper influence the formation of coiled-coil structures among bZIP homeologs of polyploid wheat. Overall, the study advances our understanding of the role of leucine zippers, in determining the specificity and stability of bZIP dimers, which in turn governs DNA binding and gene regulation in plants."
"Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne zoonosis with significant public health implications due to its expanding geographic distribution and potential for severe outcomes in humans. This study represents the first serological survey conducted in mainland France to detect antibodies against the Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV) in domestic and wild fauna, providing critical insights into the viruss circulation. We analyzed 8,609 cattle sera and 2,182 wildlife sera collected across the French Mediterranean region from 2008 to 2022, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and pseudo-plaque reduction neutralization tests (PPRNT) for antibody detection and confirmation. Seropositivity was detected in both cattle (2.04%) and wildlife (2.25%), with higher rates observed in specific regions such as Pyrenees-Orientales and Hautes-Pyrenees. These findings reveal spatial clusters of CCHFV circulation and suggest the existence of enzootic transmission cycles involving local tick vectors and animal hosts. Our multivariate analysis identified key factors influencing seropositivity, including animal age, habitat characteristics, and potential wildlife interactions. The presence of natural open habitats and coniferous forests was significantly associated with higher seropositivity in cattle, while sex and geographical variability played a role in wildlife seroprevalence. These findings highlight the importance of environmental and anthropogenic factors in shaping the dynamics of CCHFV transmission. This study demonstrates that CCHFV is actively circulating in parts of mainland France, emphasizing the need for enhanced surveillance and integrated approaches to monitor zoonotic pathogens. It also raises questions about the role of additional tick vectors, such as Hyalomma lusitanicum, in the transmission cycle. These results contribute to a better understanding of CCHF epidemiology and offer valuable guidance for public health strategies to mitigate the risks associated with this emerging disease.

Author SummaryCrimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a severe disease spread by ticks that affects humans and animals. Although the disease is largely distributed in parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia, its presence in France has been uncertain. My study investigated whether the virus causing this disease is circulating in southern mainland France by testing blood samples from domestic animals, like cattle, and wild animals, such as deer and wild boars, for signs of previous infection.

I found evidence of the virus in several regions, particularly in the Pyrenees-Orientales, Hautes-Pyrenees and Alpes-maritimes, suggesting that the virus is indeed circulating among animals and ticks in some parts of mainland France. By studying where infected animals were found and considering factors such as age, habitat, and environmental conditions, I identified that older animals seem to have been more often exposed to the virus, as well as animals frequenting open environments favorable to ticks.

These findings are important because they show that the disease could potentially spread to new areas and affect human populations. My work highlights the need for ongoing monitoring of ticks and animals for CCHFV epidemiological surveillance and the protection of public health."
"Vector-borne diseases have significant impacts on animal and human health globally, and these impacts are likely to increase in the future due to environmental and climate change. Understanding where to target surveillance and control measures to mitigate the impacts of emerging vector-borne diseases can be challenging when pathogens or disease is absent. In this study, we utilise a species distribution modelling approach previously applied to the UK to predict areas at higher risk of mosquito-borne disease across Europe, using West Nile Virus (WNV) as a case study. WNV is an Orthoflavivirus that is naturally transmitted between Culex mosquitoes and a range of avian species. However, it can spread to hosts such as humans and horses where it has the potential to lead to severe illness and mortality. Suitability predictions for Culex (Cx. pipiens and Cx. modestus) and avian hosts (mainly Passerine species) are made across Europe to determine potential risk of WNV circulation and establishment. These maps are then combined with information on human and horse density to determine risk to human and equine health. The resulting risk maps reveal that across Europe, there are areas of higher and lower risk that are predominantly driven by vector suitability as avian hosts are widespread. These predictions are projected into the future in 2100 using best- and worst-case Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1 and SSP5 respectively) to determine how risk may change over time, revealing that some areas see an increase in suitability for both vectors and hosts leading to higher risk (e.g., central England and northern Belgium) whilst other areas see a decline in suitability and consequently lower WNV risk (e.g., northern Italy and western Germany). Overall, this work will improve understanding of mosquito-borne disease risk in changing environments and demonstrates how species distribution modelling can be used to aid contingency preparedness by highlighting areas at higher risk of emerging disease."
"Most studies investigating the computational basis of decision confidence have focused on simple visual perceptual tasks, leaving open questions about how confidence is formed in decisions involving other sensory modalities or those requiring the integration of information across modalities. To address these gaps, we used computational modelling to analyse confidence judgements in perceptual decisions involving visual, auditory, and audio-visual stimuli. Drawing on research into visual confidence, we adapted models from the literature to evaluate their fit to our data, comparing three popular classes: unscaled evidence strength, scaled evidence strength, and Bayesian models. Our results show that the scaled evidence strength models consistently outperformed the other model classes across all tasks and could also be used to predict behaviour in the audio-visual task from the unidimensional auditory and visual model fits. These findings suggest that confidence judgements across different perceptual decisions rely on a shared algorithm that dynamically accounts for both sensory uncertainty and evidence strength, without the computation of posterior probabilities. Additionally, we investigated the algorithms used for multidimensional (audio-visual) confidence judgements specifically, showing that participants integrated both the visual and auditory dimensions of the stimulus, rather than relying solely on the most informative modality, and used a modality-independent measure of sensory uncertainty to adjust their confidence. Overall, our findings provide evidence for a common algorithm underlying confidence judgements across modalities and demonstrate the broad applicability of the scaled evidence strength algorithm, even in tasks requiring the integration of distinct sensory information."
"While rapid progress has been made to characterize the bacterial and archaeal populations of the rumen microbiome, insight into how they interact with keystone protozoal species remains elusive. Here, we reveal two distinct rumen community types (RCT-A and RCT-B) that are not strongly associated with host phenotype nor genotype but instead linked to protozoal community patterns. We leveraged a series of multi-omic datasets to show that the dominant Epidinium spp. in animals with RCT-B employ a plethora of fiber-degrading enzymes that present enriched Prevotella spp. a favorable carbon landscape to forage upon. Conversely, animals with RCT-A, dominated by genera Isotricha and Entodinium, harbor a more even distribution of fiber, protein, and amino acid metabolizers, reflected by higher detection of metabolites from both protozoal and bacterial activity. We reveal microbiome variation across key protozoal and bacterial populations is interlinked, which should act as an important consideration for future development of microbiome-based technologies."
"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) replication relies on the multifunctional nsP2 protein, making it an attractive target for antiviral drug discovery. Here, we report the resolution of oxaspiropiperidine 1, a first-in-class inhibitor of the CHIKV nsP2 RNA helicase (nsP2hel), into its constitutive enantiomers and characterization of their antiviral activity. The enantiomer (R)-1 exhibited potent inhibition of viral replication, nsP2hel ATPase activity, and dsRNA unwinding, while the (S)-1 enantiomer was >100-fold less active. The (R)-1 enantiomer also demonstrated high selectivity for CHIKV over other RNA viruses and for nsP2hel over other RNA helicases. Direct binding of (R)-1 to nsP2hel protein was confirmed by 19F NMR. Biophysical and structural studies revealed conformational polymorphism in the spirocyclic scaffold of (R)-1, suggesting a potential role of thermal mobility of the ligand in allosteric inhibition of nsP2hel. Collectively, these findings designate (R)-1 (RA-NSP2-1) as a high-quality chemical probe and (S)-1 (RA-NSP2-1N) as a negative control for probing the biology of alphavirus RNA helicases."
"The molecular basis of sex determination (SD), while being extensively studied in model organisms, remains poorly understood in many animal groups. Bivalves, a diverse class of molluscs with a variety of reproductive modes, represent an ideal yet challenging clade for investigating SD and the evolution of sexual systems. However, the absence of a comprehensive framework has limited progress in this field, particularly regarding the study of sex-determination related genes (SRGs). In this study, we performed a genome-wide sequence evolutionary analysis of the Dmrt, Sox, and Fox gene families in more than 40 bivalve species. For the first time, we provide an extensive and phylogenetic-aware dataset of these SRGs, and we find support to the hypothesis that Dmrt-1L and Sox-H may act as primary sex-determining genes, by showing their high levels of sequence diversity within the bivalve genomic context. To validate our findings, we studied the same gene families in two well-characterized systems, mammals and Drosophila. In the former, we found that the male sex-determining gene Sry exhibits a pattern of amino acid sequence diversity similar to that of Dmrt-1L and Sox-H in bivalves, consistent with its role of master SD regulator. In contrast, no such pattern was observed among genes of the fruit fly SD cascade, which is controlled by a chromosomic mechanism. Overall, our findings highlight similarities in the sequence evolution of some mammal and bivalve SRGs, possibly driven by a comparable architecture of SD cascades. This work underscores once again the importance of employing a comparative approach when investigating understudied and non-model systems."
"Sterols regulate cell membrane fluidity and are precursors for hormone and secondary metabolite production in plants, but plant sterols also have a critical role as nutrients in herbivores. Here we describe the distribution of 78 different sterols from pollen of 295 UK wildflower taxa and use this data to develop an evolutionary rationale for the diversity of sterols in pollen compared to vegetative tissues. The sterolome was a function of plant lineage and conserved in groups as high as subfamily. Insect herbivores are auxotrophic for sterols, and notably bees can not modify them therefore rely on dietary sources, primarily pollen, to meet their metabolic needs. Most pollen in the present study contained high proportions of {Delta}5 sterols including {beta}-sitosterol, 24-methylenecholesterol and isofucosterol, which are important sterols for bees. The sterols recorded in honey bees occurred in the pollen of only 68% of plant taxa, however, none matched these proportions exactly suggesting they must forage pollen from multiple plant taxa to satisfy their sterol requirements. We conclude that there is evidence for pollen sterol composition being the result of diverse driving forces including plant lineage and pollinator nutritional requirements."
"Red seaweeds form part of an ancient lineage of eukaryotes that were one of the first to evolve multicellularity. Although they share a common evolutionary origin with modern-day plants and display complex multicellular development, we still lack comprehensive genome data from the most highly-evolved groups of red algae. Here, we present a chromosome-level genome assembly of Bostrychia moritziana, a species that is classified into the Rhodomelaceae family of the Ceramiales order, both of which constitute the largest and most diverse family and order of red algae, respectively. Contrary to the commonly held view that red algae generally have small genomes, we report significant genome size expansion in Bostrychia and other Ceramiales species, which we posit as one of at least three independent genome expansion events that occurred during red algal evolution. Our analyses suggest that these expansions do not involve polyploidy or ancient whole genome duplications, but in the case of Bostrychia appear to be largely driven by the dramatic proliferation of a single lineage of giant Plavaka DNA transposons. Consistent with increased genome size, we identify a substantial increase in gene content in Bostrychia that was shaped both by de novo gene emergence and by the amplification of gene families in common with other Ceramiales seaweeds, providing key insight into the genetic adaptations underpinning the evolutionary success of this species-rich order. Finally, our sex-specific assemblies enabled us to resolve the UV sex chromosomes in Bostrychia, which feature expanded gene-rich sex-linked regions. Notably, these sex-linked regions each harbour a distinct TALE-HD transcription factor orthologous to ancient regulators of haploid-diploid transitions in other multicellular lineages. Together, our findings offer a unique perspective of the genomic adaptations driving red algal diversity and demonstrate how this highly successful group of red seaweeds can provide insight into the evolutionary origins and universal principles of complex multicellular plant life."
"Several studies have associated seminal microbiota abnormalities with male infertility but have yielded differing results owing to their limited sizes or depths of analyses. The semen microbiota during recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) has not been investigated. Comprehensively assessing the seminal microbiota in men with reproductive disorders could elucidate its potential role in clinical management. We used semen analysis, terminal-deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated-deoxyuridine-triphosphate-nick-end-labelling, Comet DNA fragmentation, luminol ROS chemiluminescence and metataxonomic profiling of semen microbiota by16S rRNA amplicon sequencing in this prospective, cross-section study to investigate composition and bacterial load of seminal bacterial genera and species, semen parameters, reactive oxidative species (ROS), and sperm DNA fragmentation in men with reproductive disorders and proven fathers. 223 men were enrolled included healthy men with proven paternity (n=63), the male partners in a couple encountering RPL (n=46), men with male factor infertility (n=58), and the male partners of couples unexplained infertility (n=56). Rates of high sperm DNA fragmentation, elevated ROS and oligospermia were more prevalent in the study group compared with control. In all groups, semen microbiota clustered into three major genera-dominant groups (1, Streptococcus; 2, Prevotella; 3, Lactobacillus and Gardnerella); no species clusters were identified. Group 2 had the highest microbial richness (P<0.001), alpha-diversity (P<0.001), and bacterial load (P<0.0001). Overall bacterial composition or load has not found to associate with semen analysis, ROS or DNA fragmentation. Whilst, global perturbation of the seminal microbiota is not associated with male reproductive disorders, men with unidentified seminal Flavobacterium are more likely to have abnormal seminal analysis. Future studies may elucidate if Flavobacterium reduction has therapeutic potential."
"Understanding and predicting cognitive decline in Alzheimers disease (AD) is crucial for timely intervention and management. While neuroimaging biomarkers and clinical assessments are valuable individually, their combined predictive power and interaction with demographic and cognitive variables remain underexplored. This study lays the groundwork for comprehensive longitudinal analyses by integrating neuroimaging markers and clinical data to predict cognitive changes over time. Using data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we applied feature-driven supervised machine learning techniques for assessing cognitive decline predictability. We hypothesize that combining neuroimaging biomarkers with demographic and clinical assessment variables significantly improves the prediction of cognitive decline in Alzheimers disease. Our results show that while imaging biomarkers alone offer moderate predictive capabilities, including key clinical assessment and demographic variables in conjunction with imaging biomarkers significantly improves the model performance. Furthermore, our results indicate that non-imaging variables alone can serve as effective and cost-efficient predictors of cognitive decline. This study underscores the need for integrating multi-dimensional data in future longitudinal research to capture time-dependent patterns in cognitive decline and guide the development of targeted intervention strategies. We also introduce NeuroLAMA - an open and extensible data engineering and machine-learning system, to support the continued investigation by the community"
"Microbiome composition and function are shaped by its environment with major shifts induced by the intensified anthropogenic pressures over the past centuries. This time interval extends beyond experimental and longitudinal studies typically designed to investigate microbiome change. The extensive collection of historical samples available in museums and herbaria worldwide is an untapped resource for studying host-microbiome interactions over a prolonged time and in a global scale. Currently, their potential remains unfulfilled owing to incompatibilities with analytical pipelines and limited understanding of optimal classification parameters. Host DNA removal was deemed necessary for accurate taxonomic assignment of metagenomic reads, however, for many host species in historical samples it is impractical due to the absence of reference genomes. Here, we demonstrated that host DNA content has no significant impact on key microbial ecological metrics such as alpha- and beta-diversity. In addition, sequencing reads from historical samples are often highly fragmented due to degradation processes. Through k-mer analysis of genomics sequences from host species and their associated microbiomes, we observed that the shortest length of metagenomics read that can produce meaningful results for taxonomic profiling in historical samples is 21 bp. Overall, this study establishes a solid foundation for integrating extensive natural history collections into host- associated microbiome research, offering important insights into the anthropogenic impacts on microbiomes."
"BackgroundIn Leishmania-endemic areas, humans are chronically exposed to the bites of vector sand flies, whose immunogenic salivary proteins modulate host immunity. The immune consequences of this chronic antigenic exposure remain poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo characterize bite-induced rash and cytokine responses to sand fly salivary proteins in humans chronically exposed to Lutzomyia longipalpis, the main vector of visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas.

MethodsWe conducted a controlled human vector challenge study, exposing 15 healthy volunteers to Lutzomyia longipalpis bites multiple times over a year. We assessed bite site skin reactions and stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with salivary gland extract or two immunogenic Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary proteins, LJM19 and LJL143, to measure cytokine responses and macrophage killing of Leishmania.

ResultsBite sites developed pruritic, erythematous papules consistent with a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response. PBMCs stimulated with LJM19 or LJL143 elicited TH1-polarized cytokine responses and high expression of the TH2 cytokine IL-13. LJM19 increased levels of IL-6 and IL-7, while both proteins stimulated IL-1{beta} and IFN- production. LJM19- and LJL143-mediated parasite killing by macrophages correlated with TH1 polarization. LJM19 also enhanced Leishmania killing in cells from individuals unexposed to Lutzomyia longipalpis. Two participants exhibited prominent bite site infiltration with CD4-CD8-T cells.

ConclusionsChronic exposure to sand fly bites elicits a DTH response and induces innate and adaptive cytokine responses to salivary proteins that correlate with enhanced Leishmania killing. Controlled human vector challenge studies are valuable for investigating the immunologic mechanisms driven by long-term exposure to vector salivary antigens.

"High honey bee colony mortality worldwide has underscored the critical role of queen bee health in colony survival, with poor queen quality frequently linked to colony losses. The gut microbiome plays fundamental roles in immunity, nutrition, and reproduction, making its characterization essential for understanding stressors that impact queen health, longevity, and fecundity, yet its role in mediating stress responses remains poorly understood. Here, we present a novel, non-invasive method for collecting feces from queen honey bees and demonstrate its potential as a powerful tool for profiling the gut microbiome, detecting stressor exposure, and screening for viral infections. This approach permits repeated, longitudinal assessments of individual queens, providing unprecedented insights into how environmental and pathogenic pressures influence queen health, longevity, and reproductive capacity. Beyond research applications, benefits include evaluating queens before colony introduction and mitigating disease transmission risks in international trade, where pathogen spread remains a major regulatory challenge."
"Alphaviruses are mosquito-borne RNA viruses that pose a significant public health threat, with no FDA-approved antiviral therapeutics available. The non-structural protein 2 helicase (nsP2hel) is an enzyme involved in unwinding dsRNA essential for alphavirus replication. This study reports the discovery and optimization of first-in-class oxaspiropiperidine inhibitors targeting nsP2hel. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies identified potent cyclic sulfonamide analogs with nanomolar antiviral activity against chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Biochemical analyses of nsP2hel ATPase and RNA unwindase activities showed these compounds act by a non-competitive mode suggesting that they are allosteric inhibitors. Viral resistance mutations mapped to nsP2hel and a fluorine-labeled analog exhibited direct binding to the protein by 19F NMR. The lead inhibitor, 2o, demonstrated broad-spectrum antialphaviral activity, reducing titers of CHIKV, Mayaro virus (MAYV), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). These findings support nsP2hel as a viable target for development of broad-spectrum direct-acting antialphaviral drugs.

"Visuomotor experience is necessary for the development of normal function of visual cortex (Attinger et al., 2017) and likely establishes a balance between movement-related predictions and sensory signals (Jordan and Keller, 2020). This process depends at least in part on plasticity in visual cortex (Widmer et al., 2022). Key signals involved in driving this plasticity are visuomotor prediction errors (Keller et al., 2012; Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018). Ideally however, the amount of plasticity induced by an error signal should be a function of several variables - including overall cortical prediction error, the animals experience in the current environment or task, stability of the current environment, and task engagement - for optimal computational performance. Candidates for regulators of visuomotor prediction error driven plasticity are the three major neuromodulatory systems that innervate visual cortex in the mouse: acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and serotonin. While visuomotor mismatch acutely triggers activity in noradrenaline (Jordan and Keller, 2023) but not acetylcholine (Yogesh and Keller, 2023) axons in visual cortex, how serotonergic axons in cortex respond to visuomotor mismatch is unknown. The serotonergic system in particular, is an interesting candidate for regulating visuomotor plasticity, as its activity is correlated with action-outcome uncertainty in mice (Grossman et al., 2020), and is increased under conditions of higher visuomotor gain in larval zebra fish (Kawashima et al., 2016). Here, we characterized the activity of serotonergic axons in visual cortex (V1) and in area A24b, a motor cortical area in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), of awake head-fixed mice using two-photon calcium imaging. Our results reveal cortical region-specific responses to visuomotor stimuli in serotonergic axons, but no evidence of a response to visuomotor mismatch. However, average activity in serotonergic axons was increased under conditions of greater visuomotor uncertainty. Thus, serotonin could function to regulate visuomotor plasticity as a function of the predictability of the environment on longer time scales."
"The cerebellum is thought to fine-tune movement without being required for its production. However, this textbook view derives mainly from studies of mammalian species with highly developed cerebral cortices. Here we examined cerebellar function in the elephant-nose fish, a member of a family of African weakly electric fish (Mormyridae) in which the cerebellum is massively enlarged. The elephant-nose fish is named for a flexible facial appendage that is used to probe surfaces and extract prey from substrate. Results from microstimulation, electrophysiological recordings, and lesions support a direct role for the C1 region of the mormyrid cerebellum in controlling movement of this appendage. These findings suggest that the cerebellum is capable of performing functions typically ascribed to the cerebral cortex, emphasizing the importance of evolutionary history on the functional specialization of brain regions."
"In patients with ischaemic stroke, retrograde perfusion of the penumbra by the leptomeningeal collateral vessels (LMCs) is a strong predictor of clinical outcome, thus raising the possibility that enhancing LMC flow could offer a novel therapeutic approach. Here, using computational modelling we show that LMCs experience elevated fluid shear stress that is significantly higher than that in other blood vessels during ischaemic stroke in animals and humans. We take advantage of this to selectively enhance flow in LMCs using shear-activated nanoparticle aggregates carrying the vasodilator nitroglycerin (NG-NPAs) that specifically release drug in regions of vessels with high shear stress ([&ge;]100 dyne/cm2). The NG-NPAs significantly increased LMC-mediated penumbral perfusion, decreased infarct volume, and reduced neurological deficit without altering systemic blood pressure in a rat ischaemic stroke model. The NG-NPAs also did not cause known common side effects of systemic nitrate administration, such as systemic hypotension, cerebral vascular steal, cortical vein dilation, or intracranial pressure elevation. Systemic administration of free NG at the maximal tolerated dose, which was ten times higher than the dose of NG used in the NG-NPAs, did not enhance LMC perfusion and dropped blood pressure. Thus, packaging NG within shear-activated NPAs can potentially enable this widely available vasodilator to become a highly effective therapeutic for ischaemic stroke."
"Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (pDST) remains the gold standard for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex drug resistance determination. Next generation sequencing technologies can identify heteroresistant populations at low frequencies, but little is known about the impact of heteroresistance on bedaquiline (BDQ) pDST results. We simulated heteroresistance using in vitro generated MmpR5 mutants mixed with the progenitor strain at various percentages (1-20%) and did pDST using MGIT960 culture (1 and 2 {micro}g/mL BDQ concentrations). Targeted Next Generation Sequencing (tNGS) was used to quantify the mutant sub-population in growth control tubes, which were expected to maintain the mutant: wild type proportion throughout the assay. Growth units of these growth control tubes were also comparable with minor differences in time-to-positivity between ratio mixtures. Only when intermediate results were considered could BDQ heteroresistance be detected at frequencies of approximately 1% by pDST at a critical concentration of 1 {micro}g/mL using BACTEC MGIT960 coupled with EpiCenter TBeXiST software. The ability of pDST, a widely available DST technique, to reveal the presence of BDQ-resistant subpopulations at the phenotypic testing stage could improve resistance determination and potentially reduce time to effective treatment.

ImportanceMultidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is estimated to cause up to 19% of all antimicrobial resistance-attributable deaths worldwide. Further, the success rate for the treatment of drug-resistant TB, in the presence of adherence, is poor at only 68%. The advent of bedaquiline (BDQ) has revolutionized MDR-TB care, but BDQ resistance determination is hampered by several obstacles facing both phenotypic and genotypic testing. Specifically for phenotypic susceptibility testing, BDQ-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with variants in MmpR5, which may display minimal inhibitory concentration values just below the critical concentration or are present at low frequencies (heteroresistance; the presence of mixed mutant and wild-type populations within a specimen), are typically designated as susceptible. This may lead to prescription of an ineffective regimen and amplification of resistance. The BACTEC MGIT960 platform coupled with EpiCenter TBeXiST software for phenotypic testing, which is currently the only routinely used method of BDQ DST, can be used to derive more information about underlying resistant populations. We demonstrate how this is possible through the consideration of intermediate results (i.e., when growth units in a drug-containing tube reach the threshold for resistance but only after a further week of incubation). These intermediate results, commonly disregarded by TB laboratories, could lead to earlier detection of BDQ resistance. This is especially crucial when the genetic mechanism of resistance is unknown, a variant has not been associated with resistance in the interim, and in cases of heteroresistance."
"Reflection Interference Contrast Microscopy (RICM, also known as interference reflection microscopy) and related techniques have become of wide interest to the biophysical, soft matter and biochemistry communities owing to their exquisite sensitivity for characterising thin films or individual nanoscopic objects adsorbed onto surfaces, or for monitoring cell-substrate interactions. Over the recent years, striking progresses have been made to improve the sensitivity and the quantitative analysis of RICM. Its use in more complex environments, with spurious reflections stemming from a variety of structures in the sample, remains however challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate two optical sectioning methods that effectively reduce such background and can be readily implemented in a conventional RICM setup: line confocal detection, and structured illumination microscopy. We characterise experimentally the benefits to image quality and demonstrate the use of the methods for quantitative imaging of complex biological and biomimetic samples: cellular membranes, thin organic films, surface biofunctionalization. We then discuss the benefits of each method and provide guidelines to arbitrate between sectioning and signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we provide a detailed description of our experimental setup and a home-written image acquisition and processing software that should allow the interested reader to duplicate such a setup on a home-built or commercial microscope."
"BackgroundBenzene is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant generated by a variety of natural and anthropological sources. It is a known carcinogen and hematopoietic toxin; however, little is known about benzenes potential atherogenicity.

HypothesisInhaled benzene induces atherogenesis by increasing vascular inflammation in LDL receptor Knockout (LDLR-KO) mice.

MethodsMale LDLR-KO mice were exposed to HEPA-filtered air or benzene (1 ppm, 6h/day, 5days/week) for 24 weeks. For the last 12 weeks of exposure, the mice were maintained on a western diet. The single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) of aortae was performed at Novogene. For in vitro experiments, splenic naive T cells were exposed to 1 {micro}M of hydroquinone (HQ) for 24 hours, and intracellular ROR-gamma levels were measured by flow cytometry.

ResultsBenzene inhalation increased the aortic valve lesion area by more than 25% (P<0.05) in LDLR-KO mice. Using snRNAseq, eleven major cell types were detected, including T cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Benzene increased the number of T cells by 2.5-fold, proliferating T-cells by 5.8-fold, and VSMC by 1.6-fold, suggesting increased cellularity and reduced plaque stability. In addition, benzene upregulated Th17 polarization marker Rorc and negative regulators of apoptosis Rag1 and Bcl11b while significantly attenuating the expression of proliferation inhibitor Ms4a4b in T cells. In VSMC, benzene downregulated extracellular matrix organization genes and upregulated platelet degranulation pathways. Polarization of T cells into Th17 was confirmed by HQ-dependent upregulation of ROR-gamma in vitro.

ConclusionOur data suggest that inhaled benzene exposure compromises plaque cellularity and stability by facilitating T-cell proliferation and polarization, which coincides with the degradation of smooth muscle extracellular matrix and platelet activation."
"Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a phenomenon resulting from mitochondrial-nuclear incompatibility that is widely used in hybrid breeding. Although the mitochondrial gene orf137 has been identified as the causal CMS gene in tomatoes, its function remains unclear. In this study, we characterized the male-sterile phenotypes and analyzed the CMS pollen transcriptome. Microscopic and calcium imaging analyses revealed that CMS pollen exhibited abnormal germination from multiple apertures, accompanied by elevated calcium concentrations and vesicle accumulation, which are typically observed in pollen tube tips. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 440 differentially expressed genes, including four pectin methylesterase inhibitor (PMEI) genes that were highly expressed in the pollen. PME activity was significantly reduced in CMS pollen, suggesting its association with abnormal pollen germination. ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which are key mediators of mitochondrial retrograde signaling (MRS), remained unchanged in CMS pollen, and the expression of the mitochondrial stress marker AOX1a was not elevated. These findings suggest that orf137 triggers an alternative MRS pathway independent of ATP or ROS, potentially leading to PMEI upregulation and abnormal pollen germination. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of CMS-induced male sterility in tomatoes involving nuclear gene regulation through unconventional mitochondrial signaling."
"Axonemal dyneins power ciliary motility and phosphorylation of key intermediate and light chain components affects the regulation and properties of these motors in very distantly related organisms. It is also known that many axonemal dynein heavy chains are subject to this post-translational modification although this has been little studied. Here we examine axonemal dynein heavy chains from a broad range of ciliated eukaryotes and identify phosphorylated sites embedded within various kinase recognition motifs such as those for PKA, PKC and casein kinase II. Mapping these sites onto discrete heavy chain types reveals class-specific locations apparently mediated by different kinases. For example, we find that all Chlamydomonas  heavy chain phosphorylation sites are in an extended loop derived from AAA5 that arches over the coiled-coil buttress which in turn interacts with the microtubule-binding stalk. In contrast, most sites in the monomeric inner arm dyneins occur very close to the N-terminus and may be involved in assembly processes. In Chlamydomonas, the two cilia (termed cis and trans) exhibit different intrinsic beat frequencies and we identify cilium-specific phosphorylation patterns on both the  heavy chain and outer arm docking complex consistent with differential regulation of these motors in the two organelles.

SignificanceO_LIMany axonemal dynein heavy chains are extensively phosphorylated. However, the location, sequence context and potential role of these modifications is uncertain.
C_LIO_LIHere we use mass spectrometry to define phosphorylated sites in inner and outer arm dyneins from a broad range of motile ciliated eukaryotes.
C_LIO_LIWe identify numerous modified sites that correspond to various kinase consensus sequences and reveal that multiple sites occur in conserved locations depending on dynein heavy chain class. We also find phosphorylation modifications that are specific to either the cis or trans cilium of Chlamydomonas which may be related to their inherent beat frequency imbalance.

"The general stress response (GSR) protects bacteria from a wide range of stressors. In Alphaproteobacteria, GSR activation is coordinated by HWE/HisKA2 family histidine kinases (HKs), which can exhibit non-canonical structure and function. For example, while most light-oxygen-voltage sensor-containing HKs are light activated dimers, the Rubellimicrobium thermophilum RT-HK has inverted ""dark on, light off"" signaling logic with a tunable monomer/dimer equilibrium. Here, we further investigate these atypical behaviors of RT-HK and characterize its downstream signaling network. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we find that RT-HK uses a signal transduction mechanism similar to light-activated systems, despite its inverted logic. Mutagenesis reveals that RT-HK autophosphorylates in trans, with changes to the J helix linking sensor and kinase domains affecting autophosphorylation levels. Exploring downstream effects of RT-HK, we identified two GSR genetic regions, each encoding a copy of the central regulator PhyR. In vitro measurements of phosphotransfer from RT-HK to the two putative PhyRs revealed that RT-HK signals only to one, and does so at an increased intensity in the dark, consistent with its reversed logic. X-ray crystal structures of both PhyRs revealed a substantial shift within the receiver domain of one, suggesting a basis for RT-HK specificity. We probed further down the pathway using nuclear magnetic resonance to determine that the single NepR homolog interacts with both unphosphorylated PhyRs, and this interaction is decoupled from activation in one PhyR. This work expands our understanding of HWE/HisKA2 family signal transduction, revealing marked variations from signaling mechanisms previously identified in other GSR networks."
"Rab4 GTPase, essential for endosomal sorting and trafficking, is implicated in synaptic atrophy and dementia. To uncover the underlying mechanism, we studied the correlation between Rab4 vesicle transport in axons and episodic remodeling of synapses in the central nervous system (CNS) of Drosophila larvae. We found that synapse-bound traffic and presynaptic enrichment of Rab4 vesicles increase during the programmed, transient contraction of synapses in the ventral neuropil region at a specific larval stage. This coincides with the episodic activation of insulin and Vps34-mediated signaling, which elevates phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate levels on Rab4 vesicles. The presence of this phospholipid on Rab4-associated vesicles recruit a PX-domain-containing motor protein, Klp98A, accelerating synapse-directed traffic. This, in turn, increases presynaptic enrichment of Rab4 during the developmentally programmed synapse contraction phase. Our findings elucidate the molecular mechanism that regulates developmental synaptic plasticity in the CNS via insulin signaling and directed axonal transport of endosomes.

Author summaryHealthy brain function relies on the growth and remodeling of synaptic connections between nerve cells. This process involves carefully orchestrated movements of proteins and membranes inside the neurites. For instance, endosome movement in the nerve cell extensions helps guide neuronal growth, recycle parts of the synapse, and alter signal transmissions between neurons. Rab GTPases, a group of small G-proteins, are crucial for these processes. Here, we aimed to understand what triggers these processes and how the supply chain within nerve cell extensions is connected to changes at the synapse. In fruit fly larvae, we observed that the movement of Rab4 vesicles in the nerve cell extensions is inversely related to gross synapse content. A further examination revealed that onset of insulin signaling accelerates the Rab4 vesicles towards synapse through a lipid kinase called Vps34, which makes a signaling lipid called phospatidylinnositol-3-phosphate. Higher levels this lipid molecule on Rab4 vesicles attract a motor protein, Klp98A, speeding up their movement during the synaptic contraction phase. Our findings reveal a new mechanism that regulates Rab4 vesicle transport and its impact on synapse stability. The study further suggests potential targets for controlling age-related dementia likely to be caused by excessive insulin signaling in neurons."
"ObjectiveTraumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to secondary injury, including axon and myelin damage, which contributes to long-term neurological deficits. The PET tracer [18F]3F4AP, a fluorinated derivative of the FDA-approved drug 4-aminopyridine, selectively binds to voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels, offering a novel approach to assess TBI-related node of Ranvier disruption and demyelination. This study evaluates [18F]3F4AP PET in penetrating and non-penetrating TBI models.

MethodsEither controlled cortical impact (CCI, penetrating) or concussive (non-penetrating) TBI models were used to induce TBI in mice. Dynamic PET imaging with [18F]3F4AP was performed at time points of 0, 3, 7, 14, and/or 31 days post-injury (dpi), with quantitative analyses comparing tracer uptake in injured versus control regions. Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining was conducted to evaluate histological myelin loss.

ResultsIn the CCI model, [18F]3F4AP PET imaging demonstrated a 34% increase in tracer uptake at the injury site at 7 dpi, correlating with histological evidence of demyelination. Tracer uptake gradually declined over time, reflecting potential remyelination. The concussive TBI model showed a smaller and more diffuse increase in uptake at 7 dpi compared to CCI.

Conclusion[18F]3F4AP PET imaging effectively detects demyelination following TBI, with very high sensitivity in penetrating injuries. These findings highlight the potential of [18F]3F4AP as a valuable imaging biomarker for assessing TBI progression and/or therapeutic response. Further studies are warranted to explore its clinical applicability and comparison with other imaging modalities."
"2Cyanobacteria are key contributors to biogeochemical cycles through photosynthesis and carbon fixation. In filamentous, multicellular cyanobacteria these functions can be influenced through gliding motility, which enables filaments to localise in response to light and also form aggregates. Here, we use the aggregate forming species Fluctiforma draycotensis to study gliding motility dynamics in detail. We find that filaments move in curved and straight trajectories interspersed with re-orientation or reversal of direction. Most reversals take few seconds but some take substantially longer, resulting in a long-tailed distribution of stoppage times. Mean filament speeds range around a micron per second with a relatively uniform distribution against filament length, implying that all or fixed proportion of cells in a filament contribute to movement. We implement a biophysical model that can recapitulate these findings. Model simulations show that for filaments to reverse quickly, cells in a filament must achieve high coordination of the direction of the forces that they generate. To seek experimental support of this prediction, we track individual cells in a filament. This reveals that cells translational movement is fully coupled with their rotation along the long-axis of the filament, and that cellular movement remains coordinated throughout a reversal. For some filaments, especially longer ones, however, we also find that cellular coordination can be lost, and filaments can form buckles that can twist around themselves, resulting in plectonemes. The experimental findings and the biophysical model presented here will inform future studies of individual and collective filament movement.

1 Significance StatementCyanobacteria contribute to global oxygen production and carbon capture. Some cyanobacteria exist as multicellular filaments and display gliding motility that allows them to respond to light and to form aggregates, which influences their biological functions. Here, we study the dynamics of gliding motility. We find that filaments movement is interspersed with re-orientation or reversal of direction and that mean filament speed is mostly independent of filament length. We implement a biophysical model that predicts these features to relate to cells in a filament having high coordination of the direction of the forces that they generate. We find experimental support for this predicted cellular coordination, but also discover instances of longer filaments loosing coordination, resulting in buckling and entangling with other filaments."
"A hallmark feature of neurodevelopmental ciliopathies is the hypo-dysplasia of the cerebellar vermis, as observed among most Joubert Syndrome patients. Despite significant advances in mouse models, the pathogenetic mechanisms linking ciliary gene dysfunction to Joubert syndrome neurodevelopmental defects are still poorly understood. In this study, we generated cerebellar organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells carrying null mutations or patient-derived variants in the Joubert syndrome causal gene RPGRIP1L, which encodes a scaffold protein crucial for cilia function. Using immunolabelling and transcriptomics, we show that WT organoids recapitulate early steps of cerebellar development, including the expression of markers for both Granule and Purkinje cell lineages. In contrast, cerebellar organoids derived from all RPGRIP1L-deficient lines exhibit a common severe reduction of Purkinje lineage markers, along with decreased neurogenesis. The neurogenesis defect is coupled to increased progenitor proliferation, as well as extended overactivation of the FGF pathway. Restoring normal levels of FGF signaling in RPGRIP1L-deficient organoids rescues the proliferative/neurogenic balance as well as Purkinje lineage formation. Thus, our results uncover an early FGF deregulation that hampers correct neuronal differentiation and could participate in the cerebellar phenotype of patients suffering from neurodevelopmental ciliopathies."
"In animals and plants, egg production is essential for fertility, reproduction, and embryonic development. The production of functional eggs in sufficient numbers for a female lifespan requires dynamic and precisely coordinated cellular and developmental programs in early oogenesis. However, our understanding of their underlying regulatory mechanisms is critically lacking. Here, we aimed to identify overlooked essential regulators of early oogenesis in zebrafish. First, we present the establishment of a long-term ovary culture system which enables physiological oocyte development from oogonia to primordial follicles in cultured ovaries, providing an invaluable ex-vivo platform for rapid investigation. Next, we utilized this system for robust functional screening of candidates from stage-specific oocyte transcriptomic data. We identified mTOR, Stat3, and Stathmin as novel regulators of oocyte polarity. By using a combination of genetics, pharmacological manipulations ex-vivo, and rescue experiments, we established an essential mTOR-Stat3-Stathmin pathway that orchestrates centrosome regulation and microtubule organization to facilitate oocyte polarity. Microtubules control the localization and condensation of the essential polarity regulator Bucky ball (Buc). Loss of mTOR or Stat3 functions, as well as overactivation of Stathmin (a microtubule destabilizing protein) resulted in aberrant centrosome regulation and destabilization of microtubules, leading to dispersed mis-localized Buc condensates and loss of polarity. We show that mTOR acts upstream of Stat3 in oocytes, and that inhibition of Stathmin in stat3-/-or mTOR deficient ovaries rescued both cytoskeletal and polarity defects. We propose a novel mTOR-Stat3-Stathmin pathway which through cytoskeletal regulation, provides oocytes with polarization competence, a step likely widely conserved in biology. mTOR, Stat3, and Stathmin are known for their roles in cellular growth and cancer. Our work reveals their novel unpredicted functions in cell polarity during animal post-embryonic development."
"Previous work has demonstrated that visual working memory of peripherally presented patterns transitions from location-specific to spatially generalized representations. It remains unclear what the temporal dynamics are of this generalization, and to which processing stages it is linked. Here we investigated the neural correlates of peripherally encoded memoranda before and after an item was selected for response, focusing on when the representation changes from a location-specific to a spatially generalized code. Thirty healthy participants memorized two orientations presented serially at 15 degrees eccentricity to the left and right of central fixation. One of the two items was subsequently cued, for which memory performance was then assessed. During the delays between each of these events, impulse signals were presented to trace memoranda in potentially activity-silent or activity-reduced states. Replicating prior findings, we observed that neural codes transitioned from dynamic, location-specific states to spatially and temporally generalized stable states post-encoding, here emerging from about 400 ms onwards. Importantly, this already occurred during maintenance, prior to selection of the response-relevant item. After the cue, first the location, and then the identity of the cued item emerged in the signal, suggesting that, despite the by then generalized code, location remained a useful basis for selection. The results suggest that spatial generalization is predominantly a maintenance-related rather than a selection-related process."
"ADP-ribosylation is a chemically versatile modification of proteins, RNA and DNA that regulates various important signaling pathways, many of which are implicated in human diseases. Despite being discovered 60 years ago in the form of poly-ADP-ribosylation - the most studied form of this modification - investigating ADP-ribosylation at the molecular level has historically been challenging. By applying serine ADP-ribosylation-based antibody engineering technology, we have developed the first site-specific, as well as sensitive, mono-ADP-ribosylation modular antibodies. Here, we extend the scope of this technology to poly-ADP-ribosylation. By combining serine poly-ADP-ribosylated peptides as antigens, PARP1 serine mono- and poly-ADP-ribosylation for validation, phage display and the SpyTag protein ligation systems, we developed modular antibodies that are highly specific for poly-ADP-ribosylation. SpyTag-based coupling of horseradish peroxidase at specific positions, distant from the antigen-binding region of the antibody, yields a format that simplifies immunoblotting while dramatically enhancing poly-ADP-ribosylation detection sensitivity. Additionally, the creation of synthetic immunoglobulin formats - mouse, rabbit and human - enables straightforward co-detection of mono- and poly-ADP-ribosylation in cells by immunofluorescence. Our new tools improve and simplify the detection of poly-ADP-ribosylation, particularly in immunoblotting, enabling specific investigations of this key cellular signal in the context of other distinct forms of ADP-ribosylation."
"Engineering protein stability is a critical challenge in biotechnology. Here, we used massively parallel deep mutational scanning (DMS) to comprehensively explore the mutational stability landscape of human myoglobin (hMb) and identify key mutations that enhance stability. Our DMS approach involved screening over 10,000 hMb variants by yeast surface display, single-cell sorting and high-throughput DNA sequencing. We show how surface display levels serve as a proxy for thermostability of soluble hMb variants, and report strong correlations between DMS-derived display levels and top-performing machine learning stability prediction algorithms. This approach led to the discovery of a variant with a de novo disulfide bond between residues R32C and C111, which increased thermostability by >12 {degrees}C compared to wild-type hMb. By combining single stabilizing mutations with R32C, we engineered combinatorial variants that exhibited predominantly additive effects on stability with minimal epistasis. The most stable combinatorial variant exhibited a denaturation temperature exceeding 89 {degrees}C, representing a >17 {degrees}C improvement over wild-type hMb. Our findings demonstrate the capabilities in DMS-assisted combinatorial protein engineering to guide the discovery of thermostable variants, and highlight the potential of massively parallel mutational analysis for the development of proteins for industrial and biomedical applications."
"While investigating foodstuffs for ESBL-producing Aeromonas species on ampicillin dextrin agar with vancomycin and cefotaxime, a multidrug-resistant Empedobacter brevis strain GBW-1 was identified from ground beef. Phylogenetic analysis supports the interconnectedness of environment, humans and food driving this species evolutionary development. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated resistance to gentamicin, carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins. Whole genome sequencing of this strain detected a 3.74 Mb genome with 32.8% GC content containing 3,780 coding genes. Among these genes, at least three known antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes were identified with qacG, vanT gene within the vanG cluster, and a novel variant of the metallo-{beta}-lactamase blaEBR-6. This novel homologue, EBR-6, was compared against previously known EBR variants and was found to be closest to EBR-3 with an 84.98% amino acid identity match. Docking software predicted these mutations vary the binding to meropenem. Furthermore, nearly 100 annotated regions associated with mobile genetic elements, including the presence of three, separate tra operons were identified on the genome. Together, these findings implicate the importance of horizontal gene transfer in the acquisition of AMR among the emerging pathogen Empedobacter brevis and further stress its One Health nature.

ImportanceAs global trade and commerce continues to create a more interconnected world, the increasing frequency and spread of antimicrobial resistance amongst foodborne bacteria poses a significant challenge to public health. Here, we report the isolation of the multi-drug resistant Empedobacter brevis GBW-1, a bacterial strain harboring resistance against meropenem, third-generation cephalosporins, and gentamicin. Of particular note, this strain displays a novel variant of a metallo-{beta}-lactamase (MBL) gene, blaEBR-6, as well as three distinct tra operons, suggesting enhanced capacity of horizontal gene transfer. These findings highlight how foodborne bacteria may serve as reservoirs and vectors for the further spread of resistance genes, reinforcing the necessity of utilizing a collaborative One Health approach to combat AMR across sectors."
"P2X7 receptors are important drug targets involved in pathologies ranging from psychiatric disorders to cancer. Being membrane embedded receptors, they are challenging for structural characterisation and at present we only have a small number of X-ray and cryoEM structures for P2X7 bound to antagonists. We demonstrate that Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) NMR on live mammalian cells (on-cell STD NMR) overexpressing P2X7 receptors allows further structural insight on the complexes of P2X7 with two potent negative allosteric modulators, namely AZ10606120 and JNJ-47465567, via the determination of the binding epitope mapping of the interactions e.g. the main region of contact between the ligand and the binding pocket. This approach, reported for the first time on membrane-embedded ion channels, in combination with molecular docking, allows us to propose the first NMR-validated 3D molecular models for two antagonists as bound to human P2X7 receptors, and to correlate the structural knowledge acquired with the pharmacology data. We highlight the transformative potential of this application to aid drug design efforts in a less resource-demanding fashion than X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM and we envisage on-cell STD NMR to fast become an asset for structure-activity-relationship studies helping knowledge-based development of efficient drugs targeting P2X7 and other ion channels/membrane-embedded proteins."
"O_LIA vital crop for sub-Saharan Africa, cowpea productivity is threatened by climate change, including increased heatwave intensity, duration, and frequency. Rubisco activase (Rca) is a key molecular chaperone that maintains Rubisco activity and due to its thermal sensitivity is a key target for improving crop climate resilience.
C_LIO_LIWe identified and characterised four Rca isoforms in Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. cv. IT97K-499-35 in vitro: Rca1{beta}, Rca8, Rca10 and Rca10{beta}. Cowpea leaf and plant growth traits were also investigated during a 5-day +10 {degrees}C heatwave that included assessment of Rubisco and Rca activity in leaf extracts, and relative changes in the abundance of the four Rca isoforms.
C_LIO_LICowpea Rca10 and Rca10{beta} had higher thermal maxima, broader thermal optima and higher rates of ATP hydrolysis and Rubisco reactivation in vitro. In the absence of water deficit, the heatwave caused only mild effects, including increases in leaf temperature and expression of Rca10, small decreases in Rubisco activity and activation state, and unaltered temperature response of Rubisco activation by Rca.
C_LIO_LIThe superior Rca10 and Rca10{beta} isoforms offer the prospect of enhancing the thermotolerance of cowpea and other crops in anticipation of more extreme future heatwaves.

"Coordinated cell rotation along a curved matrix interface can sculpt epithelial tissues into spherical morphologies. Subsequently, radially-oriented invasion of multicellular strands or branches can occur by local remodeling of the confining matrix. These symmetry-breaking transitions emerge from the dynamic reciprocity between cells and matrix, but remain poorly understood. Here, we show that epithelial cell spheroids collectively transition from circumferential orbiting to radial invasion via bi-directional interactions with the surrounding matrix curvature. Initially, spheroids exhibit an ellipsoidal shape but become rounded as orbiting occurs. However, cells gradually reorient from coordinated rotation towards outward strand invasion due to the accumulation of contractile tractions at discrete sites. Remarkably, the initial ellipsoid morphology predicts subsequent invasion of 2-4 strands roughly aligned with the major axis. We then perturb collective migration using osmotic pressure, showing that orbiting can be arrested and invasion can be reversed. We also investigate coordinated orbiting in ""mosaic"" spheroids, showing a small fraction of ""leader"" cells with weakened cell-cell adhesions can impede collective orbiting but still invade into the matrix. Finally, we establish a minimal self-propelled particle model to elucidate how collective orbiting is mediated by the crosstalk of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion along a curved boundary. Altogether, this work elucidates how tissue morphogenesis is governed by the interplay of collective behaviors and the local curvature of the cell-matrix, with relevance for embryonic development and tumor progression."
"The ability to accurately encode and represent genetic sequences in machine learning process is critical for advancements in biotechnology, specifically in genetic engineering and synthetic biology. Traditional sequence encoding method face significant limitations in handling sequence variability, maintaining reading frame integrity, and preserving biologically relevant features. This preliminary study presents TIPs-VF (Translator-Interpreter Pre-seeding for Variable-length Fragments), a simple and efficient encoding framework designed to address some of the key challenges in representing genetic sequences for machine learning. The results showed that TIPs- VF enables a variable-length sequence representation that retains biological context while ensuring the alignment of encodings with codon boundary, making it particularly suited for modular genetic construction. TIPs-VF demonstrated superior performance in truncation and fragmentation analysis, sequence homology detection, domain assessment, and splice junction identification. Unlike conventional methods that require fixed-length inputs, TIPs-VF dynamically adapts to sequence length variations, preserving essential features such as domain similarities and sequence motifs. Additionally, TIPs-VF improves open reading frame recognition and enhances the identification of vector parts and plasmid elements by unifying sequence embeddings with the three possible open reading frame. Overall, TIPs-VF offers a robust, biologically meaningful encoding framework that overcomes the constraints of traditional sequence representations by incorporating sequence, length, and positional awareness. The TIPs-VF encoding infrastructure is available at https://tips.logiacommunications.com."
"Early-stage Alzheimers pathology correlates with disrupted neuronal excitability, which can drive network and cognitive dysfunction even prior to neurodegeneration. However, the emergence and extent of these changes may vary by brain region and cell types situated in those regions. Here we aimed to investigate the effects of AD pathology on different neuron subtypes in both the entorhinal cortex, a region with enhanced pathology in early AD, and the primary visual cortex, a relatively unaffected region in early-stage AD. We designed and employed a semi-automated patch clamp electrophysiology apparatus to record from fast-spiking parvalbumin interneurons and excitatory neurons in these regions, recording from over 150 cells in young adult APP-KI mice. In entorhinal cortex, amyloid overproduction resulted in PV interneuron hypoexcitability, whereas excitatory neurons were concurrently hyperexcitable. Conversely, neurons of either subclass were largely unaffected in the visual cortex. Together, these findings suggest that fast-spiking parvalbumin interneurons in the entorhinal cortex, but not in the visual cortex, play an integral role in AD progression."
"We created CandyCollect, a lollipop-inspired, child-friendly saliva sampling device that provides enhanced comfort compared to common throat and mouth swabs. The device has an open microchannel and a functionalized surface that effectively captures and stores the saliva and pathogens. We recently demonstrated the ability to combine the CandyCollect with rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) for fast and accessible detection of group A streptococcus (GAS).

However, the current procedure necessitates manual steps to elute and transfer captured antigens from the lollipop to RADTs, which relies on the user to follow complex instructions, increasing the likelihood of error. In this work, we developed the CandyCollect Open to Closed (O2C) microfluidic system to automate antigen elution and streamline detection with RADTs. The O2C system securely seals the open microchannels of the CandyCollect device to create a continuous closed channel for seamless delivery of elution reagents to release antigens at the press of a button for subsequent lateral flow detection. Our system leverages and combines the unique benefits of both open channel and closed channel microfluidics into one platform, further enhancing the potential of both methods. We performed experiments with GAS bacteria spiked into saliva and compared the manual and O2C elution methods. Both the manual and O2C methods showed clear test lines on the RADT strips at clinically relevant GAS concentrations (between 5 x105 and 109 CFU/mL). The O2C provided comparable or better results than the manual procedure in a more convenient form factor. The O2C platform has the potential to enable user-friendly screening for respiratory pathogens by minimally trained users in decentralized settings."
"Despite recent approval of monoclonal antibodies that reduce amyloid (A{beta}) accumulation, the development of disease-modifying strategies targeting the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimers disease (AD) is urgently needed. We demonstrate that mitochondrial complex I (mtCI) represents a druggable target, where its weak inhibition activates neuroprotective signaling, benefiting AD mouse models with A{beta} and p-Tau pathologies. Rational design and structure-activity relationship studies yielded novel mtCI inhibitors profiled in a drug discovery funnel designed to address their safety, selectivity, and efficacy. The new lead compound C458 is highly protective against A{beta} toxicity, has favorable pharmacokinetics, and has minimal off-target effects. C458 exhibited excellent brain penetrance, activating neuroprotective pathways with a single dose. Preclinical studies in APP/PS1 mice were conducted via functional tests, metabolic assessment, in vivo 31P- NMR spectroscopy, blood cytokine panels, ex vivo electrophysiology, and Western blotting. Chronic oral administration improved long-term potentiation, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, antioxidant signaling, and cellular energetics. These studies provide further evidence that the restoration of mitochondrial function and brain energetics in response to mild energetic stress represents a promising disease- modifying strategy for AD."
"Caloric restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention that delays the onset of age-related diseases and enhances survival in diverse organisms, and although changes in adipose tissues have been implicated in the beneficial effects of CR the molecular details are unknown. Here we show shared and depot-specific adaptations to life-long CR in subcutaneous and visceral adipose depots taken from advanced age male rhesus monkeys. Differential gene expression and pathway analysis identified key differences between the depots in metabolic, immune, and inflammatory pathways. In response to CR, RNA processing and proteostasis-related pathways were enriched in both depots but changes in metabolic, growth, and inflammatory pathways were depot-specific. Commonalities and differences that distinguish adipose depots are shared among monkeys and humans and the response to CR is highly conserved. These data reveal depot-specificity in adipose tissue adaptation that likely reflects differences in function and contribution to age-related disease vulnerability.

In BriefRhesus monkey adipose tissues are highly responsive to long-term caloric restriction, although the response is depot-specific. Shared features include proteostasis and RNA processing pathways, whereas metabolic pathways, alterations in processes influenced by growth signaling, and changes in exon usage were depot-specific. The impact of CR on subcutaneous adipose tissue is highly conserved between monkeys and humans.

HighlightsO_LIAt the transcript level, SAT and VAT taken from the same animals show modest specialization, primarily in metabolic and immune pathways.
C_LIO_LIThe transcriptome of SAT is more responsive to CR than that of VAT, with depot-specific differences in metabolic adaptation and cell type composition.
C_LIO_LIRNA processing pathways are engaged by CR and transcript isoforms are enriched in both depots, but differential exon usage is limited to SAT.
C_LIO_LIAdipose reprogramming is linked to CR induced differences in body composition and systemic indices of health.
C_LIO_LIThe impact of CR on subcutaneous adipose tissue is highly similar between monkeys and humans.

"Taste is a major driving force that influences food choices and dietary intake. Adiponectin has been shown to selectively enhance cellular responses to fatty acids by mediating the activation of AMPK and translocation of CD36 in taste cells via its receptor AdipoR1. Whether Adipor1 gene knockout affects fat taste responsiveness and dietary fat intake in animals remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated cellular, neural, and behavioral responses to fat, as well as the dietary fat intake in global Adipor1 knockout mice and their WT controls. Sex-specific changes in cellular and behavioral responses to fatty acid were observed in Adipor1 knockout mice. Linoleic acid (LA)-induced calcium responsiveness appears to be reduced in taste cells from Adipor1-deficient males and increased in taste cells from Adipor1-deficient females. Brief-access taste testing revealed a loss of fat taste behavioral responsiveness in naive Adipor1-/- animals. Fat taste loss found in Adipor1-/- males was restored after fat exposure and showed no significant differences in taste behavioral responses to fatty acids with WT controls in two-bottle preference and conditioned taste aversion tests. Adipor1-/- females were found to have diminished preference for LA in two-bottle preference tests, lower intralipid/water lick ratio in a brief-access assay, and reduced avoidance for LA in conditioned taste aversion assay. Furthermore, the taste nerve responses to intralipid and the dietary fat intakes appeared to be the same between Adipor1-/- and WT mice. In the high-fat diet feeding study, Adipor1-/- females gained more weight, while no differences in body weight gain were found in males. Together, we show that adiponectin/AdipoR1 signaling plays crucial sex-specific roles in the modulation of fat taste and the maintenance of healthy body weight primarily by regulating energy expenditure rather than dietary fat intake in mice."
"Crop yields in intercropping systems are the result of a combination of factors dominated by plastic responses in plant traits to the heterogeneity associated with the intercrop design and the row configuration of the intercrop. Disentangling their relative influence is infeasible in situ but crucial for cultivar selection and intercrop design. Using functional-structural plant (FSP) modelling, these effects can be separated in silico. Here, a mechanistic FSP model was developed, including three-dimensional aboveground plant architecture of maize and soybean, radiation distribution, and assimilate allocation. The model was used to explore the potential to improve yields in a simultaneous intercrop by disentangling the contribution of three plastic traits related to photosynthesis, leaf thickness and plant height. The improved phenotypes were then simulated in two intercrop configurations, single- and twin-rows of maize, for potential increases in land-use efficiency. The study revealed that for maize, photosynthesis had the greatest contribution (+78%), followed by plant height (+31%) and leaf thickness (+6%) where the total maize monoculture phenotype produced the greatest maize yield without affecting the yield of intercropped soybean. However, soybean trait plasticity had a negligible effect on soybean yield, but the soybean monoculture phenotype with a low light-saturated photosynthetic rate resulted in the greatest intercropped maize yield. These improved phenotypes may increase land-use efficiency by 1-3% relative to the standard monoculture systems of the Midwest, USA. Together, these results could aid the selection of maize and soybean germplasm that could improve the productivity of a simultaneous intercrop."
"Increasing evidence indicate that individual host immune response to pathogens may be as important as virulence factors in determining the severity of infection. However, most available data on pathogen-host interactions are based on in vitro findings, neglecting the genetic complexity of the immune response. We conducted a comparative observational study of bacterial and viral meningitis to identify pathogen-specific and host-dependent inflammatory pathways that may predict the severity of infection by analysing 54 inflammatory factors using plexing technology. Infection severity and neurological disability were assessed using the modified RANKIN scale. To identify pathogen-specific and host-dependent pathways, plex data were entered into EMBiology(R) software and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. We also investigated pathogen- and host-dependent regulatory effects on blood-brain barrier function using human iPSC-derived endothelial cells as a model. BBB function was characterised at the level of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), endothelial apoptosis and drug transporter activity. We identified 36 factors that are highly differentially regulated in either bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis compared to healthy subjects, 15 of which have not been previously described. GSEA identified previously unknown pathogen-specific pathways including neurotrophin, NOTCH, immune tolerance, antiviral defence and tight junction signalling. As a key finding, we identified 15 host-dependent factors that correlated with the grade of disability and with blood-CSF barrier dysfunction. GSEA revealed stronger responses of neuroprotective (AKT/ERK), anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2/p53) and anti-inflammatory (JAK1/STAT1) pathways in patients with favourable course, whereas patients with severe infection show stronger pro-inflammatory STAT-activation, NKC/CTL-responses and NF{kappa}-B-associated neurotoxicity. BBB analysis supports these findings with dysregulation of TEER, drug transporter activity and induction of endothelial cell death in patients with severe infection. Our data highlight the need for future approaches to personalised medicine that go beyond traditional anti-infective therapy to target the individual immune response.

Author SummeryInfections often cause personal suffering, but also high economic costs. Brain infections such as bacterial or viral meningitis are particularly serious and carry a high risk of death or permanent disability. At the same time, resistance to anti-infective drugs is increasing and fewer new antibiotics are being developed. As a result, there is a great need for translational research to develop new treatments beyond conventional anti-infectives. Due to its strict compartmentalisation, the brain is well suited to identify specific pathogen-dependent, but also host (patient) dependent inflammatory patterns in infections. Using a cohort of patients with a defined group of pathogen-specific meningitis, we investigated the inflammatory patterns in the cerebrospinal fluid and were able to describe new specific pathogen-dependent and new host-dependent immune responses and identify associated signalling pathways. We were also able to show how and at what cellular and molecular level the blood-brain barrier is disrupted by infection. The degree of damage to the blood-brain barrier is an important aspect and has major implications for the course and prognosis of brain infections. Once the pathogen- and host-specific aspects of the immune response are understood, new personalised therapeutic approaches can be developed that directly target the regulation of the individual immune response."
"Protein language models (PLMs) implicitly learn distributional constraints on protein sequences upheld over the course of evolution. As a consequence, the sequence and mutation-level likelihoods of such models form effective zero-shot predictors of mutations. Various schemes have been proposed for exploiting the distributional knowledge captured by PLMs to enhance supervised fitness prediction and sequence design. Of vital importance is the ability to accurately predict fitness in low-data settings. We propose to extend ranking-based loss functions, specifically designed for low data settings, for usage with family-based and masked PLMs. The literature lacks head-to-head comparisons between different prediction strategies, fine-tuning strategies, and different classes of PLMs, making it challenging to identify the best-performing methods. We fill this gap by offering head-to-head comparisons of state-of-the-art approaches. We demonstrate that directly fine-tuning likelihoods via a ranking loss consistently outperforms the current SOTA approaches. Furthermore, we show that when leveraged during multi-round optimisation campaigns, they can drastically improve sequence design."
"Purine metabolism is a promising therapeutic target in cancer; however how cancer cells respond to purine shortage,particularly their adaptation and vulnerabilities, remains unclear. Using the recently developed purine shortage-inducing prodrug DRP-104 and genetic approaches, we investigated these responses in prostate, lung and glioma cancer models. We demonstrate that when de novo purine biosynthesis is compromised, cancer cells employ microtubules to assemble purinosomes, multi-protein complexes of de novo purine biosynthesis enzymes that enhance purine biosynthesis efficiency. While this process enables tumor cells to adapt to purine shortage stress, it also renders them more susceptible to the microtubule-stabilizing chemotherapeutic drug Docetaxel. Furthermore, we show that although cancer cells primarily rely on de novo purine biosynthesis, they also exploit Methylthioadenosine Phosphorylase (MTAP)-mediated purine salvage as a crucial alternative source of purine supply, especially under purine shortage stress. In support of this finding, combining DRP-104 with an MTAP inhibitor significantly enhances tumor suppression in prostate cancer (PCa) models in vivo. Finally, despite the resilience of the purine supply machinery, purine shortage-stressed tumor cells exhibit increased DNA damage and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, which may contribute to impaired immunoevasion and provide a molecular basis of the previously observed DRP-104-induced anti-tumor immunity. Together, these findings reveal purinosome assembly and purine salvage as key mechanisms of cancer cell adaptation and resilience to purine shortage while identifying microtubules, MTAP, and immunoevasion deficits as therapeutic vulnerabilities."
"BackgroundUnderstanding cellular heterogeneity within tissues hinges on knowledge of their spatial context. However, it is still challenging to accurately map cells to their spatial coordinates.

ResultsWe present SC2Spa, a deep learning-based approach that learns intricate spatial relationships from spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. Benchmarking tests show that SC2Spa outperformed other predictors and accurately detected tissue architecture from transcriptome. SC2Spa successfully mapped single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to Visium assay, providing an approach to enhance the resolution for low resolution ST data. Our test showed that SC2Spa performs well for various ST technologies and robust to spatial resolution. In addition, SC2Spa can suggest spatially variable genes that cannot be identified from previous approaches.

ConclusionsSC2Spa is a robust and accurate approach to provide single cells with their spatial location and identify spatially meaningful genes."
"A number of computational methods have been developed in the past for predicting anticancer peptides, including AntiCP and AntiCP2 from our group. While these tools have been widely used by the scientific community, they are not suitable for predicting anticancer proteins. In this study, we present AntiCP3, the first dedicated method for the prediction of anticancer proteins. All models were trained using five-fold cross-validation and evaluated on an independent dataset not used during training. Our initial analysis revealed distinct compositional differences between anticancer peptides and proteins, justifying the need for a separate prediction framework. We first implemented similarity-based approaches, which yielded moderate performance. Subsequently, we developed machine learning and deep learning models using conventional protein features, achieving a maximum AUC of 0.72. The performance improved to an AUC of 0.79 with the incorporation of evolutionary information through PSSM profiles. Further enhancement was observed when embeddings from a fine-tuned protein language model ESM-t33 were used, leading to a best AUC of 0.90. Finally, a hybrid approach combining BLAST with our machine learning model achieved an AUC of 0.91. To facilitate the scientific community, we have implemented AntiCP3 as both a web server and standalone software for the prediction of anticancer proteins (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/anticp3/). We have also deployed our model at hugging face https://huggingface.co/raghavagps-group/anticp3.

Highlights Existing methods have been developed for predicting anticancer peptides.
 AntiCP3 is specifically optimised for predicting anticancer proteins.
 PSI-BLAST used to obtain evolutionary information in form of PSSM profile.
 Hybrid methods developed using alignment free and alignment based approach.
 A web server and standalone tool have been developed to assist the community."
"In the adult brain, GABA exerts either depolarizing or hyperpolarizing effects on neuronal membranes, depending on neuron type, subcellular location, and neuronal activity. Depolarizing GABA typically inhibits neurons through shunting, which is characterized by increased membrane conductance upon GABAA receptor activation; however, it can also excite neurons by recruiting voltage-dependent conductances. The net influence of these opposing actions of depolarizing GABA on glutamatergic synaptic inputs remains incompletely understood. Here, we examined the spatiotemporal characteristics of membrane polarization and shunting mediated by GABAA receptors and assessed their functional impact on the integration of GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs along dendrites. Using whole-cell current-clamp recordings in CA1 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cells (GCs) from rat hippocampal slices, we mimicked GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs with local GABA puffs and glutamate spot-uncaging, respectively. A mathematical model further quantified the relative effects of local shunting and polarization. Depolarizing GABAergic postsynaptic responses (GPSRs) exhibited biphasic actions, exerting inhibitory effects at the synapse through shunting, and excitatory effects distally, where depolarization predominated. The excitatory component also persisted longer than the shunting inhibition. In contrast, hyperpolarizing GPSRs remained consistently inhibitory across both spatial and temporal dimensions. These findings highlight the complex spatiotemporal interplay between shunting and membrane polarization mediated by GABAergic inputs, providing new insights into dendritic computation and neuronal network dynamics."
"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has revolutionized our understanding of gene expression within tissues by preserving spatial context. Over the past few years, this technology has led to a number of paradigm-shifting discoveries that have enabled a more comprehensive understanding of cellular functions and interactions in normal and diseased states. However, ST technologies still face challenges related to resolution, sensitivity, and technical variability. In this study, we evaluate the read coverage of commercialized pre-designed panels using publicly available ST datasets generated from the 10X Genomics and Nanostring platforms. We introduce the Coverage Index (CI) as a quantitative metric to assess the representation of established gene signatures across multiple ST datasets. Our findings reveal that cancer-related gene lists exhibit the highest CI values, while genes encoding for ligands and receptors tend to have low coverage. Additionally, CI analysis can help highlight intrinsic biases in gene panel design, influencing the detection capacity and thereby downstream comprehension of certain biological pathways. The insights gained from this study provide a framework for assessing ST panel performance and optimizing gene panels for future spatial transcriptomic applications."
"The Gompertz equation describes exponential age-increases in animal mortality rate arising from biological aging. Its parameters,  and {beta}, are widely used to evaluate lifespan-extending interventions and human mortality patterns: it is assumed that reduction in {beta} corresponds to deceleration of aging rate, and reduction in  to reduced aging-independent mortality. However, this view has never been empirically validated. We therefore investigated the biological basis of  and {beta}, by simultaneous quantification of mortality and age-related health in long-lived populations of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that reduction in {beta} arises not from decelerated aging but expansion of decrepitude in longer-lived individuals, whereas reduction in  arises from decelerated aging. This empirical re-evaluation of Gompertzian aging inverts and challenges long-standing ideas in the biodemography of aging."
"Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is caused by a deficiency of the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein. Mutations in SMN disrupt mRNA splicing and translation, leading to maladaptive changes in transcriptomes, proteomes, neuroinflammation, and metabolism, which drive motor neuron degeneration in SMA patients. Using a Drosophila SMA model, we found that systemic depletion of Smn leads to accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops), increased DNA damage, dysregulation of amino acids and sugar metabolism and activation of the innate immune response, recapitulating key pathological features reported in mammalian models and severe SMA patients. Persistent DNA damage in Smn-deficient flies alters cell proliferation rates in larval brains and induces extensive cell death in the developing eye. Importantly here, we show that stimulating the resolution of RNA:DNA hybrids with transgenic human RNAse H1 prevents the accumulation of DNA damage and attenuates the transcriptome and amino acid alterations induced by Smn depletion, mitigating the Smn-dependent cellular and developmental abnormalities, in Smn-deficient flies. Our data suggest that depletion of Smn causes an accumulation of aberrant transcripts and chronic DNA damage, which--along with the altered metabolomic profiles associated with Smn deficiency--trigger systemic inflammatory responses, ultimately affecting neuronal function and survival."
"Bile salts (BS) are derived from cholesterol in the liver and act as antimicrobial agents in the intestines by disrupting bacterial cell membranes and inducing oxidative stress. The gut bacterium E. coli is naturally resistant to BS, including the model strain K12 that produces a truncated LPS without O-antigen (OAg). Paradoxically, restoring a wild-type like LPS with OAg sensitises E. coli K12 to exogenous BS. In this study, we investigate this phenomenon. We show that mutations causing truncation of the LPS core oligosaccharide render these strains even more susceptible to BS, similar to the mutant strain MG1655-S{Delta}waaL defective in OAg ligase, primarily due to the accumulation of the lipid-linked intermediate UndPP-OAg. Through the characterisation of BS-resistant suppressor mutants of MG1655-S{Delta}waaL, we identify key genetic disruptions involved in resistance. Notably, we observed the highest BS resistance in strains with a weaker connection between the outer membrane (OM) and peptidoglycan (PG), including strains lacking the major OM-anchored, PG-binding proteins OmpA or Lpp, or expressing versions of these that lack PG-binding. Our data suggest that BS-induced stress in OAg-producing E. coli is due to the spatial constraints between OM and PG, and that mutations disrupting OM-PG interactions alleviate this stress, enhancing BS resistance. These findings provide new insights into a major challenge E. coli faces in the gut environment where it needs to produce OAg for stable colonisation and resists BS. E. coli can only survive BS exposure by fine-tuning the connectivity between its cell envelope layers, which highlights a potential target for modulating bacterial responses to BS in the gut.

Author summaryEnteric bacteria residing in the human gut must withstand the host-derived antimicrobial agents, bile salts (BS), but the underlying resistance mechanisms are not fully elucidated. This study investigates the BS resistance mechanisms in O-antigen (OAg)-producing Escherichia coli K-12. We show that truncation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core oligosaccharides or restoration of OAg production increases BS sensitivity due to the accumulation of UndPP-OAg intermediates. By analysing suppressor mutants, we identify key genetic disruptions, particularly affecting the level of outer membrane-peptidoglycan (OM-PG) interactions involving OmpA and Lpp, which confer heightened BS resistance. Our findings highlight how BS-induced stress is linked to spatial constraints between the OM and PG layer, offering new insights into bacterial adaptation to BS stress. This research may provide new targets for therapeutic interventions to modulate gut microbial responses to BS."
"1.1.1. BackgroundExercise is increasingly recognized as a beneficial intervention for Parkinsons disease (PD), yet the optimal type and intensity of exercise remain unclear. This study investigated the relationship between exercise intensity and neural responses in PD patients, using electroencephalography (EEG) to explore potential neural markers that could be ultimately used to guide exercise intensity.

1.2. MethodEEG data were collected from 14 PD patients (5 females) and 8 healthy controls (HC) performing stationary pedaling exercises at 60 RPM with resistance adjusted to target heart rates of 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 70% of maximum heart rate. Subjects pedaled for 3 minutes at each intensity level in a counterbalanced order. Canonical Time-series Characteristics (Catch-22) features and Multi-set Canonical Correlation Analysis (MCCA) were utilized to identify common profiles of EEG features at increasing exercise intensity across subjects.

1.3. ResultsWe identified a statistically significant MCCA component demonstrating a monotonic relationship with pedaling intensity. The dominant feature in this component was Periodicity Wang (PW), related to the autocorrelation of the EEG. Analysis revealed a consistent trend across features: six features increased with intensity, indicating heightened rhythmic engagement and sustained neural activation, while three features decreased, suggesting reduced variability and enhanced predictability in neural responses. Notably, PD patients exhibited more rigid, consistent response patterns compared to healthy controls (HC), who showed greater flexibility and variability in their neural adaptation across intensities.

1.4. ConclusionThis study highlights the feasibility of using EEG-derived features to track exercise intensity in PD patients, identifying specific neural markers correlating with varying intensity levels. PD subjects demonstrate less inter-subject variability in motor responses to increasing intensity. Our results suggest that EEG biomarkers can be used to assess differing brain involvement with the same exercise of increasing intensity, potentially useful for guiding targeted therapeutic strategies and maximizing the neurological benefits of exercise in PD."
"In many parts of the brain, population tuning to stimuli and behaviour gradually changes over the course of days to weeks in a phenomenon known as representational drift. The tuning stability of individual cells varies over the population, and it remains unclear what drives this heterogeneity. We investigate how a neurons tuning stability relates to its shared variability with other neurons in the population using two published datasets from posterior parietal cortex and visual cortex. We quantified the contribution of pairwise interactions to behaviour or stimulus encoding by partial information decomposition, which breaks down the mutual information between the pairwise neural activity and the external variable into components uniquely provided by each neuron and by their interactions. Information shared by the two neurons is termed  redundant, and information requiring knowledge of the state of both neurons is termed  synergistic. We found that a neurons tuning stability is positively correlated with the strength of its average pairwise redundancy with the population, and that these high-redundancy neurons also tend to show high average pairwise synergy. We hypothesize that subpopulations of neurons show greater stability because they are tuned to salient features common across multiple tasks. Regardless of the mechanistic implications of our work, the stability-redundancy relationship may support improved longitudinal neural decoding in technology that has to track population dynamics over time, such as brain-machine interfaces.

Author summaryActivity in the brain represents information about the outside world and how we interact with it. Recent evidence shows that these representations slowly change day to day, while memories and learned behaviours stay stable. Individual neurons change their relationship to external variables at different rates, and we explore how interactions with other neurons in the population relates to this neuron-to-neuron variability. We find that more stable neurons tend to share information about external variables with many other neurons. Our results suggest there are constraints on how representations can change over time, and that these constraints are exhibited in shared fluctuations in activity among neurons in the population."
"Salmonella is one of the most common foodborne pathogens, resulting in inflammatory gastroenteritis and frequently accompanied by dysbiosis. Gut commensals, such as Lactobacillus species, have been proven to exhibit broad anti-bacterial activities and protect hosts against pathogenic infections. Here, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus strain P118, screened from 290 isolates recovered from fermented yoghurts and healthy piglet intestines using traditional and Caenorhabditis elegans-infection screening strategies, exerts great probiotic properties. Notably, P118 and its supernatant exhibited great antibacterial activities and attenuated C. elegans susceptibility to Salmonella infection. We found that P118 protected mice against Salmonella lethal infections by enhancing colonization resistance, reducing pathogen invasion, alleviating intestinal pro-inflammatory response, and improving microbial dysbiosis and fecal metabolite changes. Microbiota and fecal metabolome analyses suggested P118 administration significantly decreased the relative abundances of potentially harmful microbes (e.g., Salmonella, Anaeroplasma, Klebsiella) and increased the fecal levels of tryptophan and its derivatives (indole, indole-3-acrylic acid, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-methoxyindoleacetate). Deterministic processes determined the gut microbial community assembly of P118-pretreated mice. Integrated omics further demonstrated that P118 probiotic activities in enhancing host tolerance to Salmonella infection were mediated by microbe-derived tryptophan/indole metabolites (e.g., indole-3-acrylic acid, indole, tryptophan, 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid, and 5-hydroxytryptophan). Collective results demonstrate that L. rhamnosus P118 could enhance host tolerance to Salmonella infections via various pathways, including direct antibacterial actions, inhibiting Salmonella colonization and invasion, attenuating pro-inflammatory responses of intestinal macrophages, and modulating gut microbiota mediated by microbe-derived indole metabolites."
"1.Elucidating the neural basis of perceptual biases, such as those produced by visual illusions, can provide powerful insights into the neural mechanisms of perceptual inference. However, studying the subjective percepts of animals poses a fundamental challenge: unlike human participants, animals cannot be verbally instructed to report what they see, hear, or feel. Instead, they must be trained to perform a task for reward, and researchers must infer from their responses what the animal perceived. However, animals responses are shaped by reward feedback, thus raising the major concern that the reward regimen may alter the animals decision strategy or even their intrinsic perceptual biases. Using simulations of a reinforcement learning agent, we demonstrate that conventional reward strategies fail to allow accurate estimation of perceptual biases. We developed a method that estimates perceptual bias during task performance and then computes the reward for each trial based on the evolving estimate of the animals perceptual bias. Our approach makes use of multiple stimulus contexts to dissociate perceptual biases from decision-related biases. Starting with an informative prior, our Bayesian method updates a posterior over the perceptual bias after each trial. The prior can be specified based on data from past sessions, thus reducing the variability of the online estimates and allowing it to converge to a stable estimate over a small number of trials. After validating our method on synthetic data, we apply it to estimate perceptual biases of monkeys in a motion direction discrimination task in which varying background optic flow induces robust perceptual biases. This method overcomes an important challenge to understanding the neural basis of subjective percepts."
"2'-O-methylation (Nm) is an abundant RNA modification exists on different mammalian RNA species. However, potential Nm recognition by proteins has not been extensively explored. Here, we employed RNA affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry to identify Nm-binding proteins. The candidates exhibit enriched binding at known Nm sites. Interestingly, some candidates display nuclear localization and functions. We focused on the splicing factor FUBP1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) validated preference of FUBP1 to Nm-modified RNA. As FUBP1 predominantly binds intronic regions, we profiled Nm sites in chromatin-associated RNA (caRNA) and found Nm enrichment within introns. Depletion of Nm led to increased exon skipping, suggesting Nm-dependent splicing regulation. The caRNA Nm sites overlap with FUBP1 binding sites, and Nm depletion reduced FUBP1 occupancy on modified regions. Furthermore, FUBP1 depletion induced exon skipping in Nm-modified genes, supporting its role in mediating Nm-dependent splicing regulation. Overall, our findings identify FUBP1 as an Nm-binding protein and uncover previously unrecognized nuclear functions for RNA Nm modification."
"Cells regulate protein synthesis in response to fluctuating nutrient availability through coordinated mechanisms that affect both translation initiation and elongation. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)--leucine, isoleucine, and valine--are essential nutrients with a significant impact on cellular physiology. However, how their simultaneous depletion affects translation remains largely unclear. Here, we examined the immediate effects of short-term BCAA limitation on translational dynamics in mammalian cells. We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) on NIH3T3 cells subjected to single, double, or triple BCAA deprivation. Our analyses revealed increased ribosome dwell times in all starvation conditions, with pronounced stalling at all valine codons during valine and triple starvation, while leucine and isoleucine starvation produced milder, codon-specific effects. Notably, we could show that isoleucine starvation-specific stalling largely diminished under triple starvation, likely due to early elongation bottlenecks at valine codons. Correlating these stalling events with tRNA charging levels revealed distinct tRNA isoacceptor regulation in each starvation condition. In addition, integrating quantitative proteomics showed that many proteins downregulated under BCAA deprivation harbor stalling sites, suggesting that compromised elongation contributes to decreased protein output. Together, these findings suggest that differential ribosome stalling under BCAA starvation reflects a balance between amino acid supply, tRNA charging dynamics, and stress-response signaling, illustrating that codon choice shapes the translational landscape under nutrient limitation."
"Surface binding and surface phase separation of cytosolic scaffold proteins on lipid membranes are involved in many cellular processes such as cell signaling, cell adhesion, and cortex regulation. However, the interplay between surface binding and surface phase separation is poorly understood. In this work, we study this interplay by deriving a general thermodynamic model and applying it to in vitro reconstitution experiments of membrane-binding proteins involved in tight junction initiation. Our theory extends the classical surface binding isotherm to account for non-dilute and heterogeneous conditions where components can phase separate. Using this framework we demonstrate how surface phase separation is governed by the interaction strength among membrane-bound scaffold proteins and their binding affinity to the membrane surface. Comparing the theory to reconstitution experiments, we show that tuning the oligomerization state of the adhesion receptors in the membrane controls surface phase transition and patterning of the scaffold protein ZO1. These findings suggest a fundamental role of the interplay between non-dilute surface binding and surface phase separation in the formation of the tight junction. More broadly, our work highlights non-dilute surface binding and surface phase separation as a common organizational principle for membrane-associated structures in living cells."
"IntroductionChildhood is a critical period for the development of executive functioning skills, including selective attention and inhibitory control, which are essential for cognitive development. Optimal brain development during this time requires appropriate levels of macronutrient intake. Metabolomics can offer valuable insights into which metabolites cognitive functioning and the underlying gut-brain interactions.

ObjectivesThis study aimed to explore to use of breathomics to investigate associations between exhaled metabolites and executive functioning in children.

MethodsChildren (8-10 years; N = 31) were recruited via flyers at schools and after-school care. The assessment of executive functioning was done using Eriksen flanker task. Breath samples were collected in Tedlar(R) bags and analyzed with proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). On-breath peaks were selected and subjected to partial least squares (PLS) regression. Significance multivariate correlation (sMC) was used afterwards to select metabolites bearing predictive power towards executive functioning.

ResultsGut microbiome-related metabolites (methane, ethanol, and butyric acid) present in exhaled breath were associated with an improved executive functioning, whereas isoprene was linked to reduced executive functioning. Additionally, increased levels of inflammatory markers, ethylene and acetaldehyde, were associated with a higher compatibility effect in error rates, suggesting diminished cognitive control. These VOCs were putatively linked with specific gut microbial taxa; for instance, reduced Bacteroidetes abundance (associated with methane production) is associated with decreased inhibitory control, while Enterobacteriaceae were linked to lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation which is also a process that causes increased ethylene production.

ConclusionThis proof-of-concept study demonstrates that VOCs in exhaled breath could serve as a promising non-invasive tool for assessing gut-brain interactions related to executive functioning in children."
"Understanding how cells mitigate lysosomal damage is critical for unraveling pathogenic mechanisms of lysosome-related diseases. Here we use organelle-specific proteomics in iPSC-derived neurons (i3Neuron) and an in vitro lysosome-damaging assay to demonstrate that lysosome damage, caused by the aggregation of Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Neuronal 4 (CLN4)-linked DNAJC5 mutants on lysosomal membranes, serves as a critical pathogenic linchpin in CLN4-associated neurodegeneration. Intriguingly, in non-neuronal cells, a ubiquitin-dependent microautophagy mechanism downregulates CLN4 aggregates to counteract CLN4-associated lysotoxicity. Genome-wide CRISPR screens identify the ubiquitin ligase CHIP as a central microautophagy regulator that confers ubiquitin-dependent lysosome protection. Importantly, CHIPs lysosome protection function is transferrable, as ectopic CHIP improves lysosomal function in CLN4 i3Neurons, and effectively alleviates lipofuscin accumulation and neurodegeneration in a Drosophila CLN4 disease model. Our study establishes CHIP-mediated microautophagy as a key organelle damage guardian that preserves lysosome integrity, offering new insights into therapeutic development for CLN4 and other lysosome-related neurodegenerative diseases."
"The discovery of a new extremophile alga, Chlamydomonas pacifica, provides an opportunity to expand on heterologous protein expression beyond the traditional Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. C. pacifica is a unicellular extremophile capable of surviving at high pH, high temperatures, and high salinity. These various growth conditions allow C. pacifica to outcompete any invading contaminants in open-air environments. Developing this novel species as a platform for recombinant protein production could significantly advance commercial microalgal recombinant protein production. We have previously shown that C. reinhardtii can secrete a plastic-degrading enzyme: a PETase known as PHL7. This PETase is capable of cleaving ester bonds and has been used commercially for the degradation of PET plastics. However, the expression of such an enzyme has yet to be done in open raceway ponds and on a large scale. Here, we describe the culturing of PHL7 transgenic C. pacifica strain in three 80L raceway ponds and the measurements of recombinant enzymatic expression and activity found in the culture media. Our work provides proof of concept that this new organism can produce functional PHL7 enzymes in addition to producing the valuable components that inherently exist in the C. pacifica algae biomass.

"Many species distribution models (SDMs) incorporate external information, such as environmental or habitat features, yet the majority overlook age-specific information. Including age information may be particularly valuable for species exhibiting age-related spatial patterns driven by ontogenetic shifts, recruitment dynamics, and selective fishing pressures. Here, we develop an age-structured SDM framework using data from the west coast of the USA and concentrate on two species with distinct life histories: North Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) and sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria). We validate our approach by forecasting age classes across survey locations in future years; these results highlight that forecast models have predictive skill (sablefish more so than hake) and that the predictive ability is highest for older age classes. Using predictions of age-1 sablefish as an example, we demonstrate how our models may be used to forecast future bycatch risk in space, helping increase the efficiency of fisheries. Our framework is applicable to a wide range of survey types and platforms around the world and supports the development of spatially explicit management strategies and optimal allocation of fishing effort."
"Deciphering the cell of origin (COO) of different cancers is critical for understanding tumor development and improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in oncology. Previous studies demonstrated that the COO chromatin accessibility landscape shapes the genomic distribution of cancer somatic mutations. We leveraged machine learning, 559 single-cell chromatin accessibility cellular profiles, and 2,734 whole genome sequencing patient samples to predict the COO of 36 cancer subtypes with high robustness and accuracy, confirming both the known anatomical and cellular origins of numerous human cancers, often at cell subset resolution. Importantly, our data-driven approach predicts that basal cells give rise to small cell lung cancers, challenging the traditional view of neuroendocrine COO. Our study also highlights distinct cellular trajectories during cancer development of different histological subtypes and uncovers an intermediate metaplastic state during tumorigenesis for multiple gastrointestinal cancers, which have important implications for cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment stratification."
"1.Oyster aquaculture is a vital component of global marine ecosystems and food production, yet winter mortality events threaten both ecological stability and economic viability. Traditional selective breeding methods, reliant on phenotypic traits and slow generational cycles, struggle to address these challenges efficiently. This study introduces an innovative approach integrating machine learning with multi-omics data genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics to optimize oyster breeding for resilience and quality. By analyzing high-resolution datasets encompassing genetic markers, environmental stressors, and survival metrics, our ML models identified key SNPs linked to cold tolerance and disease resistance. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) accelerated breeding cycles, while predictive algorithms achieved 92.4% accuracy in forecasting survival and growth traits. Controlled trials demonstrated a 30% reduction in winter mortality and a 25% improvement in growth rates among ML-selected oyster lineages compared to traditional methods. Additionally, a smartphone-based diagnostic tool was developed to enable real-time monitoring of oyster health, empowering farmers to adapt feeding and environmental strategies dynamically.

This research bridges the gap between conventional aquaculture and computational innovation, offering a scalable framework to enhance genetic diversity, sustainability, and yield. By replacing trial-and-error practices with data-driven precision, our approach not only mitigates immediate industry challenges but also establishes a pathway for climate-resilient aquaculture. The fusion of ML with multi-omics technologies marks a transformative shift, enabling breeders to make rapid, evidence-based decisions that harmonize ecological stewardship with commercial demands."
"Pepper mild mottle virus (Tobamovirus capsica, PMMoV) is a plant virus in the genus Tobamovirus that infects peppers and other members of the family Solanaceae. The virus is transmitted mechanically, poses a significant threat to crops globally, and is one of the most abundant viruses found in human feces and wastewater. Two colorimetric reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assays were developed to detect PMMoV, one targeting the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (PMMoV_RdRp) and one targeting the coat protein (PMMoV_CP). Synthetic gBlock positive controls were used to determine the detection limit of each assay. PMMoV_RdRp detected PMMoV at concentrations greater than or equal to 100 copies/L, the same sensitivity as the RT-PCR assay for this gene. In contrast, the detection limit of the PMMoV_CP RT-LAMP assay was an order of magnitude greater. Both assays were specific to PMMoV and did not amplify plant host tissue or related tobamoviruses. Since these RT-LAMP assays do not require specialized laboratory equipment and yield positive results within 20-30 minutes, they are advantageous for point-of-use testing. Overall, the RT-LAMP assays described here are sensitive, specific, and more rapid than existing methods for PMMoV detection and quantification and thus have potential widespread applications for agriculture, wastewater treatment assessment, recreational water quality testing, and food safety.

"Table olives are among the most ancient and important fermented foods of the Mediterranean basin. Their production is still strongly related to traditional practices, and the lack of thermal treatments, the reliance on natural contamination and on selective factors (NaCl, anaerobiosis, occurrence of food phenolics, etc.) determine the dynamics of the microbial community. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts have a pivotal role in table olive microbial communities, but several halophilic and alkalophilic microorganisms may also contribute, positively or negatively, to the quality.

We have use metataxonomic data extracted from the FoodMicrobionet database to provide quantitative insights on the structure of bacterial and fungal microbial communities of table olvies and to identify core genera in different trade preparations.

A set of bacterial genera may be representative of the dominating core microbiota in table olives, with Celerinatantimonas and Lactiplantibacillus as the most prevalent genera, followed by several LAB, halophilic and alkalophilic lactic acid bacteria (HALAB) and Gram negatives, including non-halophilic species. Similarly, 3 fungal genera (Pichia, Candida and Wickerhamomyces) were the most abundant and prevalent among those representing the core microbiota of table olives.

The distribution of both bacteria and yeasts varied significantly in different olive varieties, among olives, brines and contact surfaces or materials, and at different production stages, and no clear grouping related to the combination of ripeness and trade preparation was found, although HALAB were characteristically abundant in Spanish style green olives. Addition of starter cultures affected the composition and dynamics of microbial communities to a variable extent.

"Changes to organismal growth induced by environmental stress are orchestrated at the cellular level. These periods of stress may be followed by recovery periods, when plants have the opportunity to return to normal growth conditions. However, the cell cycle mechanisms underlying recovery are poorly understood. We tested the cell cycle regulation in roots during control, stress, and recovery period for salt, osmotic, cold, and heat stresses using Arabidopsis thaliana, Brachypodium distachyon and Lolium multiflorum. During the salt and cold stress conditions, the cell cycle pauses at gap phase and is released from gap phase during stress recovery, which depends on CDKA;1 and ICK1. Cold stress and recovery, which specifically relies on cell division, follows a conserved ""pause and play"" mechanism of cell cycle."
"A multi-protein system called the divisome promotes bacterial division. This apparatus synthesizes the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall layer that forms the daughter cell poles and protects them from osmotic lysis. In the model Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, PG synthases called class A penicillin-binding proteins (aPBPs) have been proposed to play crucial roles in division. However, there is limited experimental support for aPBPs playing a specialized role in division that is distinct from their general function in the expansion and fortification of the PG matrix. Here, we present in situ cryogenic electron tomography data indicating that the aPBP-type enzyme PBP1b is required to produce a wedge-like density of PG at the division site. Furthermore, atomic force and live cell microscopy showed that loss of this structure weakens the division site and renders it susceptible to lysis. Surprisingly, we found that the lipoprotein activator LpoB needed to promote the general function of PBP1b was not required for normal division site architecture or its integrity. Additionally, we show that of the two PBP1b isoforms produced in cells, it is the one with an extended cytoplasmic N-terminus that functions in division, likely via recruitment by the FtsA component of the divisome. Altogether, our results demonstrate that PBP1b plays a specialized, LpoB-independent role in E. coli cell division involving the biogenesis of a PG structure that prevents osmotic rupture. The conservation of aPBPs with extended cytoplasmic N-termini suggests that other Gram-negative bacteria may use similar mechanisms to reinforce their division site."
"Pathogenic variants in MECP2 commonly lead to Rett syndrome, where MECP2s function as a DNA cytosine methylation reader is believed critical. MECP2 variants are also catalogued in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including nine missense variants which had no known clinical significance at the start of this study. To assess these nine variants as risk alleles for ASD, we developed MECP2 variant functional assays using budding yeast and Drosophila. We calibrated these assays with known pathogenic and benign variants. Our data predict that four ASD variants are loss of function and five are functional. Protein destabilization offers insight into the altered function of some of these variants. Notably, yeast and Drosophila lack DNA methylation, yet all Rett pathogenic and ASD variants located in the methyl DNA binding domain that we analyzed proved to be loss of function, suggesting a clinically-relevant role for non-methyl DNA-binding by MECP2."
"Cardiac cycle duration, or interbeat interval (IBI), is the period from one heartbeat to the next. IBI changes from cycle to cycle. Periods with longer IBI are associated with higher sensitivity to external sensory stimuli (exteroception). Warning cues induce a state of attentive anticipation characterized by an increase in IBI (anticipatory cardiac deceleration) and faster reaction times. Ageing reduces the increase in IBI induced by warning cues and response speed. However, it is unclear which mechanism, if any, connects IBI with reaction time. The heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) is a cortical response evoked by the heartbeat, modulated by attention and associated with sensitivity to external sensory stimuli. HEP might be affected by IBI and mediate the association between cardiac output and cortical processing.

We investigated if the HEP was affected by warning cues as well as spontaneous fluctuations in IBI. To explore the impact of age-related changes in cardiac responses, we included young and older people [N = 33/29; 26/23 women; mean age 23/61 years]. We analysed the electroencephalograms and electrocardiograms simultaneously acquired during auditory cued simple reaction time and go/no-go tasks.

The warning cue did not induce significant changes in the HEP. Yet, fluctuations in IBI (not locked with the warning cue) affected the HEP and HEP amplitude was associated with average reaction time in the older group. However, on a trial-by-trial basis, reaction time was independent from IBI fluctuations.

In conclusion, we found no evidence that the HEP mediates the effect of attention orienting on reaction time."
"Protein tertiary structure prediction models like AlphaFold2 have revolutionized the field with unprecedented accuracy. Yet predicting structural changes arising from single amino acid mutations remains a challenge. The complexity introduced by these mutations calls for models that can incorporate mutational information into their predictions. We propose a novel refinement strategy for protein secondary structure prediction that leverages missense mutational data. As part of this strategy, we introduce Mut2Dens, a model that not only yields improved consistency of predictions for mutational data, but also maintains robust predictive performance on non-mutational datasets. Mut2Dens takes multiple predicted secondary structures and generates a mutation-aware secondary structure. This awareness comes from our mutational dataset, learning to avoid common mistakes in prediction methods after a missense mutation occurs. In particular, Mut2Dens employs the extremely randomized trees (ExtraTree) algorithm to avoid overfitting and makes effective use of the limited mutational data available from experimentally determined three-dimensional structures. By combining predictions from highly accurate structure prediction models, we create an ensemble that integrates their strengths while enhancing mutational capabilities. This refinement strategy also improves the non-mutational performance of state-of-the-art methods by addressing their most inaccurate and least confident predictions. Moreover, it reduces improbable outcomes in mutated protein structures--such as transforming{pi} -helices into {beta}-sheets--that can still occur in current prediction models. Finally, by using interpretable machine learning algorithms (e.g., ExtraTree), we can reveal the underlying biological knowledge from the refinement model; the insights gained from Mut2Dens can be corroborated with known mutational outcomes, helping users pinpoint discrepancies across structure prediction models and make more informed decisions regarding the predicted structures. The data utilized here is available at https://github.com/ivanpmartell/sam-models."
"Speech-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can offer an intuitive means of communication for those who have lost the ability to speak due to paralysis. Significant progress has been made in classifying individual words from high numbers of electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrodes on the sensorimotor cortex (SMC). As implantations of larger grids with more ECoG electrodes are associated with higher surgical risk, we here examined whether confined electrode configurations can match the classification accuracy of larger grids. To this end, we analyzed data from eight able-bodied participants with high-density ECoG grids (64 to 128 electrodes) who performed a task that involved speaking 12 Dutch words. Word pronunciation was associated with changes in high frequency band activity in two SMC foci, one in the ventral SMC and another in the dorsal SMC. Using a combinatorics approach, we found that a smaller, rectangular, configuration with a surface area of 325 mm2 to 561 mm2 (32 electrodes) could achieve a word classification accuracy similar to that of the larger grids: 76{+/-}16% versus 75{+/-}17% across participants, respectively (practical chance level 16.7%). The best configurations were oriented vertically and centered on the central sulcus. These findings indicate that a 32-electrode ECoG grid placed optimally can be sufficient for achieving high word classification accuracy on a closed set of words. We conclude that targeted placement of small ECoG grids can reduce surgical demands on end users and justify energy- and complexity-efficient designs of fully implantable BCI devices for individuals with severe paralysis."
"Luminal B breast cancer (LBBC) is on the rise worldwide, with both incidence and mortality rates steadily increasing. Early detection proves difficult due to its aggressive characteristics, most notably its heightened proliferation rate and the complex interplay of molecular biomarkers, particularly in more advanced stages. In the present study, we conducted an in silico analysis of LBBC cell lines using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) microarray dataset, which includes 30 LBBC and 11 normal samples. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using RStudio. A series of analyses, including cancer data interrogation via pan-cancer analysis, eXpression2Kinases (X2K), and the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMAP), was carried out to elucidate the underlying signaling pathways, transcription factors (TFs), and kinases, as well as to perform stemformatics analysis. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were reconstructed using STRING and Cytoscape, enabling the identification of co-expressed and hub genes through the cytoHubba plug-in. Of note, FGF2, EGFR, ADIPOQ, LIPE, MET, IGF1, FGF1, EGF, FGF7, and PPARG were identified as the top 10 driver genes; RELA, PPARG, CTCF, EGR1, and NFE2L2 were detected as predominant TFs in LBBC; and CDK1, CDK2, MAPK3, CSNK2A1, and MAPK14 were identified as potential biomarkers through hub gene clustering. Further analysis indicated hsa-mir-221-3p and hsa-mir-29a-3p as key miRNAs targeting LBBC-related genes. Collectively, our findings highlighted LBBC-associated genes, TFs, miRNAs, and pathways as prospective biomarkers, providing insights into LBBC diagnosis and therapeutic approaches."
"Host-pathogen interactions are shaped by the nature of the pathogen and by host-related factors. The human host responses can be characterized in microbe-stimulated immune cells using transcriptomics. We set out to characterize gene expression changes as a result of microbial in vitro stimulation in RPMI-cultured human primary immune cells, using four pathogen ligands representing bacteria (LPS and S. aureus), viruses (Poly(I:C)) and fungi (C. albicans) for 4 and 24 hours, resulting in a total of 52 samples for analysis. We analyze the transcriptional changes on gene- and pathway level, highlighting common and distinct effects of pathogen stimulation. We highlight genes without a known function that were differentially expressed as a common effect of pathogen stimulation. We find uncharacterized genes such as KIAA0040 and CYRIA to be co-expressed with genes involved in innate immunity and downstream signaling from the PRRs, respectively. We identify 901 variants in uncharacterized genes in a cohort of patients with rare immune disorders, prioritizing 5 candidate variants in 4 genes that could underly these diseases. Our results therefore indicate the potential role of these genes the human immune response and provides candidate variants with potential relevance in rare immune-mediated diseases."
"Single-cell transcriptomics has revolutionized our understanding of neurodevelopmental cell identities, yet, predicting a cell types developmental state from its transcriptome remains a challenge. We perform a meta-analysis of developing human brain datasets comprising over 2.8 million cells, identifying both tissue-level and cell-autonomous predictors of developmental age. While tissue composition predicts age within individual studies, it fails to generalize, whereas specific cell type proportions reliably track developmental time across datasets. Training regularized regression models to infer cell-autonomous maturation, we find that a cell type-agnostic model achieves the highest accuracy (error = 2.6 weeks), robustly capturing developmental dynamics across diverse cell types and datasets. This model generalizes to human neural organoids, accurately predicting normal developmental trajectories (R = 0.91) and disease-induced shifts in vitro. Furthermore, it extends to the developing mouse brain, revealing an accelerated developmental tempo relative to humans. Our work provides a unified framework for comparing neurodevelopment across contexts, model systems, and species."
"Pain and welfare monitoring is essential for ethical animal testing, but current cage-side assessments are qualitative and subjective. Here we present the GrimACE, the first fully standardised and automated cage-side monitoring tool for mice, the most widely used animals in research. The GrimACE uses computer vision to provide automated mouse grimace scale (MGS) assessment together with pose estimation in a dark, safe environment. We validated the system by analysing pain after brain surgeries (craniotomies) with head implants under two analgesia regimes. Human-expert and automated MGS scores showed very high correlation (Pearson's r=0.87). Both expert and automated scores revealed that a moderate increase in pain can be detected for up to 48 hours after surgeries, but that both a single dose of meloxicam (5mg/kg s.c.) or 3 doses of buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg) + meloxicam (5mg/kg s.c.) provide adequate and comparable pain management. Simultaneous pose estimation demonstrated that mice receiving buprenorphine + meloxicam showed increased movement 4h after surgery, indicative of hyperactivity, a well-known side-effect of opioid treatment. Significant weight loss was also detected in the buprenorphine + meloxicam treatment group compared to the meloxicam-only group. Additionally, detailed BehaviorFlow analysis and automated MGS scoring of control animals suggests that habituation to the GrimACE system is unnecessary, and that measurements can be repeated multiple times, ensuring standardised post-operative recovery monitoring."
"Shape changeable hydrogel scaffolds recapitulating morphological dynamism of native tissues have emerged as an elegant tool for future tissue engineering (TE) applications, due to their capability to create morphodynamical tissues with complex architectures. Hydrogel scaffolds capable of preprogrammable, reprogrammable and/or reversible shape transformations would widely expand the scope of possible temporal shape changes. Current morphable hydrogels are mostly based on multimaterial, multilayered structures, which involve complicated and time-consuming fabrication protocols, and are often limited to single unidirectional deformation. This work reports on the development of a transformable hydrogel system using a fast, simple, and robust fabrication approach for manipulating the shapes of soft tissues at defined maturation states. Simply by using an ion-transfer printing (ITP) technology (i.e., transferring Ca2+ from an ion reservoir with filter paper and subsequent covering on a preformed alginate-derived hydrogel), a tunable Ca2+ crosslinking density gradient across the hydrogel thickness has been incorporated, which enables preprogrammable deformations upon further swelling in cell culture media. Combining with a surface patterning technology, cell-laden constructs (bioconstructs) capable of morphing in multiple directions are deformed into sophisticated configurations. Not only can the deformed bioconstructs recover their original shapes by chemical treatment, but at user-defined times they can also be incorporated with new, different spatially controlled gradient crosslinking via the ITP process, conferring 3D bioconstruct shape reprogrammability. In this manner, unique ""3D-to-3D"" shape conversions have been realized. Finally, we demonstrated effective shape manipulation in engineered cartilage-like tissue constructs using this strategy. These morphable scaffolds may advance 4D TE by enabling more sophisticated spatiotemporal control over construct shape evolution."
"Understanding the link between structure and function in proteins is fundamental in molecular biology and proteomics. A central question in this context is whether allostery -- where the binding of a molecule at one site affects the activity of a distant site -- emerges as a further manifestation of the intricate interplay between structure, function, and intrinsic dynamics.

This study explores how allosteric regulation is modified when intrinsic protein dynamics operate under out-of-equilibrium conditions. To this purpose, we introduce a simple nonequilibrium model of protein dynamics, inspired by active matter systems, by generalizing the widely employed Gaussian Network Model (GNM) to incorporate non-thermal effects. Our approach underscores the advantage of framing allostery as a causal process by using, as a benchmark system, the second PDZ domain of the human phosphatase hPTP1E that mediates protein-protein interactions.

We employ causal indicators, such as response functions and transfer entropy, to identify the network of PDZ2 residues through which the allosteric signal propagates across the protein structure. These indicators reveal specific regions that align well with experimental observations. Furthermore, our results suggest that deviations from purely thermal fluctuations can significantly influence allosteric communication by introducing distinct timescales and memory effects. This influence is particularly relevant when the allosteric response unfolds on timescales incompatible with relaxation to equilibrium. Accordingly, non-thermal fluctuations may become essential for accurately describing protein responses to ligand binding and developing a comprehensive understanding of allosteric regulation."
"Roots are the primary site for sensing salt, making them critical to understanding how plants adapt to salinity. Unraveling the genetic and molecular mechanisms that maintain root growth under salt stress is essential for developing resilient crops. Tomatoes are vulnerable to salinity, as over 50% of arable land is projected to become saline by 2050. While salt stress effects on tomato seed germination, shoot growth, and fruit yield are well-documented, the genetic basis of root development under salinity remains underexplored. Previous studies focused on physiological responses of roots in a narrow range of cultivated-tomatoes, overlooking the genetic diversity for salt resilience in wild-relatives like Solanum pimpinellifolium. Here, we investigated salt-induced changes in root system architecture (RSA) across a natural diversity panel of 220 wild- and 25 cultivated-tomato varieties. We identified tolerant accessions with different RSA strategies; prioritizing lateral root elongation versus emergence. To identify genes involved in specific aspects of lateral root development, an F1 hybrid was generated that exhibited both parents combined characteristics. An F2-segregating population was then used to identify four distinct subpopulations for Bulk Segregant Analysis (BSA). Simultaneously, we conducted Genome-Wide-Association Studies (GWAS) on root architecture of wild-tomato accessions under salt stress. By integrating the results of BSA and GWAS, we identified 22 candidates involved in the maintenance of root architecture. We utilized RNA-Seq to examine transcriptome reprogramming of the 22 genes in tomato accessions with contrasting lateral root responses. This approach resulted in the identification of 2 genes, AP2-like-ethylene-responsive transcription factor TOE3 and L-ascorbate peroxidase. Using exogenous ethylene, we demonstrated that root architecture exhibits plasticity, which benefits the plant by reducing Na+ accumulation. We profiled H2O2 waves across root systems of tomatoes, emphasizing the role of ROS in maintaining root system architecture under salt stress. These findings provide novel genetic targets for enhancing salt resilience in tomatoes, opening avenues for future research and breeding programs."
"Inflammation is a vital defense mechanism activated in response to injury or infection, which induces the release of cytokines and chemokines to promote tissue repair. However, persistent inflammation may result in the development of autoimmune diseases.

During pathological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, HMGB1 is kept in its reduced isoform and can complex with CXCL12 enhancing cell migration and exacerbating the immune responses. Small organic compounds selective for HMGB1 have been previously reported to be able to disrupt the CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex, but due to their low affinity, they are unsuitable for further development as novel anti-inflammatory drugs.

We previously reported a peptide (HBP08) that binds to HMGB1 with high affinity (Kd = 0.8 {micro}M), and blocks the activity of the heterocomplex, in line with a wide literature that supports the use of peptides to design protein-protein interaction inhibitors. In the present work, we computationally optimized the HBP08 peptide sequence, finding new analogues endowed with improved affinity for HMGB1. In particular, HBP08-2 inhibited the activity of the CXCL12/HMGB1 heterocomplex with an IC50 10-fold lower (3.31 {micro}M) and displayed a Kd 28-fold lower (28.1 {+/-} 7.0 nM) than the parent peptide HBP08."
"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWGenetic recombination can speed up or slow down evolution toward the global optimum. For analyzing mutational trajectories to the optimum it is conventional to study peaks in the fitness landscapes. However, such mutational peaks cannot provide a complete picture of the interplay between mutations, recombination and selection. Here we use recombination peaks as an additional tool. Informally, a recombination peak is a set of genotypes such that no allele shuffling among members can improve average fitness. If conventional peaks are optimal with respect to mutations, then recombination peaks are optimal with respect to recombination. The approach applies to general fitness landscapes with an arbitrary number of alleles and loci, and our experiments involve up to five alleles.

One of the most frequently observed patterns of epistasis in nature is diminishing returns epistasis, i.e., the combined effect of beneficial mutations is smaller than a multi-plicative expectation would predict. Recombination tends to speed up adaptation toward a peak whenever there is a systematic pattern of diminishing returns epistasis near the peak. The opposite is true for increasing returns epistasis. Mixed curvature is more challenging to analyze. Recombination peaks provide a language for describing effects of recombination, and threshold results are discussed accordingly. The experiments suggest that recombination is more likely to speed up adaptation for larger fitness landscapes."
"CD19-directed CAR T cells treat cancer, but also cause immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Despite strong epidemiologic links between cytokine release syndrome and ICANS, it is uncertain how elevated systemic cytokines and activated immune cells cause brain dysfunction. We previously showed that leukocytes plug brain capillaries in an immunocompetent mouse model of CD19-CAR neurotoxicity. Here, we used the same model to explore how integrin activation and endothelial adhesion molecule expression contribute to capillary plugging. In vivo two-photon imaging revealed increased expression of ICAM-1 on brain capillaries, with spatially restricted VCAM-1 increases. TNF, IFN-{gamma}, and IL-1{beta} at concentrations equivalent to CAR T cell patient blood levels upregulated ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in brain microendothelial cells. In mice, CAR T cells strongly upregulated VLA-4 (integrin 4{beta}1) affinity to VCAM-1, but not affinity of LFA-1 (integrin L{beta}2) to ICAM-1. Blocking integrin 4 but not integrin L improved ICANS behavior in mice. In human CAR T cell patients, increased soluble ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 are associated with ICANS, and integrin 4 but not integrin L is upregulated in CAR T cells after infusion. Our study highlights that cytokine-driven upregulation of endothelial-leukocyte adhesion may be sufficient to induce neurovascular dysfunction in CAR T cell patients.

"The big potassium (BK) channels remain open with a small limiting probability of Po [~] 10-7 at minimal Ca2+ and negative voltages < -100 mV. The molecular origin and functional significance of such ""intrinsic opening"" are not understood. Here we combine atomistic simulations and electrophysiological experiments to show that the intrinsic opening of BK channels is an inherent property of the vapor barrier, generated by hydrophobic dewetting of the BK inner pore in the deactivated state. The vapor barrier only gives rise to a finite free energy barrier, of [~] 8 kcal/mol, and cannot completely shut down K+ flow even when the voltage sensor domains are fully deactivated. This results in the leaking currents that can be measured at negative voltages as the indication of intrinsic opening. The shallow limiting slope of Po at negative voltages results primarily from the electric field effects on the permeating ion through the vapor barrier. We further demonstrate that the vapor barrier can be perturbed by inner pore mutations and truncation of the cytosolic domains, leading to predicable changes in limiting slope measurements. Therefore, the intrinsic opening in BK channels, and possibly in other ion channels, opens up an opportunity to experimentally study hydrophobic gating. Our results further suggest that intrinsic opening in BK channels is the fundamental basis for the allosteric mechanism of activation by both voltage and Ca2+."
"MotivationWhile there are a variety of file formats for storing reference-sequence-aligned genotype data, many are complex or inefficient. Programming language support for such formats is often limited. A file format that is simple to understand and implement - yet fast and small - is helpful for research on highly scalable bioinformatics.

ResultsWe present the Indexable Genotype Data (IGD) file format, a simple uncompressed binary format that can be more than 100 times faster and 3.5 times smaller than vcf.gz on Biobank-scale whole-genome sequence data. The implementation for reading and writing IGD in Python is under 350 lines of code, which reflects the simplicity of the format.

"The mechanisms regulating transcriptional changes in brain aging remain poorly understood. Here, we use single-cell epigenomics to profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression across eight brain regions in the mouse brain at 2, 9, and 18 months of age. In addition to a significant decline in progenitor cell populations involved in neurogenesis and myelination, we observed widespread and concordant changes of transcription and chromatin accessibility during aging in glial and neuronal cell types. These alterations are accompanied by dysregulation of master transcription factors and a shift toward stress-responsive programs driven by AP-1, indicating a progressive loss of cell identity with aging. We also identify region- and cell-type-specific heterochromatin decay, characterized by increased accessibility at H3K9me3-marked domains, activation of transposable elements, and upregulation of long non-coding RNAs, particularly in glutamatergic neurons. Together, these results reveal age-related disruption of heterochromatin maintenance and transcriptional programs, identify vulnerable brain regions and cell types, and pinpoint key molecular pathways altered in brain aging.

"For humans, being looked at directly can boost our readiness to follow anothers gaze, but can monkeys invite an observer to engage with them in the same way? We trained three rhesus macaques on a head gaze-following task in which the portrait of a demonstrator monkey would face the viewer before turning to look at a distinct spatial target. The demonstrator could look at the viewer with his eyes opened or closed and display different facial expressions. Unlike in humans, we found that direct gaze alone, devoid of an accompanying specific expression failed to influence the latency of the subsequent gaze-following response. However, when combined with threat, direct gaze significantly accelerated gaze-following. In a second experiment, we show that once turned away the expression associated with prior direct gaze no longer mattered; instead a submissive facial expression accompanying the gaze shift delayed gaze-following. Direct comparison of both experiments reveals that expressions accompanying direct gaze trigger earlier gaze-following responses than the same expressions joining gaze aversion. These results document the pronounced behavioral importance of the valuation of expressions signaling danger, arguably creating heightened alertness in monkey observers, thereby priming their gaze-following to allow for immediate conflict resolution."
"Multiplexed imaging is increasingly used to study tissue architecture in health and disease. To investigate the cancer tumor microenvironment, typically either tissue micro-arrays or small patient cohorts are used to collect and process data. However, studies performed over the course of years, collecting data from thousands of samples are rare and require specialized workflows to ensure sample throughput and reproducibility for data production and processing. Here, we present two such workflows for multiplexed immunofluorescence and imaging mass cytometry of cancer tissues which are applied to a total of roughly 10000 samples from 2500 patients over six years."
"Understanding biomolecular interactions is fundamental to advancing fields like drug discovery and protein design. In this paper, we introduce BO_SCPLOWOLTZC_SCPLOW-1, an open-source deep learning model incorporating innovations in model architecture, speed optimization, and data processing achieving AO_SCPLOWLPHAC_SCPLOWFO_SCPLOWOLDC_SCPLOW3-level accuracy in predicting the 3D structures of biomolecular complexes. BO_SCPLOWOLTZC_SCPLOW-1 demonstrates a performance on-par with state-of-the-art commercial models on a range of diverse benchmarks, setting a new benchmark for commercially accessible tools in structural biology. Further, we push the boundary of capabilities of these models with BO_SCPLOWOLTZC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP-C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWSTEERINGC_SCPLOW, a new inference time steering technique that is able to fix hallucinations and non-physical predictions from the models. By releasing the training and inference code, model weights, datasets, and benchmarks under the MIT open license, we aim to foster global collaboration, accelerate discoveries, and provide a robust platform for advancing biomolecular modeling."
"Sentinel animals may play a key role in surveillance of zoonotic arbovirus circulation, particularly in developing countries with low levels of investment in health. This study aimed to assess the relevance of using dogs as sentinel animals for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) surveillance in Madagascar.

Serological surveys were conducted on 513 dogs and 135 cattle in the Ifanadiana district. In addition, 486 human dry blood samples available from the same area were used. Serostatus against RVFV was determined using a competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (cELISA) for dog and cattle samples, and a Multiplex Bead Assay (MBA) for human samples. Serocatalytic models fitted to age-stratified serological data were developed to estimate the RVF force of infection (FOI) under several hypotheses, ranging from no relationship to proportional FOIs between humans, cattle, and dogs.

Antibodies to RVFV were detected in 23 of 513 dogs (4.5%; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): [2.9 - 6.7]), in 86 of 486 humans (17.7%; 95% CI: [14.4 - 21.4]), and in 33 of 135 cattle (24.4%; 95% CI: [17.5 - 32.6]). Based on the deviance information criterion, the best supported model indicated that FOI in humans and cattle was proportional to FOI in dogs. Proportionality parameters were estimated at 2.6 (95% credible interval (95% CrI): [1.4 - 5.1]) for humans and 3.5 (95% CrI: [1.3 - 6.4]) for cattle.

Our findings suggest that sampling dogs could be used to identify RVFV circulation in endemic areas, and infer the exposure of humans and cattle in these areas in Madagascar. This original result paves the way for an innovative surveillance method for RVFV in Madagascar and other endemic countries, but also for other arboviruses such as West Nile virus.

Author SummaryRift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis transmitted by mosquitoes and through contact with the blood, tissues or body fluids of infected animal. The disease has caused at least three major epidemics in Madagascar to date. RVF mainly affects ruminants through abortion and high mortality rate in young animals, and a range of influenza-like to more severe syndromes that can lead to death in some cases in humans. Dogs that interact with humans and are exposed to mosquito bites in the same environment may not develop clinical signs or sufficient viremia to infect vectors, but they could still develop an immune response when exposed to RVF virus (RVFV). This study aimed to assess the relevance of using dogs as sentinel animals for RVFV circulation on the island. Serocatalytic models were developed using serological data to represent and quantify the relationships between the force of infection (FOI) of RVFV exerted on dogs, humans and cattle. We found a proportional relationship between the FOI exerted on dogs and that exerted on humans and cattle. These findings support the relevance of using dogs as sentinel animals for monitoring the circulation of RVFV and arboviruses in general."
"Psilocybin is a hallucinogen with complex neurobiological and behavioral effects. This is the first study to use MRI to follow functional changes in brain activity in response to different doses of psilocybin in fully awake, drug naive rats. Female and male rats were given IP injections of vehicle or psilocybin in doses of 0.03 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, and 3.0 mg/kg while fully awake during the imaging session. Changes in BOLD signal were recorded over a 20 min window. Data for resting state functional connectivity were collected approximately 35 min post injection All data were registered to rat 3D MRI atlas with 173 brain regions providing site-specific changes in global brain activity and changes in functional connectivity. Treatment with psilocybin resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in positive BOLD signal. The areas most affected by the acute presentation of psilocybin were the somatosensory cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus. Females were significantly more sensitive to the 0.3 mg/kg dose of psilocybin than males. There was a significant dose-dependent global increase in functional connectivity, highlighted by hyperconnectivity to the cerebellum. Brain areas hypothesized to be involved in loss of sensory filtering and organization of sensory motor stimuli such as the claustrum and the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical loop were all affected by psilocybin in a dose-dependent manner. Indeed, the general neuroanatomical circuitry associated with the psychedelic experience was affected but the direction of the BOLD signal and pattern of activity between neural networks was inconsistent with the human literature."
"Spatial cellular profiling technologies have revolutionized our understanding of complex biological processes, from development and disease progression to immunity and aging. Despite their promise, integrating spatial information with multiplexed molecular data to accurately predict phenotypes poses significant challenges, especially in clinical settings. Here, we present SORBET, a geometric deep learning framework that directly analyzes complete spatial profiling data, eliminating the need to compress complete cell profiles into a limited set of annotations, such as cell types. SORBET models tissues as graphs of adjacent cells and applies graph convolutional networks to infer emergent phenotypes, such as responses to immunotherapy. The model leverages a novel data augmentation technique to ensure robust predictions, complemented by tailored interpretability analyses to identify the molecular and spatial patterns underlying the models phenotype inferences. We apply our method to a CosMx spatial transcriptomics dataset of pre-treatment metastatic melanoma samples annotated with response to immunotherapy; we show that spatial information significantly improves clinical endpoint, or phenotype, prediction and identifies important biological patterns. To our knowledge, SORBET is the first example of phenotype prediction on spatial transcriptomics data. We further validated our method using two spatial proteomics datasets, Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) and Co-detection by indexing (CODEX), obtained from Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Colorectal Cancer samples, respectively. SORBET demonstrates superior accuracy in phenotype prediction over leading spatial and non-spatial methods across various datasets of different observed phenotypes and technologies. SORBET sets a new benchmark for predictive analysis in spatial omics, promising to advance personalized medicine through refined patient treatment stratification, grounded in molecular and spatial tissue profiling."
"Sleep neurophysiology undergoes significant changes across the lifespan, which coincide with age-related differences in memory, particularly for emotional information. However, the mechanisms that underlie these effects remain poorly understood. One potential mechanism is the aperiodic component, which reflects ""neural noise"", differs across age, and is predictive of perceptual and cognitive processes. In this study, we investigated how intrinsic (i.e., resting-state) aperiodic neural activity modulates sleep-based emotional memory consolidation across the human lifespan. In a within-subjects, repeated measures design, forty-two participants aged 7 - 72 years (M = 26.60, SD = 17.45; 26 female) completed a learning and baseline recognition emotional memory task before a 2hr afternoon sleep opportunity and an equivalent period of wake. Recognition accuracy was also assessed post-delay. We found that aperiodic slopes follow a u-shaped trajectory across the lifespan: slopes flatten from childhood to young adulthood, before steepening thereafter, with this effect most prominent in frontal regions. Age-related differences in aperiodic slopes also explained interindividual differences in emotional memory consolidation, with less age-related flattening of slopes associated with stronger consolidation of negative stimuli post-sleep but not post-wake. Lastly, independent of aperiodic activity, age-related differences in NREM oscillatory activity predicted emotional memory consolidation. These findings suggest that the efficiency of sleep-based emotional memory consolidation is modulated by age-related differences in aperiodic neural and NREM oscillatory activities, providing novel insights into the neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning emotional memory across the lifespan."
"DNA hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplasia patients who are unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy. However, low response rates and therapy-resistant relapse remain significant challenges. To improve outcomes, we must understand how AML cells survive HMA treatment and continue to proliferate following therapy. We combine single-cell multiomics with parallel colony-forming assays to link HMA-induced heterogeneity with functional consequences in AML cellss. Azacytidine (AZA) and decitabine (DAC) induced global epigenetic heterogeneity, associated with upregulation of inflammatory responses and cell death pathways in a subset of hypomethylated cells. Some cells maintained high DNA methylation levels during treatment, and these methylation-retaining cells had increased self-renewal capacity following DAC treatment in two FLT3-ITD AML cell lines. Transcriptional profiling of colonies formed after HMA treatment revealed many genes with altered expression in both methylation-retaining and hypomethylated cells, with increased expression of cholesterol-related genes observed in all cell lines. Inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway by rosuvastatin enhanced HMA effects on colony formation in vitro and extended survival in two in vivo models of AML. Our study demonstrates that HMA-induced epigenetic heterogeneity has implications for AML cell growth and identifies statins as a candidate co-treatment strategy to improve HMA efficacy."
"Animals are sensitive to selective pressures associated with nutrient acquisition, underscoring the evolutionary significance of chemosensation in foraging and its intersection with satiety. For the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, isoamyl alcohol (3-methyl-1-butanol) and 2-methyl-1-butanol are produced by microbial fermentation and present in bacterial food sources collected from the natural environments. Both compounds, which are structural isomers of one another, elicit strong attraction in laboratory settings. Using laboratory chemotaxis assays, we show that starvation attenuates attraction to both compounds. Well-fed C. elegans is largely insensitive to the biosynthetic precursors of both alcohols, with the exception of 4-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, which is a mild repellent. C. elegans chemosensation relies on expression of tax-4 cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) and osm-9 transient receptor potential, vanilloid (TRPV) ion channels and animals lacking both genes are taste- and smell-blind. Animals lacking tax-4 fail to attract isoamyl alcohol and 2-methyl-1-butanol and those lacking osm-9 exhibit stronger attraction than the wild-type. Starvation not only attenuates attraction, but also enhances repulsion to 4-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid and uncovers repulsion in tax-4 mutants absent in their well-fed counterparts. Collectively, these findings implicate satiety in regulating response strength, tax-4-dependent chemotaxis in attraction to isoamyl alcohol and 2-methyl-1-butanol, and osm-9-dependent chemotaxis in suppressing responses to biosynthetic precursors."
"Host cells contest invasion by intracellular bacterial pathogens with multiple strategies that recognise and / or damage the bacterial surface. To identify novel host defence factors targeted to intracellular bacteria, we developed a versatile proximity biotinylation approach coupled to quantitative mass spectrometry that maps the host-bacterial interface during infection. Using this method, we discovered that intracellular Shigella and Salmonella become targeted by UFM1-protein ligase 1 (UFL1), an E3 ligase that catalyses the covalent attachment of Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1) to target substrates in a process called UFMylation. We show that Shigella antagonises UFMylation in a dual manner: first, using its lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to shield from UFL1 recruitment; second, preventing UFM1 decoration by the bacterial effector IpaH9.8. Absence of UFMylation leads to an increase of bacterial burden in both human cells and zebrafish larvae, suggesting that UFMylation is a highly conserved antibacterial pathway. Contrary to canonical ubiquitylation, the protective role of UFMylation is independent of autophagy. Altogether, our proximity mapping of the host-bacterial interface identifies UFMylation as an ancient antibacterial pathway and holds great promise to reveal other cell-autonomous immunity mechanisms."
"Eukaryotic genomes are spatially organized to regulate gene expression, and CTCF is a key architectural protein that links chromatin topology to transcriptional control. Accurate mapping of CTCF-DNA interactions is critical for understanding gene regulation.

However, conventional formaldehyde-based crosslinking in ChIP-seq biases towards long-lived protein-DNA interactions.

We substituted chemical crosslinking with ultraviolet (UV) laser crosslinking (UV ChIP-seq) to capture both stable and dynamic CTCF-DNA interactions in living K-562 cells.

UV ChIP-seq identified 38,706 CTCF binding sites, 70% of which were previously undetected by standard formaldehyde (FA) ChIP-seq. These UV-specific sites were enriched in active promoters, enhancers, and short-range chromatin loops, whereas formaldehyde ChIP-seq preferentially detected CTCF at topologically associated domain (TAD) boundaries and long-range loops. CTCF was detected at 85% of active transcription start sites, and when uniquely FA-identified sites were included, over 90% of active promoters were detected. De novo motif analysis also revealed noncanonical CTCF motifs at UV-specific sites, suggesting alternative binding configurations.

These results expand the CTCF cistrome, redefine its role in active chromatin, and underscore the need for complementary crosslinking strategies to characterize the full spectrum of transcription factor-DNA interactions."
"A role of the immune system in Parkinsons disease (PD) progression has long been suspected due to the increased frequency of activated glial cells and infiltrating T cells into the substantia nigra. It was previously reported that PD donors have increased T cell responses towards PINK1 and -synuclein (-syn), two Lewy body-associated proteins. Further, T cell reactivity towards -syn was highest closer to disease onset, highlighting that autoreactive T cells might play a role in PD pathogenesis. However, whether T cell autoreactivity is present during prodromal PD is unknown. Here, we investigated T cell responses towards PINK1 and -syn in donors at high risk of developing PD (i.e. prodromal PD: genetic risk, hyposmia, and or REM sleep behavior disorder), in comparison to PD and healthy control donors. T cell reactivity to these two autoantigens was detected in prodromal PD at levels comparable to those detected in individuals with clinically diagnosed PD. Aligned with the increased incidence of PD in males, we found that males with PD, but not females, had elevated T cell reactivity compared to healthy controls. However, among prodromal PD donors, males and females had elevated T cell responses. These differing trends in reactivity highlights the need for further studies of the impact of biological sex on neuroinflammation and PD progression."
"Genetic diagnosis is fast and cheap, challenging our capacity to evaluate the functional impact of novel disease-causing variants or identify potential therapeutics. Model organisms including C. elegans present the possibility of systematically modelling genetic diseases, yet robust, high-throughput methods have been lacking. Here we show that automated multi-dimensional behaviour tracking can detect phenotypes in 25 new C. elegans disease models spanning homozygous loss-of-function alleles and patient-specific single-amino-acid substitutions. We find that homozygous loss-of-function (LoF) mutants across diverse genetic pathways (including BORC, FLCN, and FNIP-2) exhibit strong, readily detectable abnormalities in posture, locomotion, and stimulus responses compared to wild-type animals. An smc-3 mutant strain--modelled by introducing a patient-identified missense change--causes developmental anomalies and distinct behavioural profiles even though complete loss of SMC-3 is lethal. In contrast, patient-derived missense mutations in another essential gene, tnpo-2, did not show a strong phenotype initially but it could be ""sensitized"" chemically (e.g., with aldicarb), potentially facilitating future drug screens. Our findings show that scalable behavioural phenotyping can capture a wide range of mutant effects--from strong to subtle--in patient-avatar worm lines. We anticipate that this standardized approach will enable systematic drug repurposing for rare genetic disorders as new disease variants are discovered."
"Germinal centres (GCs) are specialized structures where B cells undergo iterative steps of B-cell receptor (BCR) somatic hypermutation and selection of best antigen binders in a darwinian-like fashion. The accelerated evolutionary process leads to the production of high-affinity antibodies that are crucial for robust and long-term humoral immunity. Within this frame, single-cell BCR sequencing analysis is a method of choice to track GC B cell dynamics as somatic mutations can be utilised as an in vivo molecular tracer. Herein, we present SeQuoIA, a start-to-finish pipeline for the analysis of BCR repertoire sequencing data at the single-cell level, including improved clonotype assignment and phylogeny reconstruction. Most importantly, we introduce a new method for the inference of BCR-driven selection pressure based on somatic mutation patterns, that was validated with biological data. With this pipeline, we explored public datasets and proposed new selection mechanisms in GCs.

SignificanceOur pipeline should contribute to a better understanding of the basic biology of GC dynamics, and potentially help in laboratory animal usage reduction. Clinical applications could include assessment of vaccine efficacy, monitoring of B cell anti-tumoral responses, and identification of BCR-mediated processes in B cell lymphomas."
"The Sum of Single Effects (SuSiE) model, and a fitting procedure based on variational approximation, were recently introduced as a way to capture uncertainty in variable selection in multiple linear regression. This approach is particularly well-suited to cases where variables are highly correlated, and it has become quickly adopted for genetic fine-mapping studies. Here, we show that in small studies (< 50 samples) the original fitting procedure can produce substantially higher rates of false positive findings than it does in larger studies. We show that a simple alternative fitting procedure, which takes account of uncertainty in the residual variance, notably improves performance in small sample studies."
"The transport function of lymphatic vessels is altered during tissue injury, inflammation, and cancer. Defects in lymphatic function are associated with changes to the biophysical microenvironment, including pressure and flow. However, the ability of fluid forces to orchestrate the remodeling of blind-ended lymphatic vessels and lymphangiogenesis is not well understood. Here, we developed a novel microphysiological system (MPS) that recapitulates the blind-ended microanatomy and fluid absorption properties of capillary lymphatics. Our MPS implements a continuum of pressure-driven interstitial, transmural, and luminal flow to mimic fluid forces naturally present within the lymphatic microenvironment. We found that interstitial flow (IF) and VEGF-C cooperate during lymphangiogenesis. Notably, we observed that sprouting was most prominent at the blind-ended region of lymphatic vessels where transmural flow was highest in our MPS. Moreover, IF guided invading sprouts into the surrounding ECM antiparallel to streamlines within a non-uniform 3-D flow field. Strikingly, flow-induced elongation and axial alignment of intraluminal cells propagated to vessel-level phenotypic differences, such as vasoconstriction and helical patterning. The structural remodeling of these lymphatic vessels was concurrent with lymphangiogenesis. Thus, our results reveal how extravascular and intraluminal endothelial cells integrate signals from native fluid forces to coordinate the expansion and remodeling of capillary lymphatics."
"Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) exhibit substantial molecular and immune heterogeneity, complicating risk assessment and treatment. Here, we define three distinct transcriptional subtypes (C1, C2, C3) through integrative transcriptomic and immunogenomic profiling. C1 is characterized by hypoxia-driven pathways and an immunosuppressive microenvironment, correlating with poor prognosis. C2 exhibits a highly inflamed immune landscape with robust CD8+ T cell infiltration, suggesting potential sensitivity to immunotherapy. C3 is enriched in metabolic reprogramming pathways and displays intermediate clinical outcomes. Genetic analysis reveals subtype-specific mutational patterns, with pseudohypoxic driver mutations (SDHB, VHL, SDHA, SDHD) predominant in C1 and C3, while kinase pathway alterations (NF1, RET) define C2. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing further delineates immune ecosystem diversity. Notably, we identify ANGPT2, PCSK1N, and GPX3 as key subtype-specific biomarkers, with ANGPT2 driving tumor progression in C1 and emerging as a potential therapeutic target. Our findings provide a refined molecular classification integrating immune and genomic features, offering a framework for improved prognostication and precision therapies in PPGLs."
"The BraiDyn-BC (Brain Dynamics underlying emergence of Behavioral Change) Database offers an extensive, multimodal dataset that links wide-field calcium imaging of the mouse neocortex to comprehensive behavioral measurements during a behavioral task. As one of the contents in this database, we newly provide a dataset that includes 15 sessions spanning two weeks of motor skill learning, in which 25 mice were trained to pull a lever to obtain water rewards. Simultaneous high-speed videography captures body, facial, and eye movements, and environmental parameters are monitored. The dataset also features resting-state cortical activity and sensory-evoked responses, enhancing its utility for both learning-related and sensory-driven neural dynamics studies. Data are formatted in accordance with the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) standard, ensuring compatibility with existing analysis tools and adherence to the FAIR principles. This resource enables in-depth investigations into the neural mechanisms underlying behavior and learning. The platform encourages collaborative research, supporting the exploration of rapid within-session learning effects, long-term behavioral adaptations, and neural circuit dynamics."
"Mature neocortical pyramidal cells functionally express two sodium channel (NaV) isoforms: NaV1.2 and NaV1.6. These isoforms are differentially localized to pyramidal cell compartments, and as such are thought to contribute to different aspects of neuronal excitability. But determining their precise roles in pyramidal cell excitability has been hampered by a lack of tools that allow for selective, acute block of each isoform individually. Here, we leveraged aryl sulfonamide-based molecule (ASC) inhibitors of NaV channels that exhibit state-dependent block of both NaV1.2 and NaV1.6, along with knock-in mice with changes in NaV1.2 or NaV1.6 structure that prevents ASC binding. This allowed for acute, potent, and reversible block of individual isoforms that permitted dissection of the unique contributions of NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 in pyramidal cell excitability. Remarkably, block of each isoform had contrasting--and in some situations, opposing--effects on neuronal action potential output, with NaV1.6 block decreasing and NaV1.2 block increasing output. Thus, NaV isoforms have unique roles in regulating different aspects of pyramidal cell excitability, and our work may help guide development of therapeutics designed to temper hyperexcitability through selective NaV isoform blockade."
"Repeated use of methamphetamine (METH) is known to dysregulate the dopaminergic system and induce long-lasting changes in behavior, which may be influenced by sex and age of exposure. Catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) is an enzyme that is involved in the breakdown of catecholamines, and its role in dopamine clearance is thought to be especially important in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) where dopamine transporter (DAT) expression is relatively scarce. The first study in this report utilized a rat model to characterize the ontogeny of COMT protein expression in the PFC and nucleus accumbens (NAc) across adolescence, which is a developmental stage that has been shown to involve significant reorganization of dopaminergic innervation. Drug-naive male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed on postnatal day (P) 29, 39, 49 or 69, and expression levels of COMT protein within the PFC and NAc were analyzed via Western blot. We found that COMT expression in the PFC increases across adolescence in a sex-dependent manner but does not significantly change in the NAc during this timeframe. A separate group of rats were injected daily from P40-48 (adolescence) or P70-78 (adulthood) with saline or 3.0 mg/kg METH and sacrificed on P49 or P79. While METH decreased COMT in adult rats of both sexes, METH increased COMT expression in the PFC of rats exposed in adolescence. The results of this work suggest that exposure to METH during adolescence uniquely effects dopamine clearance within the PFC, potentially contributing to differences in neurobiological outcomes from METH use."
"Activation of the DNA damage checkpoint upon genotoxin treatment induces a multitude of cellular changes to cope with genome stress. After prolonged genotoxin treatment, the checkpoint can be downregulated to allow cell cycle and growth resumption. In yeast, downregulation of the DNA damage checkpoint requires the Srs2 DNA helicase, which removes the ssDNA binding complex RPA and the associated Mec1 checkpoint kinase from DNA, thus dampening Mec1-mediated checkpoint. However, it is unclear whether the  anti-checkpoint role of Srs2 is temporally and spatially regulated to allow timely checkpoint termination while preventing superfluous RPA removal. Here we address this question by examining regulatory elements of Srs2, such as its phosphorylation, sumoylation, and protein-interaction sites. Our genetic analyses and checkpoint level assessment suggest that the RPA countering role of Srs2 is promoted by Srs2 binding to PCNA, which recruits Srs2 to a subset of ssDNA containing regions. RPA antagonism is further fostered by Srs2 sumoylation, which we found depending on the Srs2-PCNA interaction and Mec1, and peaking after Mec1 activity reaches maximal levels. These data suggest that Srs2 recruitment to PCNA proximal ssDNA-RPA filaments followed by its sumoylation can promote checkpoint recovery, whereas Srs2 action is minimized at regions with no proximal PCNA to permit RPA-mediated ssDNA protection."
"Eggplant (Solanum melongena) research has been hindered by the lack of suitable model plants. The development of Micro-Mel and Mini-Mel, two short-cycle dwarf model lines with introgressions from the wild relative S. anguivi, represents a breakthrough in eggplant research. Both lines were characterized with 30 phenotypic descriptors and compared to their parental lines and the Micro-Tom tomato. Micro-Mel has determinate growth, early flowering (41.0 days post-transplantation), and physiological fruit maturity at 103.7 days. Mini-Mel exhibits indeterminate growth, later flowering (57.2 days) and fruit maturity (114.7 days), with a more conventional architecture. Micro-Mel and Mini-Mel complete 3.5 and 3.0 full seed-to-seed cycles per year, respectively. Their compact size makes them ideal for space-limited environments, controlled growth chambers, speed breeding, ornamental horticulture, and urban horticulture. To validate their potential for gene editing, in vitro regeneration experiments were performed on a medium containing zeatin riboside. Regeneration was similar to parental S. melongena (1.2 shoots/explant), with Micro-Mel developing 1.0 and Mini-Mel 0.8. Whole-genome sequencing (23X coverage) identified 179,653 SNPs between the parental lines, revealing heterozygosity rates of 0.00098% for Micro-Mel and 0.00123% in Mini-Mel. Approximately 8.50% and 10.79% of their genomes were introgressed from S. anguivi, respectively. Analysis identified 18 shared introgressions from S. anguivi among Micro-Mel, Mini-Mel, and four backcross dwarf materials derived from the same original plant. Notably, three orthologues of genes associated with dwarfism in tomato (SlDREB1, SlER, and SlSERK1) were identified within these introgressions. Micro-Mel and Mini-Mel represent transformative tools for eggplant research, accelerating genetic, physiological, and breeding studies."
"A primary goal of systems neuroscience is to discover how ensembles of neurons transform inputs into goal-directed behavior, a process known as neural computation. A powerful framework for understanding neural computation uses neural dynamics - the rules that describe the temporal evolution of neural activity - to explain how goal-directed input-output transformations occur. As dynamical rules are not directly observable, we need computational models that can infer neural dynamics from recorded neural activity. We typically validate such models using synthetic datasets with known ground-truth dynamics, but unfortunately existing synthetic datasets dont reflect fundamental features of neural computation and are thus poor proxies for neural systems. Further, the field lacks validated metrics for quantifying the accuracy of the dynamics inferred by models. The Computation-through-Dynamics Benchmark (CtDB) fills these critical gaps by providing: 1) synthetic datasets that reflect computational properties of biological neural circuits, 2) interpretable metrics for quantifying model performance, and 3) a standardized pipeline for training and evaluating models with or without known external inputs. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how CtDB can help guide the development, tuning, and troubleshooting of neural dynamics models. In summary, CtDB provides a critical platform for model developers to better understand and characterize neural computation through the lens of dynamics."
"Cellular differentiation processes are largely orchestrated by variation in transcription factor (TF) abundance. Since these proteins are usually expressed at extremely low levels, studying TF-driven cellular processes using single-cell proteomics by mass spectrometry (scp-MS) has been challenging. Here we present informed DIA (iDIA), an acquisition method tailored towards low-input and scp-MS. iDIA combines targeted and global proteomics in a single acquisition scheme and is by design universally applicable on different MS instrumentation. By combining wide window (ww)PRM scans with DIA acquisition, we observed a median 4-fold improvement in limit of quantification with targeted acquisitions, while maintaining biologically meaningful global proteome coverage. We utilize this gained sensitivity to quantify TFs in single murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and showcase their lineage-specific regulation."
"Cethromycin combines a quinoline nucleus and a macrolide for broad spectrum antibacterial and antiprotozoan activity. Here we characterized the murine pharmacokinetics and Plasmodium berghei lifecycle stage pharmacodynamics for the cethromycin base. Liver pharmacokinetic studies in mice show peak mM drug levels in the liver with 20 hour sustained levels above 10 M. Peak concentrations in the liver were double the lung and about 440 times that of plasma. Immunofluorescence imaging of in vitro cethromycin-treated infected hepatocytes shows complete ablation of the apicoplast. We observed complete cure of P. berghei liver stage infection by single oral dose of 60 mg/kg in mice which is equivalent to the 5 mg/kg human dose of 300 mg a day used in bacterial pneumonia studies. Cethromycin at 60 mg/kg daily for 7 days was curative in the high parasitemic P. berghei mouse model. Both mosquito membrane feeding of P. falciparum gametocytes incubated with 20 M cethromycin and oral dosing in mice demonstrated no decrease in oocyst numbers. Cethromycin has been evaluated for efficacy against bacterial pneumonia in more than 5,000 patients with good safety profiles. Cethromycin has potential for rapid clinical development for casual malaria prophylaxis and possibly radical cure of dormant liver P. vivax."
"Oral Langerhans cells (LCs) are well recognized for their immunological roles, but their involvement in other physiological processes remains poorly understood. This study identifies a novel function of oral LCs in regulating tongue epithelial innervation. Postnatal LC development coincides with the establishment of local innervation, and LC depletion impairs innervation and alters nociceptive responses, underscoring their neuroimmune function. This function is driven by LC-derived IL-1{beta}, which stimulates basal epithelial cells to produce nerve growth factor (NGF), thereby promoting sensory nerve growth. Transcriptomic analyses revealed neuronal-related pathways enriched in LCs. Aging reduces LC frequency, NGF expression, and epithelial innervation, linking neuroimmune regulation to epithelial aging. While LC frequencies in the tongue remain unaffected in germ-free mice, the microbiota is essential for optimal LC function and NGF production. These findings expand our understanding of oral LCs, revealing their pivotal role in epithelial innervation beyond immune surveillance."
"Transcription-replication conflicts frequently occur at repetitive DNA elements involved in genome maintenance functions. The KSHV terminal repeats (TR) function as the viral episome maintenance element when bound by the viral encoded nuclear antigen LANA. Here, we show that transcription-replication conflicts occur at or near LANA binding sites in the TR. We show by proximity ligation assay (PLA) that PCNA and RNAPII colocalize with LANA-nuclear bodies (LANA-NBs). Using DNA-RNA-IP (DRIP) assays with S9.6 antibody, we demonstrate that R-loops form at the TR. We find that these R-loops are also associated with histone H3pS10 a marker for R-loops associated with transcription-replication conflicts. Inhibitors of RNA polymerase eliminated LANA binding to the TR, along with the loss of R-loops and activation associated histone modifications, and the accumulation of heterochromatic marks. We show that LANA can induce all of these features on a plasmid containing 8, but not 2 copies of the TR, correlating strongly with episome maintenance function. Taken together, our study indicates that LANA induces histone modifications associated with RNA and DNA polymerase activity and the formation of R-loops that correlate with episome maintenance function. These findings provide new insights into mechanisms of KSHV episome maintenance during latency and more generally for genome maintenance of repetitive DNA.

ImportanceKSHV latent infection is responsible for Kaposis Sarcoma (KS) and Pleural Effusion Lymphoma (PEL). KSHV latency and persistence depends on LANA binding to the terminal repeats (TR). We show that LANA binding promotes the formation of R-loops associated with transcription-replication conflicts and histone H3pS10 at the KSHV terminal repeats. These epigenetic features depend on active RNA polymerase at the TR and correlate strongly with KSHV episome maintenance function. The findings suggest a novel mechanism of chromatin structural maintenance dependent on LANA binding at the TR during KSHV latency."
"Through the end of the century, biodiversity is expected to markedly decline around the world due to climate change, habitat loss, and other factors. Because of this, there is an increasing need for more efficient, effective, and collaborative conservation efforts worldwide. While many global and national threat assessment databases exist, they may only have limited utility at regional and local scales where on-the-ground conservation is best implemented. To better identify species risk at a more regional scale, the 14 state fish and wildlife agencies in the northeastern United States worked with taxonomic experts across the Northeast to create the most recent (2023) list of Regional Species of Greatest Conservation Need (RSGCN). We compared a preliminary list compiled from global and national datasets to the finalized list after the process documented here. We found that the global and national datasets only identified ~55% of the 806 species statuses accurately for the region, demonstrating the importance of current local and regional expertise and data. The process of identifying RSGCN for the northeastern U.S. has resulted in specific actionable information leading to beneficial outcomes, such as dedicated funding for regional initiatives, data-sharing, and coordination among regional, state, and local conservation organizations - enabling beneficial conservation outcomes across the region for many of the species and habitats of the region. The methods described may serve as a framework for other regions to help identify conservation targets using the best available and more localized landscape- and watershed-scale information."
"Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a bloodborne virus that affects 57 million people globally with infections that can often go unnoticed, and it is the leading cause of chronic liver disease and cancer. Thus, development of an HCV vaccine is a major medical and public health concern. While prior work has developed secreted E1E2 (sE1E2) protein vaccine candidates, efforts to express it recombinantly in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have resulted in very low titers. To address this challenge, here we employed a multi-omics approach to identify protein interactors that enhance the secretion of sE1E2. By detecting Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) using Biotinylation by Antibody Recognition (BAR) and integrating the data with RNA-Seq, we identified proteins within the secretory pathway that interact with sE1E2 and validated their impact by overexpressing the interacting proteins. Among these, CUL4A and YWHAH enhanced sE1E2 secretion in glycoengineered CHO (geCHO) cells. The integration of omics techniques and genetic engineering in this study provides valuable insights into improving protein secretion in CHO cells, paving the way for the development of more affordable and accessible biotherapeutics."
"Mitochondrial function critically dependents on protein quality control systems, with the m-AAA protease plays a key role at the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). The evolutionarily conserved prohibitins (PHBs) are essential modulators of this protease across species, yet the molecular mechanisms remain unclear.

Here, we present the Cryo-EM structure of the Chaetomium thermophilum PHB (CtPHB) complex, revealing a cage-like assembly composed of 11 copies of PHB1/PHB2 heterodimers. Electron microscopic and biochemical analyses suggest that m-AAA proteases are enclosed within the PHB complex through interactions mediated by their SPFH-interacting motif (SIM) exposed in the intermembrane space. Further in situ cryo-ET directly visualizes these cage-protease assemblies in native mitochondria. Disruption of their interface leads to elevated m-AAA protease activity and diminished mitochondrial stress resistance. These data establish PHB complexes as spatial organizers that compartmentalize m-AAA proteases in membrane microdomains to fine tune proteolytic homeostasis.

Our findings reveal the critical role of the PHB complex in maintaining mitochondrial proteostasis, providing a unified mechanistic model to explain and reconcile the pleiotropic, and often contradictive phenotypes of PHBs and m-AAA protease in mitochondrial physiology and various disease conditions."
"Adaptive evolution often leads to niche specialization, but successful colonization of a new niche can depend as much on ecological context as on genetic change. This is especially true in spatially structured environments, where the physical construction of habitat and the order of arrival of mutants can shape evolutionary outcomes. In static broth cultures, the air-liquid interface (ALI) provides a high-oxygen niche typically colonized by mat-forming mutants. In Pseudomonas fluorescens, a range of single mutations that upregulate cellulose production give rise to ""wrinkly spreader"" (WS) types--canonical niche specialists that out-compete ancestral types at the ALI. Yet we discover that this is a half-truth: WS mutants frequently fail to establish when introduced alone at low density, but co-culture with ancestral types rescues colonization. Microscopy and model simulations show that ancestors physically scaffold the ALI, enabling stable attachment and facilitating the in situ emergence of an array of genetically diverse WS mutants. Ancestors later disperse, vacate the niche and allow WS mutant expansion. This transient asymmetric interaction reveals that even strongly adaptive mutations may require ecological facilitation to succeed. More broadly, our findings challenge simple narratives of adaptive replacement and underscore how transient ecological dependencies can shape the trajectory of evolutionary change."
"Concerns over the replicability and reproducibility of published research have grown in many research fields, but empirical data to inform policies are still scarce. Biomedical research in Brazil expanded rapidly over the last three decades, with no systematic assessment of the replicability of its findings. With this in mind, we set up the Brazilian Reproducibility Initiative, a multicenter replication of published experiments from Brazilian science using three common experimental methods: the MTT assay, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the elevated plus maze (EPM). A total of 56 laboratories performed 143 replications of 56 experiments; of these, 96 replications of 47 experiments were considered valid by an independent committee. Replication rates for these experiments varied between 15 and 45% according to five predefined criteria. In median terms, relative effect sizes were 60% larger in original experiments than in replications, while coefficients of variation were 60% smaller. Effect size decrease was smaller for MTT, cell line experiments and original results with less variability, while t values for replications were positively correlated with researcher predictions about replicability. Deviations from preregistered protocols were very common in replications, most frequently due to reasons inherent to the experimental model or related to infrastructure and logistics. Our results highlight factors that limit the replicability of results published by researchers in Brazil and suggest ways by which this scenario can be improved."
"Macrocycles are a promising therapeutic class. The incorporation of heterochiral and non-natural chemical building-blocks presents challenges for rational design, however. With no existing machine learning methods tailored for heterochiral macrocycle design, we developed a novel convolutional autoencoder model to rapidly generate energetically favorable macrocycle backbones for heterochiral design and structure prediction. Our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art method, Generalized Kinematic loop closure (GenKIC) in the Rosetta software suite. Given the absence of large, available macrocycle datasets, we created a custom dataset in-house and in silico. Our model, CyclicCAE, produces energetically stable backbones and designable structures more rapidly than GenKIC. It enables users to perform energy minimization, generate structurally similar or diverse inputs via MCMC, and conduct inpainting with fixed anchors or motifs. We propose that this novel method will accelerate the development of stable macrocycles, speeding up macrocycle drug design pipelines."
"Genetic variation that influences complex disease susceptibility is introduced into the population by mutation and removed by natural selection and genetic drift. This mutation-selection-drift-balance (MSDB) shapes the prevalence of a disease and its genetic architecture. To date, however, MSDB has only been modeled for monogenic (Mendelian) diseases. Here, we develop a MSDB model for complex disease susceptibility: we assume that genotype relates to disease risk according to the canonical liability threshold model and that selection on variants affecting risk derives from the fitness cost of the disease, and focus on diseases that are highly polygenic, entail a substantial fitness cost, and are neither extremely common in the population nor exceedingly rare. Contrasting model predictions with GWAS and other findings in humans suggests that directional selection plays little role in shaping common genetic variation affecting complex disease susceptibility but might substantially affect rare, large effect variation. In turn, common variation affecting complex disease susceptibility appears to be dominated by pleiotropic stabilizing selection on other traits. Our results further suggest that current estimates of disease heritability are likely biased. More generally, our model provides a better understanding of the evolutionary processes that shape the architecture and prevalence of complex diseases."
"The use of antibiotics disrupts the gut microbiota, potentially leading to long-term health issues and the spread of resistance. To investigate the impact of antibiotics on phage populations, we followed 22 healthy individuals two weeks before and up to six months after a three-day course of 3rd-generation cephalosporins. The populations of phages very rarely encoded antibiotic resistance genes and were mostly temperate including many phage-plasmids. Gut phages remained individual-specific even after microbiome perturbation by antibiotics. Yet, we found a 20% decline in phage diversity the day after treatment, alongside blooms of a few (mostly virulent) phages. We suggest that these temporary dominant phages contribute to the recovery of gut bacterial diversity through kill-the-winner dynamics. This is supported by the finding that several phages targeted Parabacteroides distasonis, a bacterium thriving after cephalosporin treatment, and which only proliferated when these phages were absent.Our findings suggest that phages play a crucial role in the gut microbiotas response to antibiotics by contributing to the restoration of microbial balance and diversity.

HighlightsO_LIIn healthy individuals, cephalosporin antibiotics cause an approx. 20% decline in gut phage richness that is restored after 30 days
C_LIO_LIHuman gut phage communities are specific of each individual, which is retained post-antibiotic treatment
C_LIO_LIAntibiotic perturbation causes an increase in the number of dominant virulent phages supporting kill-the-winner dynamics as mechanisms for shaping bacterial diversity
C_LIO_LIDominance of Parabacteroides distasonis (after cephalosporin treatment) is likely disrupted through its specific phages
C_LI

eTOCAntibiotic-induced disruption of the gut microbiome leads to a transient loss of microbiome diversity (bacterial and viral) and causes blooms of bacteria and their viruses. Our analysis suggests that these viruses prey on dominant bacteria, prevent their dominance, and contribute to the recovery of microbiome balance.

"Proteases regulate important biological functions. Here we present the structural and functional characterization of three previously uncharacterized aspartic proteases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that these proteases have structural hallmarks of retropepsin peptidases and play redundant roles for cell survival under hypoosmotic stress conditions. Consequently, we named them retropepsin-like osmotic stress tolerance peptidases (Rlo). Our research shows that while Rlo proteases are homologous to RimB, an aspartic peptidase involved in rhizosphere colonization and plant infection, they contain N-terminal signal peptides and perform distinct biological functions. Mutants lacking all three secreted Rlo peptidases show defects in antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, and cell morphology. These defects are rescued by mutations in the inactive transglutaminase transmembrane protein RloB and the cytoplasmic ATP-grasp protein RloC, two previously uncharacterized genes in the same operon as one of the Rlo proteases. These studies identify Rlo proteases and rlo operon products as critical factors in clinically relevant processes, making them appealing targets for therapeutic strategies against Pseudomonas infections.

IMPORTANCEBacterial infections have become harder to treat due to the ability of pathogens to adapt to different environments and the rise of antimicrobial resistance. This has led to longer illnesses, increased medical costs, and higher mortality rates. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is particularly problematic because of its inherent resistance to many antibiotics and its capacity to form biofilms, structures that allow bacteria to withstand hostile conditions. Our study uncovers a new class of retropepsin-like proteases in P. aeruginosa that are required for biofilm formation and bacterial survival upon stress conditions, including antibiotic exposure. By identifying critical factors that determine bacterial fitness and adaptability, our research lays the foundation for developing new therapeutic strategies against bacterial infections."
"Discovery of therapeutic antibodies against infectious disease pathogens presents distinct challenges. Ideal candidates must possess not only the properties required for any therapeutic antibody (e.g. specificity, low immunogenicity) but also high affinity to many mutants of the target antigen. Here we present RESP2, an enhanced version of our RESP pipeline, designed for the discovery of antibodies against one or multiple antigens with simultaneously optimized developability properties. We first evaluate this pipeline in silico using the Absolut! database of scores for antibodies docked to target antigens. We show that RESP2 consistently identifies sequences that bind more tightly to a group of target antigens than any sequence present in the training set with success rates >= 85%. Popular generative AI techniques evaluated on the same datasets achieve success rates of 1.5% or less by comparison. Next we use the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the COVID-19 spike protein as a case study, and discover a highly human antibody with broad (mid to high-affinity) binding to at least 8 different variants of the RBD. These results illustrate the advantages of this pipeline for antibody discovery against a challenging target. A Python package that enables users to utilize the RESP pipeline on their own targets is available at https://github.com/Wang-lab-UCSD/RESP2, together with code needed to reproduce the experiments in this paper."
"The apoplast is a critical interface in plant-pathogen interactions particularly in the context of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), which is initiated by recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Our study characterizes the proteomic profile of the Arabidopsis apoplast during PTI induced by flg22, a 22 amino acid bacterial flagellin epitope, to elucidate the output of PTI. Apoplastic washing fluid (AWF) was extracted with minimal cytoplasmic contamination for LC-MS/MS analysis. We observed consistent identification of PTI enriched and depleted peptides across replicates with limited correlation between total protein abundance and transcript abundance. We observed topological bias in peptide recovery of receptor-like kinases with peptides predominantly recovered from their ectodomains. Notably, tetraspanin 8, an exosome marker, was enriched in PTI samples. We additionally confirmed increased concentrations of exosomes during PTI. This study enhances our understanding of the proteomic changes in the apoplast during plant immune responses and lays the groundwork for future investigations into the molecular mechanisms of plant defense under recognition of pathogen molecular patterns."
"Thyroid cancer presents significant diagnostic challenges due to its complex anatomy and diverse tissue types. This study leverages Dynamic Optical Contrast Imaging (DOCI), a label-free, real-time imaging technology, with machine learning to enhance tumor detection and segmentation. Using 23 DOCI filters, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) for classification, and U-Net models for segmentation. The approach achieved high accuracy in distinguishing tissue types, with PCA enabling clear clustering, k-NN classifying normal, follicular, and papillary tissues, and U-Net models achieving 96.34% and 92.02% accuracy for papillary and follicular segmentation, respectively. Filter importance analysis reduced input dimensionality without significantly compromising performance, highlighting the potential for optimized imaging protocols. These findings demonstrate DOCIs utility in improving diagnostic accuracy and tumor characterization in thyroid cancer and beyond, offering a foundation for personalized treatment planning and surgical precision."
"Primary afferent neurons detect sensory stimuli in the periphery and transmit this information to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where it is extensively processed by excitatory and inhibitory spinal controls before being sent to higher brain centres. Immunohistochemical analysis of the synaptic architecture of these spinal circuits has been notoriously difficult in formaldehyde-fixed tissue and often requires antigen retrieval techniques to reveal antigen binding epitopes. To avoid the damage this harsh treatment can induce, studies have used antibodies raised against scaffolding proteins Homer1 and gephyrin, which anchor glutamate and GABA receptors to the membrane, respectively, to identify synaptic associations in rodent spinal cord underlying pain and itch transmission. In contrast, few studies have attempted to visualise spinal cord synapses in the human, partly due to a lack of high-quality tissue with low postmortem intervals. In this study, we reveal both excitatory and inhibitory synapses at a high resolution in human lumbar spinal cord tissue using antibodies to Homer1 and gephyrin and show that the basic organisation of these proteins within the dorsal horn is similar to that seen in the rodent. We show these postsynaptic markers are highly colocalised with glutamate and GABA receptor subunits and are in close apposition to presynaptic markers, confirming their specificity. Finally, we use Homer1-immunolabelling to demonstrate that primary afferents can form complex synaptic arrangements in human. We conclude that these antibodies can be used as reliable tools for the study of the human CNS and we have used them to reveal insight into the microanatomy of somatosensory connections in the human spinal cord that can be expanded upon in future studies."
"Intracranial electrophysiology offers a unique insight into the nature of information representation in the brain - it can be used to disentangle information encoded in local neuronal activity (gamma and high gamma frequencies) from information encoded via long-range interactions (lower frequencies). We used regularised logistic regression to decode animacy from time-frequency power and phase extracted from electrocorticography (ECoG) grid electrode data recorded on the surface of human vATL. Power in gamma (30 - 60 Hz) and high gamma (60 - 200 Hz) produced reliable decoding, indicating that semantic information is indeed expressed by local populations in vATL. However, power from a wide range of frequencies (4 - 200 Hz) produced significantly higher decoding accuracy and also exhibited the same rapidly-changing dynamic code previously observed when decoding voltage. These findings support the theory that semantic information is encoded by a local vATL ""hub"" that interacts with distributed cortical ""spokes""."
"Breeding for quantitative, polygenic resistance is widely considered the most durable, cost-effective, and environmentally safe approach to crop disease control. However, progress in resistance breeding is hindered by the limited capability of current approaches to measure highly quantitative disease phenotypes under field conditions with high precision and sufficient throughput.

Here, we present an imaging protocol and a modular image processing pipeline that enables wheat disease detection and severity estimation directly from very-high-resolution canopy imagery, eliminating the need for physical interaction with the monitored plants as required in previously proposed sensor-based methods capable of symptom-level diagnosis. The pipeline combines deep-learning-based semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, and depth estimation to diagnose and quantify disease symptoms and extract the analyzable reference plant surfaces for severity estimation. By leveraging estimated relative depth and analyzing image texture, well-focused areas with sufficient quality were accurately segmented. Despite the challenging nature of canopy images and frequent symptom ambiguity, symptom detection and segmentation models trained on a new dataset reached a similar performance as already described in more simplified scenarios where detached, flattened leaves were analyzed.

Plot-level severity estimates of Septoria Tritici Blotch, a major wheat disease, obtained using the new method and a precise but more laborious reference method were highly correlated (Pearson R = 0.83) across a range of morphologically contrasting cultivars. Validation of the new method on data collected by different operators at different sites demonstrated the robustness of the approach. The ability of the method to process imagery acquired in a contact-free manner can enable deployment on autonomous ground vehicles, paving the way for automated, scalable phenotype acquisition."
"Free-living amoebae (FLA) are ubiquitous and can be found in many types of environments including soil, freshwater, air and marine environments. They feed on various microorganisms and can play an important role in the food web and its dynamics. We previously described that FLAs belonging to the Vannella genus from the oyster farming area of the Thau lagoon in France could establish stable interactions with Vibrionaceae and could play a role in the selection of some virulence factors, potentially influencing pathogen dynamics. To further investigate the ecological interactions between FLA populations and Vibrionaceae in Mediterranean coastal waters, we conducted monthly sampling for one year at three contrasting sites. Free-living amoebae populations were isolated by culturing water and sediment samples on different bacterial lawns, including E. coli or V. tasmaniensis, V. crassostreae and V. harveyi. Amoebozoan diversity was analyzed using v4-18S barcoding and revealed distinct communities between the sediment and the water column, with Vannellidae significantly enriched in the water column whereas Paramoebidae were significantly enriched in the sediments. Selection of grazers on different bacterial lawns revealed that V. tasmaniensis inhibited the growth of most Vannellidae, whereas V. crassostreae inhibited the growth of a large proportion of Paramoebidae. These differences were further confirmed in functional grazing assays using isolates belonging to each Amoebozoa taxonomic group. Overall, our results highlight the need for more comprehensive studies of the diversity and population dynamics of Amoebozoa in marine environments, and that the role of these diversified grazers in shaping vibrio communities is complex and still poorly characterized."
"Hydrogel-based three-dimensional (3D) co-culture systems are emerging as biomimetic platforms that more accurately recapitulate tissue architecture and microenvironmental interactions compared to conventional two-dimensional (2D) cultures. This study introduces an engineered 3D liver-like model to investigate compartment-specific responses to the potent hepatocarcinogen Diethylnitrosamine (DEN), with a focus on early events in carcinogenesis and tumor-stroma interactions. AML12 and 3T3 cell lines were treated with DEN or vehicle either in 2D culture or in 3D hydrogels in four experimental groups: (1) DEN-treated AML12 with vehicle-treated 3T3, (2) DEN-treated 3T3 with vehicle-treated AML12, (3) both cell types DEN-treated, and (4) both vehicle-treated. The cultured recombinants were subjected to proteomic profiling via mass spectrometry, followed by bioinformatics analysis and the results were validated through immunocytochemical staining (ICC). Gene ontology analysis revealed that cytoskeletal, RNA metabolism, and scaffold/adaptor proteins were among the most significantly enriched in 3D versus 2D models. Structural proteins emerged exclusively in mixed 3D co-cultures, reinforcing the organotypic nature of the system. Enriched pathways in 3D included intermediate filament organization, actin dynamics, and focal adhesion--pathways closely associated with liver carcinogenesis. Protein-protein interaction analysis demonstrated maximal network complexity in 3D cultures where both compartments were DEN-exposed. Survival analysis further identified poor-prognosis biomarkers (KRT20, KRT15, KRT14) uniquely enriched in this condition. ICC staining supported the proteomic findings. This organoid-like 3D co-culture model provides a physiologically relevant platform for investigating early-stage liver carcinogenesis and highlights the critical role of stromal-epithelial interactions. Its ability to replicate organ-level complexity and generate clinically relevant proteomic signatures supports its utility in translational cancer research and future drug discovery applications."
"Dementia is associated with altered resting state connectivity, measures of which could aid in its early detection and monitoring. High-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) is well-suited to detect these alterations at scale due to its numerous practical advantages, but it has not yet been applied to dementia. In this study, we investigated resting state functional connectivity across the prefrontal cortex in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI, n = 22), Alzheimers Disease (AD, n = 21), and in healthy controls (n = 22). A graph theoretical approach was taken to characterise both global and local patterns of connectivity over a five-minute resting period. We found that individuals with AD and MCI exhibited denser and stronger networks, with shorter path lengths, as well as a loss of consistent key network hubs with worsening cognitive impairment. These results indicate that networks in dementia are more globally connected, albeit in a disorganised manner, perhaps reflecting the recruitment of additional connections for short-term stability which may be ultimately damaging in the long-term. Following the demonstration of HD-DOTs capacity to detect differences between healthy ageing and dementia, this work opens up new possibilities for the use of optical imaging in the study of this clinical population and HD-DOTs potential for scalable clinical use."
"Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is a key regulator of chromatin architecture and transcriptional repression, playing essential roles in development and disease. While its enzymatic activity is well characterized, the molecular factors governing PRC2 subnuclear organization, particularly in cancer cells, are largely unknown. Here, we integrate high-resolution in situ spatial proteomics, imaging, and functional genomics to investigate PRC2 compartmentalization in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. We identify PHF19, a sub-stoichiometric PRC2 accessory subunit upregulated in TNBC, as a key factor driving the formation of micron-sized nuclear PRC2 bodies. These structures act as functional hubs that stabilize PRC2 occupancy and reinforce H3K27me3 domain organization. Mechanistically, we identify an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) within PHF19 that is essential for its clustering behavior in cells and link this property to the role of PHF19 in promoting cancer cell motility. Our findings uncover a non-enzymatic layer of PRC2 regulation, whereby its local compartmentalization through accessory subunits directly impinges on cellular behavior. These insights expand our understanding of PRC2 spatial biology with implications for both normal development and disease progression."
"The distribution of sugars is crucial for plant energy, signaling, and defense mechanisms. Sugar Transport Proteins (STPs) are Sugar Porters that mediate proton-driven cellular uptake of glucose. Some STPs also transport fructose, while others remain highly selective for only glucose. What determines this selectivity, allowing STPs to distinguish between compounds with highly similar chemical composition, remains unknown. Here, we present the structure of Arabidopsis thaliana STP6 in an inward occluded conformational state with glucose bound and demonstrate its role as both a glucose and fructose transporter. We perform a comparative analysis of STP6 with the glucose-selective STP10 using in-vivo and in-vitro systems, demonstrating how different experimental setups strongly influence kinetic transport properties. We analyze the properties of the monosaccharide binding site and show that the position of a single methyl group in the binding site is sufficient to shuffle glucose and fructose specificity, providing detailed insights into the fine-tuned dynamics of affinity-induced specificity for sugar uptake. Altogether these findings enhance our understanding of sugar selectivity in STPs and more broadly Sugar Porter proteins.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTUnderstanding the mechanisms of sugar transport in plants is essential for advancing agricultural practices and enhancing plant resilience. This study reveals the structural basis of sugar selectivity in Sugar Transport Proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana. By comparing the dual-specific STP6, transporting both glucose and fructose with the glucose-selective STP10 across multiple experimental setups, we show that difference as subtle as the position of a single methyl group in the binding site can control sugar specificity. These findings enhance our understanding of sugar selectivity by Sugar Transport Proteins and more broadly Sugar Porter proteins and lay the groundwork for engineering crops with improved energy efficiency and pathogen resistance."
"Parkinsons disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurodegenerative disease in the world1. Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction can occur decades before motor impairments and in up to 80% of individuals living with PD2,3,4. We investigated peripheral relationships that may underlie mechanisms along the gut-blood axis that contribute to PD pathogenesis. Single-cell multiomic spatial molecular imaging (SMI) of colonic tissue localized inflammatory injury within epithelial cells that appear to be associated with iron mishandling in both inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and PD biosamples. We found that both the single-cell SMI of RNA and protein revealed parallel cross-modal dysregulation in the gut epithelium, in both IBD and PD biosamples. These data are accompanied by plasma (PD) and stool (IBD) protein depletion of CCL22. Our findings suggest iron mishandling along the gut barrier likely contributes to systemic inflammation, which may be the catalyst that primes circulating immune cells to body-first PD pathogenesis."
"We seek to establish a parsimonious mathematical framework for understanding the interaction and dynamics of the response of pancreatic cancer to the NGC triple chemotherapy regimen (mNab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and cisplatin), stromal-targeting drugs (calcipotriol and losartan), and an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1). We developed a set of ordinary differential equations describing changes in tumor size (growth and regression) under the influence of five cocktails of treatments. Model calibration relies on three tumor volume measurements obtained over a 14-day period in a genetically engineered pancreatic cancer model (KrasLSLG12D-Trp53LSLR172H-Pdx1-Cre). Our model reproduces tumor growth in the control and treatment scenarios with an average concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.99{+/-}0.01. We conduct leave-one-out predictions (average CCC=0.74{+/-}0.06), mouse-specific predictions (average CCC=0.75{+/-}0.02), and hybrid, group-informed, mouse-specific predictions (average CCC=0.85{+/-}0.04). The developed mathematical model demonstrates high accuracy in fitting the experimental tumor data and a robust ability to predict tumor response to treatment. This approach has important implications for optimizing combination NGC treatment strategies."
"Fungal secondary metabolites exhibit remarkable chemical diversity and biological activity, making them valuable sources of bioactive compounds. A group of polyketides, with a similar core structure, have been isolated previously from different fungi - the phytotoxins diaporthin and orthosporin, the mediocre antimicrobial dichlorodiaporthin, as well as diaporthinol and diaporthinic acid. Previous studies in Aspergillus oryzae suggest that diaporthin and orthosporin originate from a different biosynthetic gene cluster than dichlorodiaporthin, while the biosynthetic routes for diaporthinic acid and diaporthinol have not yet been identified.

In this study, we successfully activated the dia biosynthetic gene cluster in Trichoderma reesei via transcription factor overexpression, leading to the identification of diaporthinic acid as the primary metabolite. Structural elucidation using NMR confirmed its identity, while bioactivity assays revealed no significant antimicrobial effects. Further, diaporthin, orthosporin, dichlorodiaporthin, and diaporthinol, as well as an isomer of alternariol were attributed to the same cluster. Gene deletion experiments demonstrated that Dia1, Dia4, and Dia5 are essential for diaporthinic acid biosynthesis, with Dia4 likely catalyzing the oxidation of dichlorodiaporthin yielding diaporthinic acid. Dia2 and Dia3 were found to be dispensable, challenging previous in vitro findings for the biosynthesis of dichlorodiaporthin. These findings provide new insights into the biosynthetic network of the dia BGC, expanding our understanding of natural product biosynthesis in filamentous fungi."
"The human gut microbiota exhibits significant diversity across populations, influenced by factors such as geography, diet, and lifestyle, particularly between the Han Chinese and non-Chinese populations. While previous studies have predominantly focused on the taxonomic abundance of the gut microbiome, the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in driving population-specific differences remains largely underexplored.

In this study, we systematically investigated gut microbial differences between the Han Chinese and non-Chinese populations using the Human Gut Microbiome Reference Genome Catalog (HGMRGC). HGMRGC includes 271,480 non-redundant genomes from 5,785 prokaryotic species, which was generated by metagenomic sequencing data from 9,320 publicly available samples across 22 countries and 3,584 newly sequenced samples from Han Chinese individuals across 29 provinces and regions in China.

We observed geography was the primary driver of microbial variation of abundance and SNPs. We identified 625 novel population-specific genome clusters from HGMRGC with functional differences in carbohydrate utilization and 126 species exhibiting distinct prevalence related to vitamin biosynthesis, antibiotic resistance, and carbohydrate metabolism. Beta diversity analysis highlighted significant inter-population differences in both microbial abundance and SNPs, while alpha diversity analysis revealed that non-Chinese populations exhibited higher diversity in microbial abundance, and Han Chinese populations displayed greater diversity in SNPs. These results provide valuable insights into population-specific microbial diversity, laying the groundwork for future research on its functional and health implications."
"Bacteria can resist antibiotics and toxic substances within demanding ecological settings, such as low oxygen, extreme acid, and during nutrient starvation. MdtEF, a proton motive force-driven efflux pump from the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) superfamily, is upregulated in these conditions but its molecular mechanism is unknown. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of Escherichia coli multidrug transporter MdtF within native-lipid nanodiscs, including a single-point mutant with an altered multidrug phenotype and associated substrate-bound form. We reveal that drug binding domain and channel conformational plasticity likely governs promiscuous substrate specificity, analogous to its closely related, constitutively expressed counterpart, AcrB. Whereas we discover distinct transmembrane state transitions within MdtF, which create a more engaged proton relay network, altered drug transport allostery and an acid-responsive increase in efflux efficiency. Physiologically, this provides means of xenobiotic and metabolite disposal within remodelled cell membranes that presage encounters with acid stresses, as endured in the gastrointestinal tract."
"Glucose sensing is vital for managing diabetes. However, current sensors are invasive and secrete enzymatic byproducts that are inflammatory and toxic. Though DNA-wrapped single-walled carbon nanotubes (DNA-SWCNTs) emit fluorescence that is ideal for enzyme-free optical sensing, existing approaches have yet to identify a DNA sequence that can elicit a fluorescence response to glucose. We develop an approach based on clustering to design a diverse library of 90 DNA sequences to screen for a glucose response. The most responsive sequence was further improved based on favorable mutations predicted by deep learning and pattern recognition. This combination of experimental screening and supervised and unsupervised machine learning represents a generalizable approach to developing DNA-SWCNT sensors for even the most elusive analytes.

"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the transmission of genetic material across species, is an important innovation source in prokaryotes. In contrast, its significance is unclear in many eukaryotes, including insects. Here, we used high-quality genomes of 45 termites and two cockroaches to investigate HGTs across blattodean genomes. We identified 289 genes and 2,494 pseudogenes classified into 168 orthologous groups originating from an estimated 281 HGT events. Wolbachia represented the primary HGT source, while termite gut bacteria and the cockroach endosymbiont Blattabacterium did not contribute meaningfully to HGTs. Most horizontally acquired genes descended from recent and species-specific HGTs, experienced frequent duplications and pseudogenizations, and accumulated substitutions faster than synonymous sites of native protein-coding genes. Genes frequently transferred horizontally to termite genomes included mobile genetic elements and genetic information processing genes. Our results indicate that termites continuously acquired genes through HGT, which they soon lost, leaving few horizontally acquired genes conserved across lineages."
"Bacterial adaptation to stress involves changes in transcription and mRNA degradation rates. In Escherichia coli, the Nudix hydrolase RppH initiates mRNA degradation by removing pyrophosphate from mRNA 5-ends, converting 5-triphosphates to 5-monophosphates. We aimed to identify the RppH homolog in the globally important pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We deleted each non-essential Nudix gene from Mtb to determine their impacts on mRNA phosphorylation states. Deletion of mutT4 (Rv3908) increased the relative abundance of 5-triphosphates on myriad mRNAs across the transcriptome. Purified MutT4 converted mRNA 5-triphosphates into monophosphates, and stimulated degradation by RNase E and RNase J. MutT4 has intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), a common domain for biomolecular condensate formation. Microscopy showed that MutT4 forms condensates that dissociate upon addition of rifampicin, and that the N-terminal IDR is sufficient for condensate formation. These MutT4 condensates localize with RNase E and RNase J. Deletion of mutT4 in Mtb leads to a higher outer membrane permeability and resistance to oxidative stress. We conclude that MutT4 is the RppH homolog of Mtb, assembling in condensates that may act as degradation hubs. Our data indicate that MutT4 is unlikely to participate in DNA repair or nucleotide pool cleansing, and as such would more accurately be named RppH."
"Plant-pathogen interactions are characterized by evolutionary arms races. At the molecular level, fungal effectors can target important plant functions, while plants evolve to improve effector recognition. Rapid evolution in genes encoding effectors can be facilitated by transposable elements (TEs). In Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of blast disease in several cereals and grasses, TEs play important roles in chromosomal evolution as well as the gain or loss of effector genes in host specialized lineages. However, a global understanding of TE dynamics driving effector evolution at population scale and across lineages is lacking. Here, we focus on 16 AVR effector loci assessed across a global sampling of 11 reference genomes and 447 newly generated draft genome assemblies across all major M. oryzae lineages and outgroups. We classified each effector based on evidence for duplication, deletion and translocation processes among lineages. Next, we determined AVR gain and loss dynamics across lineages allowing for a broad categorization of effector dynamics. Each AVR was integrated in a distinct genomic niche determined by the TE activity profile contributing to the diversification at the locus. We quantified TE contributions to effector niches and found that TE identity helped diversify AVR loci. We used the large genomic dataset to recapitulate the evolution of the rice blast AVR1-CO39 locus. Taken together, our work demonstrates how TE dynamics are an integral component of M. oryzae effector evolution, likely facilitating escape from host recognition. In-depth tracking of effector loci is a valuable tool to predict the durability of host resistance."
"ABHD5 plays a critical role in lipid metabolism, regulating fatty acid mobilization, skin barrier formation, and phospholipid remodeling. ABHD5 lacks catalytic activity and instead functions as an essential co-regulator of PNPLA enzymes. Understanding how ABHD5 interacts with lipid droplet (LD) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes is crucial for unraveling its regulatory role in lipid metabolism and identifying potential therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases. While previous studies have modeled ABHD5 structure in solution, its function relies on membrane interactions, requiring a detailed investigation of its binding mechanisms. In this study, we employed multiscale simulations with experimental validation to reveal how ABHD5 interacts with ER and LD. Our findings show that ABHD5 binds membranes through its N-terminus and insertion segment, which subsequently triggers structural changes in the pseudosubstrate pocket and alters lipid distribution. This study also identifies key residues essential for membrane binding, providing potential targets for developing lipid metabolism modulators. These results uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism by which ABHD5 interacts with membranes, offering new insights into lipolysis regulation and potential therapeutic strategies for metabolic diseases.

SignificanceLipid droplets (LDs) are central to cellular energy regulation, yet the structural mechanisms by which proteins bind and remodel LD membranes have remained poorly understood. This study provides the first molecular-level insights into how proteins interact with LDs and drive membrane remodeling. By integrating multiscale simulations with experimental validation, we reveal that ABHD5 binds to LD surfaces by adopting an open-pocket conformation, which enables it to exploit packing defects created by neutral lipids. This unique structural adaptation allows ABHD5 to interact with and reshape LD membranes effectively. Our findings establish a mechanistic framework for understanding protein-mediated LD dynamics, highlighting the critical role of neutral lipids in facilitating protein binding and membrane remodeling."
"Predicting whether single amino acid variants (SAVs) in proteins lead to pathogenic outcomes is a critical challenge in molecular biology and precision medicine. Experimental determination of the effects of all possible mutations or those observed in pathogenic individuals is infeasible. While existing state-of-the-art tools such as AlphaMissense show promise, their performance remains insufficient for diagnostic applications, they are often challenging to run locally. To address these limitations, we developed pLM-SAV, a simple yet effective predictor leveraging protein language models (pLMs). Our method computes delta-embeddings by subtracting the embedding of the mutant sequence from that of the wild type sequence. These delta-embedding vectors serve as input for a convolutional neural network used for training and prediction. To prevent data leakage, we trained our model on a well-characterized, labeled set of Eff10k and evaluated it on a non-homologous subset of ClinVar data. Our results demonstrate that this approach performs exceptionally well on the Eff10k test folds and reasonably on ClinVar test sets. Notably, pLM-SAV excels in resolving ambiguous predictions by AlphaMissense. We also found that an ensemble method, REVEL, outperforms both AlphaMissense and pLM-SAV, thus, we integrated these REVEL-enhanced predictions into our widely used AlphaMissense web application, https://alphamissens.hegelab.org. Our results demonstrate that an SAV predictor trained on labeled data can achieve high predictive performance. We anticipate that incorporating delta-embeddings into other mutation effect predictors or mutant structure prediction methods will further enhance their accuracy and utility in diverse biological contexts."
"Early detection of respiratory virus infections, such as influenza A (H3N2), is critical for timely intervention and disease management. Conventional biomarkers often overlook the complex and dynamic nature of gene regulatory changes, while existing predictive models frequently lack automation and robust external validation. Thus, we present CRISGI (Critical tran-Sient Gene Interaction), a computational framework that detects early-warning signals of infection by identifying dynamic changes in gene-gene interactions--termed critical transient interactions--from bulk RNA-seq data. CRISGI leverages critical transition (CT) theory to capture a GRNs unstable intermediate state, known as the CT stage, before irreversible phenotypic shifts. Applied to a human challenge study with H3N2, CRISGI identified 128 critical transition edges (128-TER). These were used to train predictive models capable of forecasting symptom status and onset timing. 128-TER was then validated across six temporal transcriptomic datasets involving three respiratory viruses (H3N2, H1N1, HRV). The 128-TER consistently distinguished symptomatic individuals, predicted infection onset, and revealed phenotype-specific enrichment patterns. Notably, CRISGI captured immune-related transitions involving interferon-stimulated genes (e.g., IFIT1, CXCL10), underscoring their role in early host defense. CRISGI advances early-warning biomarker discovery by integrating interaction-level dynamics and predictive modeling. Its reproducibility across viruses highlights shared immune activation pathways, supporting its utility in both research and clinical contexts."
"Cancer is a widespread disease claiming millions of lives each year, yet the relationship between cancer risk and age-related immune system decline (i.e., immunosenescence), specifically the ability of T cells to detect and eliminate cancerous cells, remains poorly understood. Here we analyze T cell receptor (TCR) {beta} repertoires from [~]30,000 subjects demonstrating that TCR diversity-- a key measure of immunocompetency--systematically declines between the ages of 20 and 80 years. Notably, this decline occurs 11 years later in females compared to males and coincides with their lower incidence of cancer, reinforcing the link between TCR diversity and cancer risk. Thus, using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we correlate our measured TCR diversity to cancer risk by modeling rising cancer incidence with age as the combined effect of accumulating mutations and the increasing probability that cells harboring these mutations evade immune detection due to loss of TCR diversity. Our analysis suggests that both of these processes significantly contribute to the risk of cancer and that lower cancer incidence in females is due to the delayed onset of immunosenescence. Our results highlight the importance of understanding immunosenescence in carcinogenesis, potentially providing new opportunities for immunotherapies targeting an aging immune system as well as personalized care leveraging TCR diversity as a biomarker."
"SummaryThe price, quality and throughout of DNA sequencing continue to improve. Algorithmic innovations have allowed inference of a growing range of features from DNA sequencing data, quantifying nuclear, mitochondrial and evolutionary aspects of both germline and somatic genomes. To automate analyses of the full range of genomic characteristics, we created an extensible Nextflow meta-pipeline called metapipeline-DNA. Metapipeline-DNA analyzes targeted and whole-genome sequencing data from raw reads through pre-processing, feature detection by multiple algorithms, quality-control and data- visualization. Each step can be run independently and is supported robust software engineering including automated failure-recovery, robust testing and consistent verifications of inputs, outputs and parameters. Metapipeline-DNA is cloud-compatible and highly configurable, with options to subset and optimize each analysis. Metapipeline-DNA facilitates high-scale, comprehensive analysis of DNA sequencing data.

"ObjectiveConverging evidence from neuroimaging studies and genome-wide association study (GWAS) suggests the involvement of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum dysfunction in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa (AN). However, identifying the causal role of circuit-specific genes in the development of AN-like phenotype remains challenging and requires the combination of novel molecular tools and preclinical models.

MethodsWe used the activity-based anorexia (ABA) rat model in combination with a novel viral-based translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) technique to identify transcriptional differences within a specific neural pathway that we have previously demonstrated to mediate pathological weight loss in ABA rats (i.e. medial prefrontal cortex neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens shell). We compared actively transcribed genes in rats susceptible to weight loss to the subpopulation of rats resistant to weight loss under the same experimental conditions.

ResultsWe reveal 1424 differentially expressed genes between Susceptible and Resistant rats, highlighting important transcriptional changes associated with ABA within this pathway. The changes observed were independent of current calorie deficit and associated with metabolic, mitochondrial and neural functions. Further, we show that genes upregulated in Resistant rats were involved in mitochondrial function, while downregulated genes were associated with cytoskeletal, postsynaptic and axonal functions, supporting the hypothesis that hyperexcitability of cortico-striatal circuit function is a critical mediator of pathological weight loss in ABA.

DiscussionThese findings represent an essential first step in understanding how circuit-specific gene expression patterns may contribute to susceptibility to ABA and provide potential molecular targets for manipulation in this animal model of AN.

Public SignificanceThis study identifies specific brain gene activity patterns that may explain why some individuals are more vulnerable to extreme weight loss, as seen in anorexia nervosa. Using an advanced molecular technique in a well-established animal model, key differences in a neural pathway linked to cognitive control were observed. These findings pave the way for more targeted treatments that could prevent or reverse this dangerous condition.

SummaryO_LITranscriptional differences within medial prefrontal cortex to nucleus accumbens shell (mPFC-AcbSh) neurons distinguish rats highly susceptible to activity-based anorexia (ABA) from those resistant to pathological weight loss.
C_LIO_LIResistant rats showed upregulation of mitochondrial function genes, while Susceptible rats had upregulation of genes related to synaptic structure and signalling, implicating excitability of this circuit in driving maladaptive weight loss behaviour.
C_LIO_LITranscriptomic changes align with human genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings and support links between anorexia nervosa and both metabolic and psychiatric comorbidities.
C_LIO_LIThe study highlights potential molecular targets for future gene manipulation and therapeutic intervention. It also provides a foundation for creating refined genetic animal models that integrate multiple AN-associated variants to better reflect the polygenic nature of the disorder.

"The evolution of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) pathogens poses a global health threat and it is unclear if evolutionary trajectories to resistance lead to predictable phenotypes. We analyzed AMR-evolution in the human pathogen Haemophilus influenzae in controlled evolution experiments with increasing concentrations of either ampicillin, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone. We isolated 315 clones from different time points of six independent experiments and characterized changes in genome sequences, bacterial fitness, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to 14 antibiotics. Resistance evolution under ampicillin and cefotaxime was driven by mutations in the ftsI gene, encoding the penicillin-binding protein 3. However, ceftriaxone exposure mainly selected for mutations in the outer membrane protein P2 (OmpP2). Some OmpP2-mutants reproducibly showed heteroresistance for ceftriaxone but also for fluoroquinolones, rifampicin and tetracycline. Bacterial fitness assessments revealed trade-offs between resistance-associated mutations and growth, though no systematic correlation of MIC increase and growth deficit was detected. Over 50% of the mutants became more susceptible to aminoglycosides, clarithromycin, and colistin, while some mutation patterns resulted in cross-resistance to meropenem and fluoroquinolones. Overall, beta-lactam antibiotics reproducibly selected mutants with increased MICs, but evolutionary pathways and resulting phenotypes remain unpredictable, challenging current AMR treatment guidelines, and recommendations for last resort antibiotics."
"Antibiotic resistance is increasing among bacterial pathogens, posing one of the most severe threats to future public health. A major contributor to the increasing resistance is the dissemination of mobile antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among bacterial communities. These genes are ubiquitously present in various environments and are especially diverse in the human gut and wastewater. Despite this, the clinical implications of the prevalence of ARGs in these bacterial communities remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate how the prevalence of ARGs in human gut and wastewater microbiomes reflects their dissemination among important bacterial pathogens. To do this, we estimated the prevalence of >30,000 ARGs, including both well-known (established) and computationally predicted (latent) genes, in >6,000 metagenomic samples. From their prevalence in the human gut and wastewater, we identified four categories of ARGs: co-promoted, human gut (HG)-promoted, wastewater (WW)- promoted, and non-promoted. Our results showed that co-promoted ARGs were by far the most promiscuous, being more frequently found across multiple bacterial phyla, and more often co-localized with broad host range conjugative elements. Co-promoted ARGs were also found to be overrepresented among genes identified in multiple pathogenic species and exhibited an overall higher genetic compatibility with both pathogens and other typical residents of the human gut and wastewater microbiomes. Taken together, our results highlight the link between the promotion of ARGs in the human gut and wastewater microbiomes and their presence in human pathogens, and, thereby, the genes potential risk to human health."
"BACKGROUNDAlloimmunization to transfused red blood cells (RBCs) remains a significant clinical problem. However, the cells that initiate immune responses to transfused RBCs remain incompletely characterized.

Recently published work has identified splenic marginal zone B (MZB) cells as being critically required for the production of anti-RBC alloantibodies in response to RBCs. In infectious models, MZB cell activation has been shown to depend on a unique population of marginal zone macrophages (MZMs). We hypothesized that MZMs would capture stored RBCs and present them to MZBs, and ultimately MZMs would be required for generation of anti-RBC alloantibodies in response to stored RBC transfusion.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSStored GFP+ murine RBCs were utilized to determine the splenic localization and erythrophagocytosis by splenic macrophage populations. To determine the functional impact of MZMs, we compared LXR-KO mice, which have been reported to lack MZMs, with wild type mice. Both innate and adaptive immune responses to stored HOD allogenic RBC transfusion were measured in LXR-KO and wild type mice.

RESULTSRBC storage leads to a significant increase in the phagocytosis of transfused RBCs by splenic MZMs. LXR-KO mice demonstrated a lack of MZMs and had significantly decreased rapid phase production of cytokines MCP-1 and KC, but similar levels of IL-6. Surprisingly, anti-RBC alloantibody levels were unaffected by the absence of splenic MZMs.

CONCLUSIONSSplenic MZMs are involved in the innate response to transfused stored HOD RBCs, contributing to both MCP-1 and KC cytokine production. However, MZMs are dispensable for anti-RBC alloantibody production."
"Adoptive cell therapies such as CAR T cells have revolutionized cancer treatment and shown successes even with refractory cases of haematological malignancies. There is burgeoning interest in the optimization and improved manufacturing of cell therapy products. For CAR T cell therapy, enrichment of certain phenotypes of T cells in the infusion product have been correlated with improved long-term treatment outcomes. While metabolic control of T cell phenotypic fates has been demonstrated in some contexts, gaps still exist in our knowledge of how T cell metabolic dynamics early during CAR T manufacturing might affect critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the final product (e.g., differentiation/exhaustion/potency). We present a modelling framework that can perform real-time estimation of per-cell metabolic rates of T cells expanded ex vivo in a reactor. We validate our estimated rates using metabolic assays, show how average rates can be deconvoluted to rates of individual T cell phenotypes, and demonstrate applicability to different reactor types. Applying our tool to the expansion of both healthy and patient-derived cells in a perfusion-based microbioreactor, we offer proof-of-principle to show that correlations exist between early metabolic rates of T cells in culture and cellular attributes related to growth, differentiation and exhaustion of the final product. Given the biological variation that exists in the growth and dynamics of patient-derived cells in culture, such modelling contributes to the overarching goal of improving the consistency of cell therapy through Adaptive Process Control (APC)."
"1.Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, driven by tumor heterogeneity, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. While Rho GTPases are well-established regulators of oncogenic processes, the role of the atypical GTPases in NSCLC remains unexplored. Here, we identified RHOV as one of the commonly upregulated Rho GTPases in NSCLC. Analysis of four independent patient cohorts revealed that elevated RHOV expression serves as a robust and independent prognosticator of NSCLC patients specifically early-stage disease. Functionally, RHOV knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation, whereas its overexpression enhanced proliferation. Similarly, RHOV depletion suppressed cell migration by disrupting cytoskeletal dynamics, while its overexpression promoted migratory capacity. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that RHOV is a direct transcriptional target of the TGF{beta}-SMAD3 signaling pathway. RNA-seq analysis identified MYC as a critical downstream mediator of RHOV; RHOV knockdown reduced MYC expression, impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and inducing ROS-mediated DNA damage--a phenotype rescued by MYC overexpression. Furthermore, RHOV inhibition sensitized NSCLC cells to etoposide but not doxorubicin. immunoprecipitation coupled with LC-MS revealed PEAK1 as a key interactor of RHOV. The RHOV-PEAK1 complex proved essential for NSCLC proliferation, as PEAK1 silencing abolished RHOV- driven MYC upregulation and tumor growth. This axis sustains MYC levels and activates PI3K/MAPK signaling. Intriguingly, PEAK1 depletion elevated TGF-{beta} levels, which suppressed RHOV expression, establishing a negative feedback loop wherein PEAK1 maintains RHOV by inhibiting TGF-{beta} signaling. Collectively, our findings establish RHOV as a prognostic biomarker and a driver of NSCLC progression via the RHOV-PEAK1-MYC axis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

HighlightsO_LIRHOV upregulation predicts poor NSCLC survival, particularly in early-stage disease.
C_LIO_LIThe RHOV-PEAK1 interaction is crucial for NSCLC growth and cell migration.
C_LIO_LIRHOV inhibition sensitizes NSCLC cells to Etoposide treatment.

"Primary cerebral phaeohyphomycosis (PCP) is a severe neurological infection caused by neurotropic dematiaceous fungi, affecting both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Understanding the virulence and adaptation mechanisms of these fungal pathogens is crucial for developing effective treatment strategies. This study employed Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing to explore the genomes of Cladophialophora bantiana, Fonsecaea monophora, and Cladosporium cladosporioides, three key species associated with PCP. KEGG pathway analysis revealed significant enrichments in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, highlighting the metabolic versatility of these fungi. The analysis of transposable elements showed varying proportions of repeats, with C. bantiana exhibiting the highest repeat content. Additionally, the presence of diverse families of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) emphasized their capacity for metabolizing complex carbohydrates. The analysis also identified enrichments in secondary metabolite (SM) biosynthetic gene clusters and stress adaptation pathways. All three genera possess essential genes for thermal stress adaptation, such as HSP60 and HSF1, along with enzymes for detoxifying reactive oxygen species. The examination of pathogenicity-related genes uncovered a range of virulence factors, including lethal and hypervirulence genes, which raise critical concerns for human health. Functional annotations linked many of these genes to CAZymes, SMs, and stress response proteins. Furthermore, multiple efflux transporters and genes associated with antifungal resistance were identified, indicating potential adaptive mechanisms for drug resistance. This study not only advances our understanding of the genomic features of these fungi but also highlights their ecological and clinical significance, providing a foundation for future research into their pathogenicity and resistance mechanisms."
"O_LIEnvironmental salinity levels vary naturally across terrestrial ecosystems but can be heightened locally by rising sea levels and desertification as well as human activities such as road salt application and agriculture. Since salt is essential for many physiological processes in insects, rising environmental sodium concentrations may drive behavioral changes, where insects select environments and food sources with suitable sodium levels, or evolutionary changes in constitutive or plastic physiological mechanisms to process salt, potentially altering ecological dynamics and species interactions.
C_LIO_LINumerous hematophagous (blood feeding) insects are known to breed in relatively saline environments, while others such as the yellow-fever mosquito Aedes aeqypti are expanding their range to coastal regions. Among phytophagous (plant feeding) insects, grasshoppers can be important herbivores in arid and coastal salt-affected regions, whereas the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) appears to perform relatively well on milkweed host plants growing in roadsides influenced by salt runoff. Several of these insects share a common trait: amino acid substitutions in the first extracellular loop of the Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), a highly conserved sodium pump crucial for maintaining ion balance. For the monarch these substitutions confer resistance to toxic cardenolides from milkweeds, but it is unclear whether NKA substitutions may influence salt tolerance.
C_LIO_LIHere, we investigate whether the NKA substitutions found in these insects may contribute to salt tolerance using gene-edited Drosophila melanogaster mutant strains as models. We show that flies with the Q111L and A119S substitutions alone or in combination (found in grasshoppers and several hematophagous insects) exhibited greater salt tolerance, whereas flies carrying the combination of substitutions found in the monarch (Q111V, A119S, and N122H) did not.
C_LIO_LIOur results suggest that the monarch may rely on alternate mechanisms for salt tolerance and that its NKA substitutions are important primarily for cardenolide resistance. However, substitutions Q111L and A119S may be important for salt tolerance in a variety of insects. Uncovering mechanisms of salt tolerance enhances our understanding of species distributions, ecological interactions, and evolutionary physiology in response to changing environmental salinity levels.

"Parkinsons disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. It is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), -synuclein (-syn) and phosphorylated-tau protein (p-tau) aggregation, and dopaminergic neuron cell death. Current drug therapies only provide temporary symptomatic relief and fail to stop or reverse disease progression due to the severe side effects or the blood-brain barrier. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of thermal cycling-hyperthermia (TC-HT) in an in vitro PD model using rotenone (ROT)-induced human neural SH-SY5Y cells. Our results revealed that TC-HT pretreatment conferred neuroprotective effects in the ROT-induced in vitro PD model using human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, including reducing ROT-induced mitochondrial apoptosis and ROS accumulation in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, TC-HT also inhibited the expression of -syn and p-tau through heat-activated pathways associated with sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70), involved in protein chaperoning, and resulted in the phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3{beta} (GSK-3{beta}), which inhibit p-tau formation. These findings underscore the potential of TC-HT as an effective treatment for PD in vitro, supporting its further investigation in in vivo models or potentially in human trials, with focused ultrasound (FUS) as a feasible heat-delivery approach."
"Breast carcinoma amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2), a core component of the hPrP19 complex, plays crucial roles in various physiological and pathological processes. However, whether BCAS2 has functions other than being a key RNA-splicing regulator within the nucleus remains unknown. Here, we show that BCAS2 is essential for primitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish and mouse embryos. The activation of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signal, which is required for hematopoietic progenitor differentiation, is significantly decreased upon depletion of bcas2 in zebrafish embryos and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Interestingly, BCAS2 deficiency has no obvious impact on the splicing efficiency of {beta}-catenin pre-mRNA, while significantly attenuating {beta}-catenin nuclear accumulation. Moreover, we find that BCAS2 directly binds to {beta}-catenin via its coiled-coil domains, thereby sequestering {beta}-catenin within the nucleus. Thus, our results uncover a previously unknown function of BCAS2 in promoting Wnt signaling by enhancing {beta}-catenin nuclear retention during primitive hematopoiesis."
"Parent-offspring relationships can have profound effects on offspring behavior, health, and fitness in adulthood. These effects are strong when parents make heavy investments in offspring care. However, in some mammals, including several species of carnivores, rodents, and primates, fathers live and socialize with offspring, but paternal care per se is subtle or indirect. Do these limited father-offspring relationships also affect later-life outcomes for offspring? Working in a well-studied baboon population where males contribute little direct offspring care, we found that juvenile female baboons who had stronger paternal relationships, or who resided longer with their fathers, led adult lives that were 2-4 years longer than females with weak or short paternal relationships. This pattern did not differ between females who experienced high versus low levels of early-life adversity; hence, paternal relationships were equally protective in both harsh and benign early environments. Males relationships were strongest with juvenile females they were most likely to have sired and when males had few mating opportunities. Hence, father-daughter relationships may be constrained by male mating effort. Because survival predicts female fitness, fathers and their daughters may experience selection to engage socially and stay close in daughters early lives."
"Despite the high efficacy of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), approximately 10-20% of patients develop drug resistance due to mutations in PML-RAR and other factors. Here, it is demonstrated that inhibiting USP2 with ML364 or silencing USP2 reduces PML-RAR protein levels in both ATRA-sensitive and -resistant APL cells, an effect reversed by proteasome inhibition. Conversely, USP2 overexpression enhances PML-RAR stability. Mechanistically, USP2 interacts with and deubiquitinates PML-RAR, including drug-resistant mutants. Consistent with PML-RAR degradation, ML364 treatment significantly induces apoptosis in APL cell lines and primary leukemia cells. In conclusion, this study identifies USP2 as a novel deubiquitinating enzyme for PML-RAR and highlights USP2 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for APL with PML-RAR mutations."
"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by muscle wasting, and leading to premature death. The pathogenesis of DMD is complex. It is triggered by loss of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin, which causes muscle fiber instability and damage, followed by chronic inflammation and fibrotic replacement of damaged muscle tissue. Here we investigated the hypothesis that inhibition of neutrophil elastase, which is increased in dystrophic mice and impairs myogenesis, could provide a therapeutic effect in DMD. While neutrophil elastase inhibition, via the orally bioavailable compound Alvelestat, enhances myogenesis both in vitro and in vivo and reduces muscle damage and fibrosis, it does not produce a significant beneficial effect on the functional outcomes. However, when co- administered with the standard of care Prednisolone, Alvelestat dramatically enhances Prednisolone efficacy in a mouse model of DMD. In key functional tests, the performance of mice co-dosed with Alvelestat and Prednisolone is almost three times better than that of mice treated with Prednisolone alone. Additionally, co-administration of Alvelestat and Prednisolone reduces Prednisolones negative effects on muscle mass and resistance to fatigue. These findings are consistent with the finding that Prednisolone induces neutrophil elastase expression in patients affected by DMD. Our data support a beneficial role for neutrophil elastase inhibition in a mouse model of DMD that is also treated with Prednisolone, suggesting that a combinatorial therapy for DMD including a corticosteroid and a neutrophil elastase inhibitor could be trialed in humans.

"The Notch signaling pathway is crucial for germline stem cell (GSC) regulation in C. elegans, yet the molecular and biological consequences of GLP-1/Notch mutations remain poorly understood. This study systematically analyzes commonly used and clinically relevant glp-1 loss- and gain-of-function mutations to investigate their effects on Notch activity at chromosomal, cellular, and tissue levels. Using complementary direct readouts of Notch activation, including sygl-1 activation sites, mRNA levels, and germline functional assays of the GSC pool and progenitor zone (PZ), we demonstrate that the severity of glp-1 mutations is dependent on their position within the GLP-1 protein. Our results reveal that NICD mutations reduce Notch transcriptional activation at tissue and cellular levels while having little impact at the chromosomal level, whereas NECD mutations have minimal effects across all biological levels. Furthermore, a series of regression analyses of sygl-1 activation, mRNA production, and PZ size reveal strong correlations, qualifying these readouts as predictive markers for germline function. These findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding glp-1 mutation effects and offer new insights into the regulation of Notch signaling in stem cell biology."
"Motivation: The availability of bulkomic data is steadily increasing, necessitating collaborative efforts between experimental and computational researchers. While software tools with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) enable rapid and interactive data assessment, they are limited to pre-implemented methods, often requiring transitions to custom code for further adjustments. However, most available tools lack GUI-independent reproducibility such as direct integration with R, resulting in very limited support for transition. Results: We introduce the customizable Omics Analysis and reporting tool - cOmicsArt. cOmicsArt aims to enhance collaboration through integration of GUI-based analysis with R.

"The RAC1P29S hotspot mutation, prevalent in melanoma, drives tumorigenesis by enhancing molecular interactions and hyperactivating key signaling pathways, making it a compelling target for cancer therapy. This study provides a comprehensive biochemical characterization of RAC1P29S compared to wild-type RAC1 and mutations T17N and F28L. The P29S mutation significantly impairs nucleotide binding to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and guanosine diphosphate, accelerating intrinsic nucleotide exchange. While minimally affecting regulation by guanosine dissociation inhibitor 1, RAC1P29S exhibits reduced activation via diffuse B-cell lymphoma family guanine nucleotide exchange factors but retains effective activation by dedicator of cytokinesis 2. Critically, the P29S mutation severely impairs GTPase-activating protein-stimulated GTP hydrolysis, most likely contributing to RAC1P29S hyperactivation by prolonging its GTP-bound form. RAC1P29S displays a stronger binding affinity for IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 than for p21-activated kinase 1, highlighting the role of the former in scaffolding RAC1P29S-driven signaling. In serum-starved cells, RAC1P29S predominantly adopts an active GTP-bound state. RAC1P29S overexpression activates key cancer-associated pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, reinforcing its role as an oncogenic driver in melanoma. These insights suggest potential therapeutic targets for melanoma treatment, including RAC1 regulators and modulators.

RAC1P29S remains in an inactive GDP-bound state in the cytoplasm where GDI1 prevents its membrane association. Upon stimulation, GEFs, primarily DOCK2, activate RAC1P29S by promoting GDP-GTP exchange, facilitating its transition to the active GTP-bound state and initiating downstream signaling. RAC1P29S binds preferentially to IQGAP1 over PAK1, reflecting a shift in effector interactions. IQGAP1 acts as a scaffolding protein, spatially modulating RAC1P29S-driven signaling and amplifying its effects. Under normal conditions, GAPs such as p50GAP regulate RAC1 by accelerating GTP hydrolysis, thereby maintaining its dynamic activation cycle. However, the P29S mutation severely impairs p50GAP-mediated hydrolysis, leading to accumulation of RAC1P29S in its GTP-bound state and loss of temporal regulation. This persistent activation hyperactivates downstream effectors and promotes cancer-associated pathways, including ERK and p38 MAPK, which drive cell growth, survival, invasion and metastasis."
"Nerve injury triggers dramatic atrophy of skeletal muscle, accompanied with synaptic and metabolic changes. Regulation of denervation-induced muscle fiber remodeling involves several factors governing genetic reprogramming and proteostasis changes. Here, we demonstrate that the transcriptional co-repressor CtBP1 coordinates synaptic and metabolic changes in muscle fibers upon denervation. CtBP1 was present both in sub- and non-synaptic myonuclei in innervated muscle. Although CtBP1 levels remained unchanged in denervated muscle, CtBP1 accumulated transiently in myonuclei after 2 days of denervation. Ctbp1 knockdown perturbed the expression of a large set of activity-independent and -dependent genes in innervated and denervated skeletal muscles. CtBP1 loss had limited effect on the expression of most synaptic genes, but increased transcript levels of Chrne, encoding the adult {varepsilon} sub-unit of acetylcholine receptors (AChR). However, it did not affect AChR turnover or maintenance of the post-synaptic compartment upon denervation. Importantly, we uncovered that Ctbp1 knockdown promotes denervation-induced changes in metabolic gene expression, including most genes encoding proteins of the respiratory chain complexes. Consistently, it enhanced the switch towards slower, oxidative fibers in fast muscle after 2 weeks of denervation. Moreover, CtBP1 loss precipitated the profound ultrastructural remodeling of mitochondria network induced after denervation. Hence, our study unveils the role of CtBP1 in the integrated muscle response to denervation, with important implications for CtBP1-related muscle diseases.

"Human bone marrow-derived stromal cells (also termed mesenchymal stem cell - MSCs) are progenitors capable of differentiating into bone forming osteoblasts and fat storing adipocytes. Due to the loss of bone mass being associated with increased marrow fat, trans-differentiation of osteoblasts into adipocytes been hypothesized as a contributor to osteoporotic bone loss and fragility. Reprogramming of transcriptional networks is a prerequisite for cellular differentiation, however, to which extent cell-type specific transcriptional networks modulate cellular plasticity within stromal cells remains unknown. In this study we performed gene expression analysis at bulk and single cell level in stromal cells being repeatedly exposed to osteogenic and adipogenic inducers in vitro. Surprisingly, cell type specific gene networks are not suppressive but instead promoting to obtain an opposing phenotype, e.g., enhanced osteoblast differentiation of adipogenic pre-stimulated stromal cells compared to undifferentiated ones. This is supported by the presence of cells simultaneously showing an osteogenic and adipogenic phenotype highlighting a strong molecular plasticity of transcriptional networks in stromal cells. These observations provide a strong molecular support for the notion of not only progenitor speciation but also the plasticity of differentiated cells contributing to the balance of bone mass and marrow fat content.

SummaryWe provide mechanistic evidence, that cells with established lineage-selective gene programs are more vulnerable to obtain gene signatures and phenotypes of opposing lineages, building ground for trans-differentiation between osteoblasts and adipocytes being a coordinated process rather than random and misdirected."
"C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonists may improve both acute stroke outcome and long-term recovery. Despite their evaluation in ongoing clinical trials, gaps remain in the evidence supporting their use. With a panel of patients with lived experiences of stroke, we performed a systematic review of animal models of stroke that administered a CCR5 antagonist and assessed infarct size or behavioural outcomes. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase were searched. Article screening and data extraction were completed in duplicate. We pooled outcomes using random effects meta-analyses. We assessed risk of bias using the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool and alignment with the Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) and Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable (SRRR) recommendations. Five studies representing 10 experiments were included. CCR5 antagonists reduced infarct volume (standard mean difference -1.02; 95% confidence interval -1.58 to -0.46) when compared to stroke-only controls. Varied timing of CCR5 administration (pre- or post-stroke induction) produced similar benefit. CCR5 antagonists significantly improved 11 of 16 behavioural outcomes reported. High risk of bias was present in all studies and critical knowledge gaps in the preclinical evidence were identified using STAIR/SRRR. CCR5 antagonists demonstrate promise; however, rigorously designed preclinical studies that better align with STAIR/SRRR recommendations and downstream clinical trials are warranted.

"With the explosion of chromosome-scale genome assemblies being generated in recent years, there is vast potential for comparative genomics analyses through detecting multi-genome synteny. While existing tools can detect synteny blocks between multiple genomes, their text-based outputs make it challenging to intuitively explore large-scale synteny patterns. Interpretable, information-rich and easy-to-use synteny visualization tools are imperative to enable important biological insights from the synteny block data output by the aforementioned utilities. Here, we present ntSynt-viz, a command-line tool for automated sorting, normalization and plotting of multi-genome synteny blocks. We show how ntSynt-viz provides clearer and more easily interpretable chromosome-painting ribbon plots compared to the state-of-the-art tool NGenomeSyn when evaluating synteny between 14 human genomes and 9 hoverfly genomes. We expect that ntSynt-viz will provide crucial insights into large-scale synteny patterns between divergent genomes, thereby advancing research into key evolutionary questions. ntSynt-viz is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/bcgsc/ntsynt-viz)."
"MKI67 (Ki67) is expressed exclusively in proliferating cells in human tissues, rendering it as a valuable diagnostic marker for cancer. However, the function of this protein in cells remains unclear. In this study, we present the findings on the regulatory functions of MKI67 in conjunction with its partner proteins GNL2 and MDN1, which are involved in pre-ribosome processing, as well as the regulatory functions in its absence. In proliferating HEK293T cells, MKI67 binds contiguously to the chromatin in conjunction with GNL2 and MDN1, localizing most densely to the nucleolar periphery to regulate 60S pre-ribosome export. On the other hand, RNA-seq analysis reveals that these three proteins can independently regulate many target transcripts, but they often share their target transcripts, yet often regulate them at different expression levels. MDN1 depletion strongly downregulates RNA gene transcripts involved in ribosome biogenesis and splicing. In contrast, MKI67 depletion strongly upregulates transcripts of protein-coding genes, including synapse-specific proteins and the mitosis-related protein NEK7. Furthermore, MKI67 depletion coordinately up-or down-regulates the levels of transcripts of several pathways, thereby enabling MKI67-depleted cells to adapt to less active metabolic states. The underlying mechanism by which MKI67 depletion upregulates transcripts appears to involve attenuation of transcript levels in cooperation with mRNA degradation systems, as evidenced by analysis of NEK7 and UNC13A translations. In conclusion, the present results indicate that MKI67 contributes to proliferation via nucleolar export of 60S pre-ribosome particles and high energy supply. Conversely, its absence leads the cells to adapt to the senescent and differentiated conditions."
"Gene Transfer Agents (GTAs) are mobile genetic elements derived from bacteriophages that mediate genome-wide horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in diverse groups of prokaryotes. BaGTA, encoded by all the pathogens of the genus Bartonella, is a chimeric GTA that evolved by the domestication of two phages. The run-off-replication module ROR of one phage is integrated with the capsid production, DNA packaging and lysis machinery Bgt of a second phage. Restricted to a self-sacrificing subset of the bacterial population, the position-specific DNA amplification and packaging of a genomic plasticity region enriched for genes involved in host interaction and adaptation selectively enhances the HGT frequency of these pathogenicity genes. This feature of BaGTA is considered a key innovation underlying the evolutionary success of Bartonella. Little is known, however, about the mechanism mediating the coordinated expression of the ror and bgt loci. Here, we established the regulatory hierarchy, with ror acting upstream of the capsid gene cluster bgtA-K. BrrG, encoded by the ror locus, controls the transcription of the bgtA-K operon by functioning as a processive antiterminator. This study provides the first insights into the mechanism controlling the coordinated expression of the two BaGTA modules of divergent phage origin. Beyond BaGTA, we propose that antitermination is a broadly relevant mechanism for controlling HGT by GTAs of the Alphaproteobacteria."
"Tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) are innate immune cells that participate in tissue development, homeostasis, and immune surveillance. Extensive efforts have been made to recapitulate TRM development from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in vitro to study molecular and cellular mechanisms of TRM development and to create cellular models of disease.

However, available PSC models of mouse TRM development exhibit low overall efficiencies of TRM generation, produce heterogeneous off-target populations, and rely upon undefined media components, thus limiting their reproducibility, scalability, and widespread application as an experimental platform for TRM biology. To address these important limitations, we developed an efficient and reproducible protocol to faithfully recapitulate the stepwise differentiation of mouse PSCs (epiblast stem cells) into unspecialized, proliferative TRMs through the pro-definitive hematopoietic program under defined conditions. These immature TRMs can stably integrate into developing mouse neural organoids in vitro and acquire features of microglia. In addition, PSC-derived immature TRMs can stably engraft into the lung niche in vivo and adopt alveolar macrophage characteristics. This new platform for modeling mouse TRM development represents a powerful experimental model system for studying TRM function and dysfunction in development and disease."
"Rett syndrome (RTT) (OMIM: 312750) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. Although decreased dendritic morphogenesis has been observed in the brain of RTT patients and mouse models, the molecular mechanisms underlying these dendritic anomalies remain unclear. We have previously shown that MeCP2 facilitates specific microRNA (miRNA) processing by associating with the miRNA microprocessor Drosha complex. In this study, we show that MeCP2 positively regulates dendritic formation via miR-199a, a specific target of the MeCP2-Drosha complex. Overexpression of MeCP2 and miR-199a promotes dendritic development such as increases in dendrite length, branching number, and complexity. In contrast, blocking miR-199a inhibited dendrite formation and abolished enhanced dendritic development induced by MeCP2 expression. We also demonstrate that the decreased dendrite outgrowth observed in MeCP2-deficient neurons could be rescued by miR-199a expression. In addition, we found that miR-199a targets the 3 untranslated region of quaking (Qki), a negative regulator of dendritic development, and downregulates its protein expression level. Furthermore, we report an increase in the Qki protein expression level in miR-199a-2-deficient brains and show that Qki knockdown restores the dendritic morphology of miR-199a-2-Knockout (KO) neurons. Taken together, these results suggest that the MeCP2/miR-199a/Qki axis is critical for proper dendritic development and its dysregulation contributes to the dendritic pathology in RTT."
"Appropriate development of long-range nervous system circuitry requires dynamic regulation of subcellular mRNA localization, but little is known about how specific neuron subtypes control this critical process in vivo. Here, we employ an integrated genetic and temporally controlled approach to investigate in vivo developmental mRNA dynamics in somata and axons of a prototypical cerebral cortex projection neuron subtype, callosal projection neurons (CPN), which connect the cortical hemispheres to integrate sensorimotor information, and regulate high-level associative cognition and behavior. We identify cis-regulatory elements that are associated with mRNA turnover in CPN somata, including specific 3 untranslated regions (UTRs), and elucidate distinct modes of axon transport in CPN axons for function-specific mRNA classes. Together, these findings elucidate how developing CPN control subcellular mRNA localization, and how dysregulation of these processes might lead to neurodevelopmental and/or neurodegenerative disorders. More broadly, this work identifies general mRNA localization mechanisms that likely function across projection neuron subtypes, and in other polarized cells."
"The reduced effectiveness of chemotherapy in many patients highlights the need for novel drug combinations and optimal ratios that target multiple survival mechanisms, which tumors may engage to confer drug resistance. Dynamic conditions within the tumor microenvironment shape cell behavior and influence the response to anti-cancer drugs, varying by cell type and local context. Accordingly, assays that identify effective concentrations and drug interactions (additive, synergistic, or antagonistic) in a relevant tumor tissue model are required to discover new combination treatments. To address this need for combinatorial chemotherapeutic (CTx) screening assays, we reconfigured CombiANT, a device for testing antibiotic interactions, and present a new assay called CombiCTx. The assay uses a device with three reservoirs containing gels loaded with chemotherapeutics or other anti-cancer drugs. The drug-loaded device is inverted and placed in a standard culture dish containing cancer cells, and both are then enclosed in gel. As drugs diffuse from the reservoirs, cancer cells are exposed to overlapping dynamic gradients of anti-cancer drugs, which can interact in various ways. We imaged doxorubicin diffusion in the assay using timelapse microscopy and employed the apoptotic agent staurosporine as a model drug, and established an imaging protocol for quantifying MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell apoptosis along drug diffusion gradients. Finally, we tested navitoclax and gemcitabine to demonstrate the capacity of CombiCTx to evaluate combined cytotoxic effects while accounting for drug diffusion. Evaluating drug combinations with an assay that accounts for drug properties that influence diffusion in a complex tumor matrix may provide clinically relevant information."
"Adoptive cell therapies such as CAR T cells have revolutionized cancer treatment and shown successes even with refractory cases of haematological malignancies. There is burgeoning interest in the optimization and improved manufacturing of cell therapy products. For CAR T cell therapy, enrichment of certain phenotypes of T cells in the infusion product have been correlated with improved long-term treatment outcomes. While metabolic control of T cell phenotypic fates has been demonstrated in some contexts, gaps still exist in our knowledge of how T cell metabolic dynamics early during CAR T manufacturing might affect critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the final product (e.g., differentiation/exhaustion/potency). We present a modelling framework that can perform real-time estimation of per-cell metabolic rates of T cells expanded ex vivo in a reactor. We validate our estimated rates using metabolic assays, show how average rates can be deconvoluted to rates of individual T cell phenotypes, and demonstrate applicability to different reactor types. Applying our tool to the expansion of both healthy and patient-derived cells in a perfusion-based microbioreactor, we offer proof-of-principle to show that correlations exist between early metabolic rates of T cells in culture and cellular attributes related to growth, differentiation and exhaustion of the final product. Given the biological variation that exists in the growth and dynamics of patient-derived cells in culture, such modelling contributes to the overarching goal of improving the consistency of cell therapy through Adaptive Process Control (APC)."
"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness, driven by the progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Stem cell-derived RGC transplantation could revolutionize glaucoma treatment, but the inner limiting membrane (ILM) remains a major obstacle by hindering cell migration into the retina. Interestingly, the ILM represents a double-edged sword for RGC engraftment: on the one hand, it greatly hinders cell migration, whereas on the other hand, its presence during retinal development is necessary for neuronal migration and retinal lamination. As an alternative to current invasive and harmful strategies to disrupt the ILM, we introduce ILM photodisruption, a minimally invasive biophotonic method that can manipulate the integrity of the ILM with unprecedented precision. In this study, we have finetuned the technology in bovine and human organotypic retinal explants to create templated ILM pores, creating entryways for donor RGCs to enter the retina while preserving most of the membrane to confer guidance cues for their engraftment. Applying this technology, we were able to promote donor RGC survival, enhance cell spreading and facilitate integration into the retina. Overall, our findings demonstrate that ILM photodisruption effectively addresses a key barrier in RGC replacement, paving the way for advancing retinal regeneration toward clinical application."
"Honeybees (Apis mellifera) rely on a specialized gut microbiome shaped by climate, flora, agrochemicals, and dietary supplements. Yet, how these factors alter microbiome composition and function remains unclear.

We integrated 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomics data from eight published studies across six regions, alongside newly generated 16S data from Armenia, to assess how environmental and agrochemical factors influence the honeybee gut microbiome. We also introduced a novel co-abundance and functional analysis pipeline to identify treatment-affected bacterial networks and associated pathways.

We observed a stable core of six to twelve phylotypes in amplicon and metagenomic datasets respectively. However, we note significant geographic variation in relative abundances, likely reflecting differences in diet, climate, and local flora. Armenian data revealed distinct seasonal shifts, particularly elevated Commensalibacter in autumn and minor urban-rural differences. Pesticide treatments elicited varying responses: oxalic acid drove pronounced beta-diversity shifts; neonicotinoids had subtler effects, both primarily impacting opportunistic pathogens; and glyphosate disrupted core taxa with stronger effects in newly emerged bees under prolonged exposure. Co-abundance network analysis highlighted that the pesticide-associated community was enriched in adaptive pathways, including potential glyphosate degradation by Pseudomonas, biofilm formation, and aromatic amino acid synthesis.

These findings reaffirm the stability of the honeybee core microbiome yet underscore that environmental and anthropogenic stressors induce distinct compositional and functional shifts. We emphasize the need for longitudinal metagenomic approaches that enable high-resolution functional profiling and co-abundance network analysis to clarify how these microbiome shifts impact bee health and colony sustainability."
"Many, but not all, parasitic filarial nematodes (Onchocercidae) carry intracellular, maternally-transmitted Wolbachia symbionts, and these alphaproteobacteria are targets for anti-filarial chemotherapeutic interventions for human disease. The symbionts of Onchocercidae derive from four of the major supergroups (C, D, F and J) defined within the genus Wolbachia. Using twenty-two whole genome sequences of filarial nematodes and genome sequences of their Wolbachia partners, we have explored the evolutionary history of the nematode-Wolbachia symbiosis. We screened the nuclear genome sequences of all the nematodes for nuclear Wolbachia transfers (NUWTs), fragments of the Wolbachia genome that have been integrated into the nuclear genome.

Six species have no current Wolbachia infection. Setaria labiatopapillosa had no validated NUWTs and we interpret this to mean that this species was never infected with Wolbachia. In the other five species (Acanthocheilonema viteae, Cercopithifilaria (Ce.) johnstoni, Elaeophora elaphi, Loa (Lo.) loa and Onchocerca flexuosa) we found NUWTs, implying they have previously had and have now lost Wolbachia infections. For each NUWT locus, we identified the supergroup membership of the Wolbachia from which it originated, and found that the five Wolbachia-free species carried NUWTs derived from multiple supergroups, including a high shared rate of sequences derived from supergroup C. In Dirofilaria repens we identified a sample that carried two Wolbachia symbionts, one from supergroup C and one from supergroup F. In Dirofilaria immitis where live infection with a supergroup C Wolbachia is found, we identified NUWTs derived from an F Wolbachia, confirming that the F association predated the divergence of these Dirofilaria species. The supergroup D lineage of Wolbachia, as present in the human parasites Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi, derives from a replacement event. Madathamugadia (Md.) hiepei shows signs of multiple recent repeated endosymbiont replacement.

From these data we infer that the history of Wolbachia in onchocercid nematodes includes not only cospeciation (as present in the Onchocerca-Dirofilaria group in association with supergroup C Wolbachia) and loss (in the five Wolbachia-free species), but also frequent symbiont replacement and dual infection. This dynamic pattern is challenging to models that assume host-symbiont mutualism."
"The ageing population worldwide faces an increasing burden of age-related conditions, with Alzheimers disease being a prominent neurodegenerative concern. Drug repurposing, the practice of identifying new therapeutic applications for existing drugs, offers a promising avenue for accelerated intervention. In this study, we utilized the yeast S. cerevisiae to screen a library of 1,760 FDA-approved compounds, both with and without rapamycin, to assess potential synergistic effects on yeast growth. We identified 87 compounds that showed synergistic effect with rapamycin and caused growth defects in yeast. These compounds were further screened for their effects on paralysis in a C. elegans model of Alzheimers disease. We found that three compounds synergistically delayed paralysis in combination with rapamycin. Additionally, four other compounds delayed paralysis when tested at different concentrations. Moreover, we tested fluphenazine, an antipsychotic drug identified in our screen and found that it enhanced the overall health of treated worms. Western blot and X-34 staining confirmed that fluphenazine reduced amyloid-beta accumulation. These results indicate that repurposed drugs have significant potential to accelerate Alzheimers disease drug discovery."
"INTRODUCTIONDual cognitive-motor impairment in aging is a strong predictor of dementia, yet its effects on vulnerable gray matter regions microstructure remain unexplored.

METHODSThis study classified 582 individuals aged 36-90 into cognitive-motor impairment, isolated cognitive or motor impairment, and control groups. Microstructural differences in 27 temporal and motor-related gray matter regions and white matter tracts were assessed using DTI and mean apparent propagator (MAP-MRI), a technique well-suited for gray matter analysis.

RESULTSWe found widespread microstructural alterations in gray and white matter among individuals with dual cognitive-motor impairment. These changes were not observed in isolated cognitive or motor impairment after multiple comparisons correction.

DISCUSSIONDual cognitive-motor impairment is associated with reduced cellular density in temporal gray matter, decreased fiber coherence, and potential demyelination in white matter tracts, suggesting widespread microstructural disruption. These findings could help understand brain aging and facilitate interventions to slow neurodegeneration and delay dementia onset."
"During post-zygotic development, the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax undergoes massive programmed genome rearrangement that involves over 225,000 DNA cleavage and joining events. An Oxytricha family of Tc1/mariner transposons, known as Telomere-Bearing Elements (TBEs), encodes a transposase that has been implicated in rearrangement, but its high copy number (>34,000 paralogs) has precluded genetic strategies to investigate its DNA recognition properties directly in Oxytricha. Here, we developed a heterologous strategy to assay TBE transposase expression and activity in E. coli, revealing highly promiscuous DNA cleavage properties. Systematic ChIP-seq experiments allowed us to define the DNA binding specificities of multiple distinct transposase subfamilies, which exhibited a binding and cleavage preference for short, degenerate sequence motifs that resemble features present within the TBE transposon ends. The relaxed sequence preference is striking for autonomous transposases, which typically recognize their end sequences with strict specificity to avoid compromising host fitness. Finally, we developed a custom antibody to investigate TBE transposases in their native environment and found that they precisely localize to the developing nucleus exclusively during the rearrangement process. Collectively, this work establishes a robust heterologous workflow for the biochemical investigation of enzymes that have been repurposed for large-scale genome rearrangements."
"High throughput sequencing is a powerful tool for processing large amounts of DNA and RNA samples in batches. Proper experimental design and statistical methods are required to mitigate systematic technical factors due to differences in batches (""batch effects""), as data variation due to these non-biological factors can mask actual biological differences. We propose using anticlustering as an automated method to assign samples to balanced batches. Anticlustering effectively negates differences in (numeric and/or categorical) covariates among batches, and implements user-defined restrictions on the number of batches, the number of samples per batch, and whether to assign certain samples to the same batch (""must-link constraints""). A simulation study shows that anticlustering is better at achieving balance among batches than previous approaches. An application from the UCSF-Stanford Endometriosis Center for Discovery, Innovation, Training and Community Engagement (""ENACT"", https://enactcenter.org/) is presented as a real-life example. In the application, multiple samples provided by an individual had to be processed on the same batch, so that comparisons among different samples of the same patient were not diluted by batch effects. The novel Two Phase Must Link (2PML) anticlustering algorithm realized the must-link restrictions while simultaneously obtaining balance among batches regarding disease stage, menstrual cycle phase, case versus control sample, and clinical site. All methods presented here are accessible via the free and open source R package anticlust (https://cran.r-project.org/package=anticlust). An interactive visualization and web-based batch assignment tool are made available in the Rshiny app ""anticlust"" (https://anticlust.org/)."
"Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) is the most common hereditary peripheral neuropathy with an incidence of 1:2,500. CMT2 clinical symptoms include distal muscle weakness and atrophy, sensory loss, toe and foot deformities, with some patients presenting with reduced nerve conduction velocity. Mutations in the neurofilament light chain (NEFL) gene result in a specific form of CMT2 disease, CMT2E. NEFL encodes the protein, NF-L, one of the core intermediate filament proteins that contribute to the maintenance and stability of the axonal cytoskeleton. To better understand the underlying biology of CMT2E disease and advance the development of therapeutics, we generated a Nefl+/E397K mouse model. While the Nefl+/E397K mutation is inherited in a dominant manner, we also characterized NeflE397K/E397K mice to determine whether disease onset, progression or severity would be impacted. Consistent with CMT2E, lifespan was not altered in these novel mouse models. A longitudinal electrophysiology study demonstrated significant in vivo functional abnormalities as early as P21 in distal latency, compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude and negative area. A significant reduction in the sciatic nerve axon area, diameter, and G-ratio was also present as early as P21. Evidence of axon sprouting was observed with disease progression. Through the twelve months measured, disease became more evident in all assessments. Collectively, these results demonstrate an early and robust in vivo electrophysiological phenotype and axonal pathology, making Nefl+/E397K and NeflE397K/E397Kmice ideal for the evaluation of therapeutic approaches."
"Forced-copy-choice recombination occurs at the end of a template, differing from copy-choice recombination, which happens at internal positions. This mechanism may produce full-length genomes from fragments created by host antiviral responses. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that poliovirus (PV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) switches to an ""acceptor"" template in vitro when initiated on a heteropolymeric RNA-primed ""donor"" template. Surprisingly, recombinants showed template switching from the 3-end of the donor template. We have developed a primed-template system to study PV RdRp-catalyzed forced-copy-choice RNA recombination. PV RdRp adds a single, non-templated nucleotide to the 3-end of a blunt-ended, double-stranded RNA product, forming a ""plus-one"" intermediate essential for template switching. Non-templated addition of CMP was favored over AMP and GMP (80:20:1); UMP addition was negligible. A single basepair between the plus-one intermediate and the 3-end of the acceptor template was necessary and sufficient for template switching, which could occur without RdRp dissociation. Formation of the plus-one intermediate was rate limiting for template switching. PV RdRp also utilized synthetic, preformed intermediates, including those with UMP 3-overhangs. Reactions showed up to five consecutive template-switching events, consistent with a repair function for this form of recombination. PV RdRp may exclude UMP during forced-copy-choice RNA recombination to preclude creation of nonsense mutations during RNA fragment assembly. Several other picornaviral RdRps were evaluated, and all were capable of RNA fragment assembly to some extent. Lastly, we propose a structure-based hypothesis for the PV RdRp-plus-one intermediate complex based on an elongating PV RdRp structure."
"We developed Standardised Minimum 3D Distance (SM3DD), an entirely cell segmentation/annotation-free approach to the analysis of spatial RNA datasets, using it to compare lung tissue from 16 clinically normal individuals to those of 18 SARS-CoV-2 patients who died from acute respiratory distress syndrome. RNA spatial coordinates were determined using the CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager (Bruker Spatial Biology, US). For each individual transcript location, we calculated the three-dimensional distances to the nearest transcript of each transcript type, standardising the distances to each transcript type. Mean SM3DDs were compared between normal and SARS-CoV-2 patients. Notably, hierarchical clustering of the directional log10(P) values organized genes by functionality, making it easier to interpret biological contexts and for FKBP11, where a decrease in distance to MZT2A was the most significant difference, suggesting a role in interferon signaling. Using a segmented principal components analysis of the entire SM3DD dataset, we identified multiple pathways, including  SARS-CoV-2 infection, even though the assay did not include any SARS-CoV-2 transcripts."
"Subcellular compartmentalization enables cells to concentrate and locally regulate functions. Here we find that translational machinery is compartmentalized to the cell cortex in epidermal cells. Furthermore, we observed broad enrichment of transcripts at the cortex, establishing a novel axis of mRNA organization in these cells. Mechanistically, we identified the desmosomal protein, desmoplakin, to be essential for cortical recruitment of both ribosomes and mRNAs, through distinct mechanisms. While mRNA localization is usually proposed to promote local translation, we found that most cortical transcripts were translationally repressed. These findings reveal spatial and transcript-dependent features of the cortical translatome. One mediator of this regulation is the RNA-induced Silencing Complex (RISC) which is also cortically enriched in a desmoplakin-dependent manner. Under homeostatic conditions, cortical RISC associates with transcripts for cell adhesion and the cytoskeleton. Upon wounding RISC is delocalized from the cortex and its associated transcripts become translationally upregulated. Together our data demonstrate a desmosome-dependent cortical compartmentalization of translation that dynamically responds to barrier perturbations, including wounding."
"Emerging evidence has challenged the traditional view of a single-region origin for Homo sapiens, suggesting instead that our species arose and diversified across multiple geographically distinct populations in Africa, which intermittently exchanged genes and culture. However, our understanding of how this Pan-African metapopulation would have changed through time is still limited. Further, the drivers of such changes are uncertain, and quantitative models of the respective contribution of different African regions are lacking. Here we provide a complete reconstruction of the meta-population dynamics over the last 200,000 years by quantitatively integrating an environmental niche model based on archaeological sites within a spatially explicit population genetic framework. The inferred metapopulation dynamics not only fully explains the divergence among all available contemporary and ancient genomes of African hunter-gatherers, which were used to calibrate the model, but also accurately predicts the patterns of craniometric diversification across the continent from the Middle Pleistocene to the present. Furthermore, we show how the climate-driven changes in population sizes and connectivity predict major patterns of archaeological and phenotypic diversification over the last 200,000 years across the African continent."
"Cellular membranes orchestrate critical processes such as molecular transport and signal transduction, both regulated by the lateral mobility of lipids and proteins. However, resolving nanoscale diffusional heterogeneities and elucidating their underlying mechanisms remains a formidable challenge due to the membranes intricate architecture and compositional diversity. Here, we present point-cloud single-molecule diffusivity mapping (pc-SMdM), a cutting-edge super-resolution technique that offers a point-cloud data format with enhanced spatial resolution for diffusivity mapping. Using pc-SMdM, we visualize nanoscale diffusion slowdown clusters with [~]50 nm in diameter on plasma membranes. These clusters are predominantly governed by cholesterol content, alongside contributions from membrane protein assemblies and topographical features. Leveraging two-color pc-SMdM, we concurrently imaged multiple lipids and membrane probes, revealing distinct ""fingerprint"" diffusivity maps shaped by their interactions within lipid bilayers. Our findings position pc-SMdM as a transformative tool for spatially resolving molecular interactions and membrane dynamics in live cells, offering new insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern membrane mobility at the nanoscale."
"Systematic mapping of protein-ligand interactions is essential for understanding biological processes and drug mechanisms. Peptide-centric local stability assay (PELSA) is a powerful tool for detecting these interactions and localizing potential binding sites. However, its original workflow is limited in throughput, sample compatibility and accessible protein targets. Here, we introduce a high-throughput adaptation - HT-PELSA - that increases sample processing efficiency 100-fold while maintaining high sensitivity and reproducibility. HT-PELSA substantially extends the capabilities of the original method by enabling sensitive protein-ligand profiling in crude cell, tissue and bacterial lysates, making it possible to identify membrane protein targets in diverse biological systems. We demonstrate that HT-PELSA can precisely and accurately determine binding affinities of small molecule inhibitors, sensitively detect direct and allosteric ATP binding, and reveal off-target interactions of a marketed kinase inhibitor in heart tissue. By enhancing scalability, reducing costs, and enabling system-wide drug screening across a wide range of sample types, HT-PELSA - when combined with next-generation mass spectrometry - offers a powerful platform poised to accelerate both drug discovery and basic biological research."
"The glial tube is a longitudinal structure predominantly composed of densely bundled, aligned astrocytes that projects from subventricular zone (SVZ) to olfactory bulb. Neural precursor cells (NPCs) generated in the SVZ migrate through this glial tube - referred to as the rostral migratory stream (RMS) - to replace olfactory bulb interneurons in the mammalian brain. RMS astrocytes have distinct morphological and functional characteristics facilitating their unique purpose as an endogenous living scaffold directing NPC migration and maturation. However, the transcriptomic factors underlying these unique structure-function attributes versus standard stellate astrocytes have not been examined. We previously developed biofabrication techniques to create the first tissue-engineered rostral migratory stream (TE-RMS) that replicates key features of the glial tube in vivo. We have shown that TE-RMS astrocytes exhibit elongated nuclei, longitudinally aligned intermediate filaments, and enrichment of key functional proteins - cytoarchitectural and surface features characteristic of native RMS astrocytes. In the current study, we performed RNAseq on TE-RMS astrocytes in comparison to planar astrocyte cultures to identify gene expression patterns that may underlie their profound morphological and functional differences. Remarkably, we found 4008 differentially expressed genes in TE-RMS astrocytes, with 2076 downregulated (e.g. LOC690251, ccn5) and 1932 upregulated (e.g. lrrc45, cntn1) compared to planar astrocytes. Moreover, there were 256 downregulated and 91 upregulated genes with >3-fold change. We also conducted analyses of gene sets related to cytoskeleton and nuclear structure, revealing greatest enrichment of actin-related components. Overall, the TE-RMS offers a platform to study interplay between transcriptomic and cytoarchitectural dynamics in a unique astrocyte population."
"With the development of sequencing technologies, chromosome-level genome assemblies have become increasingly common across various organisms, including non-model species. BLAST+ is one of the most widely used bioinformatics tools for computing sequence alignments, offering numerous optimizations for speed and scalability. Dot plots, which visualize the similarity between two sequences, are widely used in biological research. However, while many dot plot-generating programs exist, most rely on their own alignment algorithms, and it is uncommon to visualize external BLAST results directly.

Here, we present Dotplotic, a lightweight Perl program that generates dot plot-like visualizations based on BLAST output in tabular format. Dotplotic visualizes each alignment as a line connecting the start and end points of the query and subject sequences, with a gradient color indicating sequence identity. It allows users to overlay annotation data from external files onto the plot. Although command-line-based, Dotplotic requires only core Perl modules and is implemented as a single script, making it easy to install and run across platforms. The program supports standard input for both BLAST results and annotation files, enabling flexible visualization under various conditions, such as filtering specific alignments or displaying selected genomic features like genes or repeats.

Dotplotic is an efficient, portable, and easy-to-use visualization tool that enhances the exploration of sequence alignments and serves as a valuable resource for both bioinformatics and broader biological research."
"How do related proteins with a common fold perform diverse biological functions? Although the average structure may be similar, structural excursions from this average may differ, giving rise to allosteric rewiring that enables differential activity and regulation. However, this idea has been difficult to test in detail. Here we used the qFit algorithm to model ""hidden"" alternate conformations from electron density maps for an entire protein family, the Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (PTPs), spanning 26 enzymes and 221 structures. To interrogate these multiconformer models, we developed a new algorithm, Residue Interaction Networks From Alternate conformations In RElated structures (RINFAIRE), that calculates networks of interactions between flexible residues and quantitatively compares them. We show that PTPs share a common allosteric network which rewires dynamically in response to catalytic loop motions or active-site vs. allosteric ligand binding, but also that individual PTPs have unique allosteric signatures. As experimental validation, we show that targeted mutations at residues with varying sequence conservation but high network connectivity modulate enzyme catalysis, including a surprising enhancement of activity. Overall, our work provides new tools for understanding how evolution has recycled modular macromolecular building blocks to diversify biological function. RINFAIRE is available at https://github.com/keedylab/rinfaire."
"High-frequency animal tracks must often be subsampled to allow a simple analysis of the movement on the most meaningful scale for the respective study. One way of achieving this is to identify  biologically significant turns, compared to heading changings caused by  noise. Many  turn identification methods have been developed, but the accuracy and consistency of such methods have rarely been validated against ground truth trajectories with known true turns and noise. We analyze simulated tracks with known parameters as well as two empirical tracks and identify turns with 10 different frequently used resampling methods. We assess the specificity and sensitivity of identifying the location of turns and compare the known mean step length and turn angle of the paths with the resampled trajectories. We found great accuracy differences between, and sometimes within, methods, even on simulated tracks of the same characteristics. Results of some methods were also highly sensitive to the user-set threshold the method requires (e.g. max angle). Overall, the best-performing methods in this study were DP and MRPA, methods used in human mobility research, and TPA, which is mostly used in primate research. We thus advise caution when comparing results of studies using different resampling methods and recommend justifying the use of the resampling method in addition to quantifying the sensitivity of results to the threshold value. This study is also an appeal to authors of novel turn identification methods to consider thorough comparisons in different scenarios with a wide range of previous methods, including those developed outside the movement ecology discipline."
"O_LIBiological invasions are a major threat to global biodiversity, particularly on oceanic islands and their unique and fragile biotas. However, the complexity of the processes underlying invasions has prevented the identification of general patterns explaining why some plant species successfully establish and spread beyond their native ranges.
C_LIO_LIWe investigated Darwins naturalization conundrum in the most species-rich angiosperm family of the Canary Islands, considering two invasion stages across two spatial scales. Using a high-resolution phylogeny covering the Asteraceae species from the archipelago and functional traits measured from fresh specimens, we calculated phylogenetic and functional distances of invasive and noninvasive introduced species to natives.
C_LIO_LIOur findings reveal that successful introduced Asteraceae species were phylogenetically distant from native relatives, with invasive species even more distantly related than noninvasive introduced species to their closest native relative. Functionally, noninvasive species were distinct, while invasive species showed unexpected similarity to native species. These patterns were consistent across spatial scales.
C_LIO_LIThis study underscores the importance of a multidimensional approach to understanding plant invasion success. Identifying key patterns driving biological invasions is crucial for developing effective strategies against future ecological disruptions on islands.

"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents with diverse and heterogenous cutaneous manifestations. However, the molecular and immunologic pathways driving specific cutaneous manifestations of SLE are poorly understood. Here, we leverage transcriptomics from a large well-phenotyped longitudinal cohort of SLE patients to map molecular pathways linked to ten distinct SLE-related rashes. Through whole blood and immune cell-sorted bulk RNA sequencing, we identified immune signatures specific to cutaneous subtypes of SLE. Subacute cutaneous lupus (SCLE) exhibited broad upregulation of type I interferon, TNF-, and IL6-JAK-STAT3, pathways suggesting potential unique therapeutic responses to JAK and type I interferon inhibition. While interferon signaling is prominent in SCLE, discoid lupus, and acute lupus, it is unexpectedly absent in patients with skin and mucosal ulcers. Pathway and cell-type enrichment analysis revealed unexpected roles for CD14+ monocytes in photosensitivity of SLE and NK cells in alopecia, mucosal ulceration, and livedo reticularis. These findings illuminate the immune heterogeneity of rashes in SLE, highlighting subtype-specific mechanistic targets, and presenting opportunities to identify precision therapies for SLE-associated skin phenotypes."
"Loss of keratin 8 (K8) has been shown to increase susceptibility towards colonocyte hyperproliferation and tumorigenesis. However, most colorectal cancer (CRC) mouse models require carcinogen, develop small intestinal tumors or have long latency period. The aim was to establish a genetic, colon-specific and more human like CRC model driven by loss of K8 and Apc. Colon epithelium specific targeting using the CDX2P-CreERT2 mice was used to generate K8flox/flox; CDX2P-CreERT2 and K8flox/flox; CDX2P-CreERT2; Apcflox/+ mice. Body weight and stool consistency were monitored, and colon was analyzed for tumor burden and histopathology. Keratin expression, inflammation, and proliferation were assessed using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis. This data was compared to K8 expression analysis in patients with CRC using UALCAN database. K8 downregulation in adult K8flox/flox; CDX2P-CreERT2 mice triggers mild diarrhea and leads to loss of K8 and reduced partner keratin levels in a mosaic pattern in the colonic epithelium, while ileal K8 protein levels are unchanged. K8-negative colon areas display increased crypt loss and more MPO+ cells predominantly in the proximal colon. Increased colonocyte proliferation is observed as increased percentage of Ki67+ cells and lower IL-22BP protein levels throughout the colon. These mice with additional monoallelic Apc inactivation show increased colon tumor formation. In colon adenocarcinoma patients, K8 expression is decreased independent of disease type and stage, age or gender. New genetic and colon-specific mouse model with loss of K8 and Apc adequately resembles human CRC. This study also highlights a role of colonocyte K8 in maintaining colon epithelial integrity and protecting against colon tumorigenesis."
"New species typically evolve over several million years1. However, rates of speciation and ecological diversification vary by orders of magnitude across the tree of life1-3, with the fastest shown by some adaptive radiations. Eight hundred endemic species of cichlid fishes emerged and formed entire food webs in Lake Victoria and nearby lakes in East Africa. According to Victorias paleolimnological history4, five hundred may have arisen within the past 16,700 years, but molecular phylogenies estimated a much older origin5-8. We reconstruct the age and demography of all Lake Victoria region radiations from whole genomes. We show that indeed, in Lake Victoria all trophic guilds diverged <16,700 years ago, corresponding to between 537 and nearly 30000 speciation events per species per million years, the fastest speciation rate in metazoans1,2. Cichlid radiations in lakes Edward, Albert and Kivu too began <20,000 years ago, an order of magnitude faster than previously thought. Evolutionary transitions between trophic levels led to divergence in effective population sizes as predicted by the trophic pyramid of numbers concept9 and replicated across three parallel food web radiations. Our results demonstrate that classical theory of trophic interactions in ecologically assembled food webs applies equally to food webs that assembled through rapid adaptive radiation."
"Resistance training (RT) promotes muscle protein accretion and myofiber hypertrophy, driven by dynamic processes of protein synthesis and degradation. While molecular studies have focused on acute signalling or long-term hypertrophy and strength gains, a critical gap remains in understanding the intermediate processes of muscle adaptation. Acute signalling does not always correlate directly with long-term outcomes, highlighting the need for a time-course analysis of protein abundance and turnover rates. To address this, we utilised deuterium oxide labelling and peptide mass spectrometry to quantify absolute protein content and synthesis rates in skeletal muscle. A daily programmed resistance training regimen was applied to the rat tibialis anterior (TA) via electrical stimulation of the left hind limb for 10, 20, and 30 days (5 sets of 10 repetitions daily). Muscle samples from stimulated (Stim) and contralateral control (Ctrl) limbs were analysed, quantifying 658 protein abundances and 215 protein synthesis rates. Unsupervised temporal clustering of protein responses revealed distinct phases of muscle adaptation, with early (0-10 days) and mid (10-20 days) responses driven by differential protein accretion rates in ribosomal and mitochondrial networks, respectively. These findings suggest that subsets of proteins exhibit distinct adaptation timelines due to variations in translation and/or degradation rates. A deeper understanding of these temporal shifts could improve strategies for optimising muscle growth and functional adaptation to resistance training."
"Crop root traits that modulate the soil microbiome can turn the tide of reduced fertility in intensively farmed land by optimising nutrient availability and resilience to environmental stresses. Advantageous genetic diversity that allows adaptation to nutrient availability is present in historic crop genotypes. The Watkins collection of bread wheat landraces is an unexploited resource, carrying untapped phenotypic traits. Here, we show that the rhizosphere microbiome assembly of these landraces is distinct compared to elite varieties, specifically those that come from ancestral groups (AGs) not used in modern breeding.

We used 16S rRNA sequencing to identify changes in microbial communities of rhizosphere soil collected from 81 landraces and two elite varieties. We found high similarity in microbiome recruitment between the elite cultivars and the two AGs genetically closest to the elite. The rhizosphere microbiome of five AGs genetically distant from the elite cultivars showed significant differences in the abundance of taxa involved in nitrogen and carbon turnover, keystone taxa and associations within the microbial network. Our findings suggest that genes to recruit or suppress microbial taxa in the rhizosphere are shared by landraces from these AGs. Selective breeding for traits to control microbial functions can enhance soil productivity and crop performance."
"The abundance and composition of transposable elements (TEs) varies widely across species, yet the evolutionary forces shaping this diversity remain poorly understood. Using 285 recently published genomes from drosophilid species, we investigated the evolutionary origins of the {approx}130 TE families present in D. melanogaster and found that 79 were exchanged via horizontal transposon transfer (HTT) with other drosophilids.

Most HTT events involved closely related species such as D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. teissieri, although transfers from more distantly related taxa were also observed. Notably, D. melanogaster appears to be a net recipient of HTTs, acquiring about three times as many TEs as it donated.

Geographic patterns reveal that most HTTs involved Afrotropical species, reflecting D. melanogaster  s ancestral range, with fewer involving species from the Neotropics, a region which D. melanogaster invaded only {approx}200 years ago. Despite colonizing the Nearctic, Australasian, and Palearctic regions between 200-2000 years ago, we found no evidence of HTT with species from those areas.

Nonetheless, an analysis of drosophilids from each biogeographic realm shows that HTT is widespread in each realm, with 3-55% of the genome in each species derived from HTT. Strikingly, a considerable portion of the genome is shared among all species inhabiting the same realm --regardless of phylogenetic distance--indicating that geographic overlap, rather than shared ancestry, is a primary driver of TE composition. These findings highlight biogeography as a major force shaping the TE landscape and underscore the importance of ecological interactions in genome evolution."
"BackgroundStreptococcus pneumoniae is a leading pathogen in terms of deaths attributable to or associated with antimicrobial resistance globally. Thus, monitoring antibiotic resistance determinants constitutes a key aspect of surveillance efforts.

AimLeveraging on publicly available whole-genome sequencing data, we aimed to investigate the presence and distribution patterns of antibiotic resistance in S. pneumoniae with a focus on multi-drug resistance and serotype distribution.

MethodsMetadata and genomes were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Pathogen Detection database. Curation and harmonization were performed in R and SPSS. Data on resistance patterns was defined according to AMRFinderPlus and a combination of prediction tools were employed for in silico serotyping.

ResultsAnalyses involved 75,161 genomes totaling 122,673 gene/allele counts from 14 antibiotic classes. Multi-drug resistance was observed in 16.7% of isolates with the highest increasing rates in Asia and South America. Within antibiotic classes, increase in macrolide resistance genes was highlighted, particularly in the proportion of genomes presenting mefA/msrD. Over a third of isolates with serotypes 19F, 23F, 15A, 6B, and 19A showed multi-drug resistance. We further observed the highest significant increases in the presence of resistance in 33F, 22F, 10A, and 23A. Serotype 13, not included in any vaccine formulation, presented high multi-drug resistance rates with a strong increasing trend.

ConclusionsThe findings of this study highlight variations in resistance determinants globally and across serotypes over time. Collectively these data underscore the added value of utilizing public whole-genome sequencing data to investigate the effectiveness and repercussions of treatment and vaccination strategies on managing antibiotic resistance."
"While numerous researchers claim that the minimization of prediction error (PE) is a general force underlying most brain functions, others argue instead that PE minimization drives low-level, sensory-related neuronal computations but not high-order, abstract cognitive operations. We investigated this issue using behavioral, fMRI, and EEG data. Studies 1A/1B examined semantic- and reward-processing PE using task-fMRI, yielding converging evidence of PEs global effects on large-scale connectivity: high-PE states broadly upregulated ventral-dorsal connectivity, and low-PE states upregulated posterior-anterior connectivity. Investigating whether these global patterns characterize cognition generally, Studies 2A/2B used resting-state fMRI and showed that individuals continuously fluctuate between ventral-dorsal (high-PE) and posterior-anterior (low-PE) dynamic connectivity states. Additionally, individual differences in PE task responses track differences in resting-state fluctuations, further endorsing that these fluctuations represent PE minimization at rest. Finally, Study 3 used combined fMRI-EEG and showed that these resting-state ventral-dorsal and posterior-anterior PE networks specifically oscillate at 3-6 Hz. This whole-brain layout and timeline together speak to high/low-PE fluctuations playing a role in integrative and general sub-second cognitive operations."
"Vestibular dysfunction constitutes a major medical concern, and regeneration of hair cells (HC) is a primary target of gene therapy aimed at restoring vestibular functions. Thus far, therapeutic trials in animal models targeting vestibular loss associated with genetic diseases have yielded variable and partial results, and the functional identity and quantity of HCs required to restore minimal or normal vestibular function remain undefined. Indeed, direct comparisons between structural pathology and quantitative assessments vestibular dysfunctions quantifications are lacking in humans and are rather limited in animal models, representing a significant gap in current knowledge. Here, we present an innovative methodology to bridge the gap between HC integrity and functional vestibular loss in individuals. Gradual vestibular deficits were induced through a dose-dependent ototoxic insult, quantified with canal or utricular-specific vestibulo-ocular reflex tests, and were then correlated in all individuals with the loss of type I and type II HCs in different regions of ampulla and macula. Our findings reveal that the structure-function relationship is nonlinear, with lower bound of approximately 50% of HCs necessary to retain minimal vestibular function, and threshold exceeding 80% to preserve normal function, thus shedding light on population coding mechanisms for vestibular response. Our data further support the decisive role of type I, rather than type II, HC in the tested VOR functions."
"AimSpecies occurrence patterns are typically analysed using data-randomisation approaches, which reveal when observed patterns deviate from random expectation, but give little insight why. Mechanistic models, such as neutral models, have been proposed as an alternative null model, but they are computationally expensive. Here, we use an efficient method to simulate such models and to explore likely mechanisms governing the occurrence patterns of birds on islands.

LocationRiau archipelago, Indonesia.

TaxonBirds.

MethodsWe used species richness and island area data to fit a niche-neutral model, where species obey neutral dynamics within non-overlapping discrete niches. We used a sequential sampling algorithm that can efficiently generate randomised presence- absence matrices under the niche-neutral model and used mismatches to identify which mechanisms were potentially important to occurrence patterns.

ResultsBirds were more segregated and less nested than expected from both data randomisation and the niche-neutral model. The niche-neutral model reproduced the mean relationship between island size and species richness, but it could not produce sufficient variability to account for the richness data. The model was brought into closer agreement with the data by allowing niche diversity to vary across islands (increased segregation) and allowing the per-capita immigration rate to vary across islands (decreased nestedness).

Main conclusionWhile the species-area relationship could be explained by a model with constant per-capita immigration rates and number of niches across islands, interisland heterogeneity was needed to explain higher-order metrics of nestedness and cooccurrence patterns. The sequential sampling algorithm allowed us to explore different scenarios efficiently, and our approach may be useful for identifying the mechanisms structuring occurrence patterns in other systems.

"Illumina DNA methylation arrays are frequently used for the discovery of methylation signatures associated with aging and disease. One of the major hurdles to overcome when training trait prediction models is the high dimensionality of the data, with the number of features (CpGs) greatly exceeding the typical number of samples assessed. In addition, most large-scale DNA methylation-based studies do not include replicate measurements for a given sample, making it impossible to estimate the degree of measurement uncertainty or the reliability of the prediction models. A recent study proposed that training penalized regression models on derived principal components (PCs) rather than on the original features (CpGs) results in more reliable age predictions, as estimated from technical replication. Moreover, the same method could be applied for predicting other phenotypes more reliably. Here, we aimed at validating the proposed PC method. We found that although dimension reduction with PCA consistently led to small improvements in the reliability of age prediction models, it severely compromised their accuracy. PC-based models needed far larger training set sizes to be similarly accurate as CpG-based models, whereas reliability did not depend on the sample size of the training set data for either approach. Finally, the PC version of a novel multiclass predictor for breast, ovarian and endometrial cancer we trained using weighted ensembles of deep-learning models also had a markedly lower predictive accuracy compared to a CpG version, suggesting limited applicability of the proposed PC method for predicting phenotypes beyond age."
"F-box proteins are the substrate recognition modules of the SCF (SKP1-Cullin- F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. FBXO42, an understudied member of this family, has recently emerged as a modulator of key cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA damage response and glioma stem cell survival. In this study, we define the function of FBXO42 as a major regulator of the protein phosphatase PP4. Phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPPs) have a broad array of substrates, hence necessitating tight regulation. We observe that FBXO42 ubiquitinates the PP4 complex to govern the assembly of regulatory and catalytic subunits with the net effect of restraining the latters phosphatase activity. FBXO42 depletion unleashes PP4 activity with broad cellular effects highlighting FBXO42 as a novel regulatory node in ubiquitin-mediated signalling for future therapeutic exploitation.

Impact StatementFBXO42 is a major regulator of PP4 phosphatase impacting multiple cellular phenotypes."
"One of the greatest challenges when generating large and/or high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) volume electron microscopy (vEM) datasets is long acquisition times. We developed a method that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to increase acquisition throughput for 3D datasets by creating an AI-derived mask for the targeted region of interest, referred to as Adaptive Scanning. This allowed for specific structures to be imaged at high resolution, with the surrounding area captured at lower resolution, without artificially generating or enhancing any raw data. We demonstrate that this dynamic-resolution scanning approach significantly reduced volume acquisition time across a diverse array of organisms and tissues, including brains, parasites, cultured cells, and plants. This multi-resolution strategy has the potential to enhance Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy and other forms of vEM, by increasing time savings by up to 2-fold or more, enabling routine generation of multiple and/or larger vEM datasets, more efficiently and cost-effectively, allowing more data collection for increase statistical power for comparative studies."
"Identification of new therapeutic targets in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains critical. Chromatin regulating complexes are frequently mutated or aberrantly expressed in HCC, suggesting dysregulation of chromatin environments is a key feature driving liver cancer. To investigate whether the altered chromatin state in HCC cells could be targeted, we designed and utilized an epigenome-focused CRISPR library that targets genes involved in chromatin regulation. This focused approach allowed us to test multiple HCC cell lines in both 2D and 3D growth conditions, which revealed striking differences in the essentiality of genes involved in ubiquitination and multiple chromatin regulators vital for HCC cell survival in 2D but whose loss promoted growth in 3D. We found the core subunits of the menin-MLL1 complex among the strongest essential genes for HCC survival in all screens and thoroughly characterized the mechanism through which the menin-MLL1 complex promotes HCC cell growth. Inhibition of the menin-MLL1 interaction led to global changes in occupancy of the complex with concomitant decreases in H3K4me3 and expression of genes involved in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Menin inhibition affected chromatin accessibility in HCC cells, revealing that increased chromatin accessibility at sites not bound by menin-MLL1 was associated with the recruitment of the pioneer transcription factor complex NF-Y. A CRISPR/Cas9 screen of chromatin regulators in the presence of menin inhibitor SNDX-5613 revealed a significantly increased cell death when combined with NFYB knockout. Together these data show that menin-MLL1 is necessary for HCC cell survival and cooperates with NF-Y to regulate oncogenic gene transcription."
"Determining the origin of high catalytic efficiency of enzymes has been a central goal in biochemical research. But our understanding of the mechanisms by which enzymes achieve enormous rate enhancements is still incomplete. One of wildly accepted strategies to achieve rate enhancements by enzymes is to position catalytic residues precisely in enzyme-substrate complexes and form reactive conformations for catalysis. Such catalytic strategy through positioning may also serve as the basis for transition state stabilization. Although considerable efforts have been made to determine relationships between enzyme activities and the formation of reactive conformations of enzyme-substrate complexes, there is considerable uncertainty concerning the ability of enzymes to preserve reactive conformations during enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The failure of properly maintaining reactive conformations during reactions may prevent residues from exerting catalytic effects and lead to significant reductions of activities. Here QM/MM MD and free energy simulations are performed for CARNMT1 to determine the importance and requirements for preservation of catalytic competent reactive conformations during enzyme-catalyzed reactions. For CARNMT1, the existence of wild-type reactive conformation is directly related to the conformation of His347. Therefore, the conformation of His347 can be used to monitor preservation or collapse of the reactive conformation during catalysis. It is found that for wild-type the reactive conformation can not only be formed in the enzyme-substrate complex but also be preserved well after the reaction passes TS. For the Tyr386Ala, Tyr396Asp and Tyr398Ala mutants, the wild-type like reactive conformations can be formed in the mutant-substrate complexes but collapse in the early stage of reaction. Such pre-mature collapse of the reactive conformation in the mutants prevents the residues to fully exert catalytic effects and leads to a significant reduction of catalytic efficiency. The results suggest that the ability of enzymes to preserve reactive conformations with well-positioned catalytic residues during enzyme-catalyzed reactions can be an important factor for efficient catalysis, and this property of enzymes deserves attention."
"Microbial symbioses are fundamental to the nutrition of many animal groups, yet the mechanisms of nutrient provisioning remain poorly understood -- even in social insects, a diverse clade whose global ecological dominance and sophisticated caste systems make them disproportionately well-studied models for symbiosis research. Here, we investigate the functional significance of a specialized and unusual symbiotic organ-- the bacterial pouch--in four ant species within the Tetraponera nigra-group, focusing on the symbionts roles in nitrogen recycling and colony fitness. Bacterial pouch houses a microbial community consistently dominated by the core bacterial symbiont Tokpelaia. Metagenomic sequencing and targeted {superscript 1}N-labeled urea feeding experiments demonstrate that these symbionts assimilate nitrogen from urea into amino acids, transferring them to adult workers and developing larvae that incorporate recycled nitrogen into their tissues. Disruption of this nitrogen-recycling symbiosis severely impairs larval growth and overall colony fitness. Our study highlights the critical role of the bacterial pouch in sustaining colony fitness in nitrogen-limited environments, providing new insights into the pivotal role of microbial symbioses in the ecological success of social insects."
"BackgroundErythroid cells can be generated from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) derived from various sources; however, few studies decode ex vivo human erythropoiesis for the discrepancies at single-cell multi-omics resolution and uncover the underlying restraints for erythrocyte regeneration.

ResultsWe deciphered ex vivo human erythropoiesis at two differentiation states from three sources at single-cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomes level. We identified detrimental myeloid differentiation tendencies during early differentiation. These tendencies were linked to low glutamine activity in cord blood- and iPSC-derived erythropoiesis. The erythroid progenitor differentiation is restricted by cell cycle and hypoxia signaling deficiencies, which are pronounced in the iPSC-derived erythropoiesis. We delineated the erythroid differentiation trajectory of various ex vivo erythropoiesis systems, and revealed a distinct roadmap from HSC to orthochromatic erythroblast with unprecedented resolution. The integrative analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptome across developmental stages uncovered a dynamic coordination, and highlighted the pivotal role of chromatin accessibility and associated enhancers in regulating ex vivo erythropoiesis. Cell-cell communications in the ex vivo erythropoiesis system were not as well established as those in the BM, suggesting that modulating cell-cell communication signals in distinct ex vivo erythropoiesis system may facilitate erythrocyte regeneration.

ConclusionsThis study comprehensively characterized the discrepancies and constraints in ex vivo human erythropoiesis at single-cell multi-omics resolution, offering novel strategies to overcome these constraints. These insights are critical for advancing functional erythrocyte generation and have significant implications for clinical applications."
"ANKZF1, the human orthologue of yeast Vms1, is a multi-domain cytosolic protein. Occasionally, the protein is also found in mitochondria, although the reason for its mitochondrial localization and the mechanism of its mitochondrial targeting remains unclear. Despite the absence of any predicted Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence or Domain (MTS/MTD) in the protein, ANKZF1 possesses multiple internal Matrix-targeting sequence-like sequences (iMTS-Ls). In this study, we show that ANKZF1s N-terminal 73 residues negatively regulate its mitochondrial targeting. Interestingly, 1-72-ANKZF1 peptide hinders the mitochondrial targeting of {Delta}73-ANKZF1 upon co-expression. Using a series of truncation mutants of ANKZF1, we further show that iMTS-Ls constituted by residues 231-240 of ANKZF1 is indispensable for its mitochondrial localization. The sequence of 231-240 residues is extremely conserved across different organisms, indicating the importance of this segment for conditional mitochondrial targeting of the protein. Importantly, 231-324 residues containing two consecutive predicted iMTS-Ls constitute an independent mitochondrial signal sequence and can target Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to mitochondria when fused to N-terminus. Further, by Molecular Dynamic simulation, we show that the deletion of N-terminal 74 amino acids of ANKZF1 leads to a massive structural rearrangement within the protein leading to the opening of its C-terminal part and solvent exposure of the 231-240 residues. We posit that these structural rearrangements and exposure of the internal mitochondrial targeting sequence in the absence of N-terminal segment of ANKZF1 leads to its mitochondrial translocation."
"The organ of Corti is divided into functional compartments responsible for hearing or cochlear amplification. A medial compartment containing inner hair cells innervated by Type I spiral ganglion neurons and a lateral compartment containing outer hair cells innervated by Type II spiral ganglion neurons. Supporting cells also differ, with lateral compartment pillar cells and Deiters cells developing specialized cellular structures to support outer hair cell electromotility. We bred organ of Corti-restricted Prox1 conditional knockout mice to study lateral compartment development because PROX1 is the first transcription factor expressed strictly in lateral compartment supporting cells. In the absence of Prox1, supporting cell numbers increased without corresponding changes in outer hair cells, and they appear incompletely differentiated based on morphological criteria. Outer hair cell number was not impacted but innervation was disrupted with many afferent neurons turning incorrectly towards the cochlear apex. RNAseq revealed no changes in gene expression that could account for the innervation phenotype. Therefore, we propose that PROX1 promotes pillar and Deiters cell differentiation and organization that has secondary effects on innervation but is not required for compartment specification."
"Iron is an essential trace element required by nearly all organisms as a cofactor in enzymes, regulatory proteins, and cytochromes of the respiratory chain. Maintaining iron homeostasis is crucial, since elevated levels cause oxidative stress through the formation of reactive oxygen species. In Corynebacterium glutamicum, iron and heme homeostasis are tightly interconnected and controlled by the global regulators DtxR and HrrA. While DtxR senses intracellular Fe2+, the two-component system HrrSA is activated by heme, functioning as a global regulator of heme homeostasis. This study provides the first genome-wide analysis of DtxR and HrrA binding dynamics under varying iron and heme conditions using chromatin affinity purification sequencing (ChAP-seq). Our conditional ChAP-Seq approach revealed 25 novel DtxR targets and 210 previously unrecognized HrrA targets. Among these, metH, encoding homocysteine methyltransferase, and xerC, encoding a tyrosine recombinase, were bound by DtxR exclusively under heme conditions, underscoring condition-dependent variation in DtxR binding. Activation of metH by DtxR links iron metabolism to methionine synthesis, potentially relevant for the mitigation of oxidative stress. Beyond novel targets, this study highlights the interconnected nature of the DtxR and HrrA regulons, identifying 16 shared targets with in some cases overlapping operator sequences. Strikingly, we provide several examples for weak ChAP-Seq peaks, often disregarded in global approaches, that feature a significant impact of the regulator on differential gene expression. These findings emphasize the importance of genome-wide profiling under different conditions to uncover novel targets and shed light on the complexity and dynamic nature of bacterial regulatory networks."
"Long oligomer sequences, rich in guanine and cytosine, such as c-kit1 and the HIV-1 LTR-III sequence, are prevalent in oncogenes and retroviruses and play crucial roles in cancer. Understanding the conformational dynamics of such guanine quadruplexes and identifying druggable regions are therefore essential for developing new inhibition strategies. In this study, we used extensive AMOEBA polarizable force field molecular dynamics simulations combined with data-driven adaptive sampling and clustering algorithms, reaching a cumulative simulation time of 7.5 {micro}s for c-kit1. Such simulations identified novel structural motives and show-cased the flexible loop dynamics, as well as the role of polarizable water in transient stabilization of the G-quadruplex. They also identified two druggable pockets in c-kit1. The 400 ns simulation of the HIV-1 LTR-III sequence confirmed its quadruplex stability and uncovered a potentially druggable cryptic pocket.

"Pollen is a male gametophyte of angiosperms. Following meiosis, the microspore undergoes an asymmetric division called pollen mitosis I (PMI), which produces two cells of different sizes: a large vegetative cell and a small generative cell. Polarized nuclear migration and positioning during PMI are important for successful pollen development and cell differentiation. However, analyzing the pollen development process in real-time is challenging in many model plants with tricellular pollen, including Arabidopsis and rice. In this study, we established a method for live confocal imaging of microtubule and actin dynamics using suspension cultures with biolistic delivery of plasmid DNAs during PMI in Nicotiana benthamiana (Benthams tobacco), containing bicellular pollen. Pharmacological studies have indicated that actin filaments are crucial for microspore nuclear positioning before PMI, cell plate expansion during cytokinesis, and chromatin dispersion in vegetative cell nucleus after PMI. By contrast, inhibition of microtubule assembly resulted in abnormal chromosome segregation and nuclear behavior after PMI, although nuclear positioning and asymmetric division were observed. Our in vitro live cell imaging system for PMI provides insights into the importance of cytoskeletal regulation in asymmetric division and differentiation during pollen development."
"1. BackgroundParasitoid-host interactions are key drivers of insect community structure, with host concealment influencing parasitoid diversity and parasitism rates. However, the effectiveness of different host defense strategies against parasitoids remains insufficiently understood.

2. ObjectiveThis study examines how host concealment level affects parasitoid communities and parasitism rates in two microlepidopteran species developing on hops (Humulus lupulus L.), Caloptilia fidella and Cosmopterix zieglerella, which employ leaf-rolling and leaf-mining strategies, respectively.

3. MethodsWe combined morphological identification with molecular species delimitation using ITS2 and CO1 markers and applied ASAP and bPTP methods to refine parasitoid taxonomy and detect cryptic species.

4. ResultsSemi-concealed C. fidella larvae in leaf rolls experienced significantly higher parasitism than their mining stages, whereas fully concealed C. zieglerella had lower parasitism rates. Molecular analyses confirmed the idiobiont strategy in Sympiesis acalle, S. sericeicornis, and Elachertus fenestratus, and bPTP proved more sensitive in detecting cryptic species than ASAP.

5. SignificanceThese findings demonstrate that semi-concealed hosts face a higher risk of parasitism than fully concealed hosts, suggesting that leaf-mining provides better protection than leaf-rolling in studied hosts. The study also highlights the power of molecular tools in species delimitation, emphasizing their importance for refining parasitoid taxonomy and advancing our understanding of host-parasitoid interactions."
"Neuropeptides exert broad effects across the brain to influence behavior. However, the mechanism by which the brain uses neuropeptide signaling to exert top-down control over complex behavioral responses remains poorly understood. Prolonged social isolation induces a distinct internal state that results in sweeping changes to behavior, including increased aggression. Here, we find that isolation-induced aggression activates Tachykinin-2 expressing (Tac2+) neurons in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Genetic characterization of Tac2+ cells in the mPFC reveals them to be a population of unexplored GABAergic neurons. In-depth behavioral analyses combined with in vivo recordings of neural activity demonstrate that mPFC Tac2+ neurons are tuned to distinct phases of isolation-induced aggression: investigatory behaviors that escalate to attack (aggression escalation) and attack itself (aggression release). Loss-of-function perturbations targeting the release of either Neurokinin B (NkB), the stimulatory peptide encoded by Tac2, or the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, reveal that these signaling molecules exert dissociable control over aggression escalation and release. These findings identify distinct roles for opposing signaling molecules co-released from the same population of cells. This suggests a surprising neurochemical mechanism by which neuropeptidergic populations in the prefrontal cortex exert top-down influence over complex behavior via the co-release of signaling molecules with opposing actions but coordinated impacts on behavior."

"Viruses face a selective pressure to evade cellular antiviral responses to control the outcome of an infection. However, due to their limited genome size, viruses must adopt unique strategies to confront cellular sensors. Since emerging in humans, SARS-CoV-2 has accrued multiple mutations throughout its genome, some of which enhanced virus replication and led to the rise of viral variants. However, the biological consequences of many of these changes remain to be discovered. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 produces a truncated form of the nucleocapsid protein, called N*M210. Due to the acquisition of a viral transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) in the N gene, certain variants, such as Omicron, produce a new viral mRNA that markedly increases N*M210 expression. We show that N*M210 is a dsRNA binding protein, which inhibits multiple arms of the cellular antiviral response, including blocking interferon induction and inhibiting stress granule formation. We created a panel of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 viruses (rSARS-2) with mutations in the N gene that increased or decreased N*M210 production. We show that N*M210 production increases virus fitness, as viruses that produce more N*M210 outcompeted wild-type rSARS-2. We demonstrate that the fitness advantage provided by N*M210 is partly due to its ability to potently block stress granules. We propose a model where, to evade the cellular antiviral response, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a mechanism to increase the production of a truncated form of the N protein, which broadly limits the activation of dsRNA-induced antiviral responses, tipping the balance in favour of the virus in the battle for control of the cell.

"Defective insulin secretion is a hallmark of diabetes mellitus. Glucose-induced Ca2+ oscillations are critical for the stimulation of insulin secretion, though the mechanisms through which these propagate across the islet are poorly understood. Here, we use beta cell-targeted GCaMP6f to explore the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ mobilization in response to submaximal (11mM) and hyperglycemic (25mM) glucose concentrations. Inhibition of inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) receptors, and other ion channels, with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) had minimal effects on the initial peak or intercellular connectivity provoked by 11mM glucose. However, 2-APB lowered subsequent glucose-induced cytosolic Ca2+ increases and connectivity at both 11 and 25mM glucose. Unexpectedly, the activation of IP3 receptors with the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist carbachol had minimal impact on the initial peak elicited by 11 mM glucose, but Ca2+ waves at 11 and 25 mM glucose were more poorly coordinated. To determine whether ER calcium mobilization was sufficient to initiate Ca2+ waves we next blocked sarco(endo)plasmic Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pumps with thapsigargin, whilst preventing plasma membrane depolarization with the KATP-channel opener, diazoxide. Under these conditions, an initial cytosolic Ca2+ increase was followed by secondary Ca2+ waves that slowly subsided. The application of carbachol alongside diazoxide still enhanced Ca2+ dynamics, though this activity was uncoordinated and beta cells were poorly connected. Our results show that ER Ca2+ mobilization plays a relatively minor role in the initiation and propagation of Ca2+ waves in response to glucose. On the other hand, ER stores are required to transition to sustained Ca2+ waves.

"The dynamics of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial populations are informed by the fitness impact of genetic determinants of resistance and antibiotic pressure. However, estimates of real-world fitness impact have been lacking. To address this gap, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian phylodynamic model to quantify contributions of resistance determinants to strain success in a 20-year collection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates. Fitness contributions varied with antibiotic use, and genetic pathways to phenotypically identical resistance conferred distinct fitness effects. These findings were supported by in vitro and experimental infection competition. Quantifying these fitness contributions to lineage dynamics reveals opportunities for investigation into other genetic and environmental drivers of fitness. This work thus establishes a method for linking pathogen genomics and antibiotic use to define factors shaping ecological trends."
"High-quality malt is influenced by three primary factors: barley genotype, environmental conditions, and malting process. To effectively evaluate malting barley breeding material and assess how environmental changes influence malt quality, it is essential to have laboratory-scale malting methods that can produce malt approximating that produced by commercial malting operations. However, existing laboratory-scale malting procedures often demand large quantities of grain, rely on specialized equipment, and are costly. To overcome these challenges, we developed a small sample-scale benchtop malting method utilizing standard laboratory equipment and components available at hardware stores. We validated the method by conducting standard malt quality tests including diastatic power, -amylase activity, total malt protein, and wort composition (soluble protein, wort soluble/total malt protein, {beta}-glucan, free amino nitrogen, and malt extract). Our findings indicate that the benchtop malting method yields quality metrics comparable to those obtained from established small-scale and full-scale malting protocols. Furthermore, a key innovation of this system is the use of separate Erlenmeyer flasks for malting each sample. Unlike conventional shared malting systems, this design enables precise measurement and comparison of treatment effects across samples malted simultaneously. This reliable, low-cost, and efficient method provides a valuable tool for screening malt quality traits in breeding lines with limited sample sizes and for testing malting regimes aimed at improving malt quality and efficiency. Additionally, it offers an accessible solution for producing high-quality, research-scale malt in laboratories without dedicated quality assurance facilities."
"In evolutionary time, aquatic crustaceans colonized land and faced new terrestrial predators such as spiders and ants. Working with the crustacean woodlouse Porcellio scaber, we tested the hypothesis that the shift from aquatic to terrestrial habitat prompted the evolution of defensive metabolites against terrestrial predators. When attacked by a predator, P. scaber woodlice expel proteinaceous secretions from their tegumental glands. Analyses of gland secretion extracts by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and by liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed four metabolites: methyl 8-hydroxy-quinoline-2-carboxylate, methyl 8-hydroxy-4-methoxy-quinoline-2-carboxylate, methyl 8-(sulfooxy)quinoline-2-carboxylate, and methyl 4-methoxy-8-(sulfooxy)quinoline-2-carboxylate, the latter three being natural products not previously known. In behavioural experiments, Steatoda grossa spiders preyed on chemically undefended Tenebrio molitor beetles but avoided chemically defended P. scaber. When beetles were rendered chemically defended by topical applications of either P. scaber gland secretion extract or synthetic metabolites identified in these extracts, spiders rejected the beetles as prey. Our data support the hypothesis that the evolutionary transition of crustaceans from aquatic to terrestrial habitats prompted the evolution of defensive metabolites against terrestrial predators. We show that crustaceans, like many insects, are chemically defended against predators.

"Design of new proteins is often formulated as an optimization task. An amino acid sequence is characterized by an energy, and this energy is sampled and minimized. Here, we use a parallel tempering algorithm to accelerate this task. A series of 100- or 200-residue proteins was designed using a modified Evolutionary Scale Modeling design module to maximize the confidence in structure prediction and globularity and minimize the surface hydrophobic residues. We show that parallel tempering is a viable alternative to Monte Carlo sampling and simulated annealing or related energy-based protein design methods, especially in the situation where a continuous flow of designed sequences is desired."
"Lead (Pb2+) toxicity poses a serious threat to human health and remains a global concern; therefore, there is a critical need for the development of easy-to-use and cost-effective tools for the rapid monitoring of Pb2+. In this study, we demonstrate the potential of the RNA Mango aptamer as a sensitive and selective sensor for Pb2+. Our findings reveal that trace amounts of Pb2+ induce the formation of the G-quadruplex motif in RNA Mango, which facilitates dye binding and activates fluorescence. A detailed investigation of the fluorescence properties of RNA Mango with three different dyes, TO1-Biotin, TO3-Biotin, and Thioflavin-T, in the presence of Pb2+ shows that RNA Mango has the highest binding affinity for Pb2+ in combination with TO1-Biotin, with a KD value as low as [~]100 nM. In the presence of Pb2+, RNA Mango has sub-micromolar affinity for all three dyes, showing the tightest binding to TO1-Biotin (KD [~]40 nM). Mango lead sensors detect low nanomolar concentrations of Pb2+ with limits of detection of 2 - 16 nM, which are significantly lower than its allowable limit in drinking water. RNA Mango exhibits remarkable selectivity toward Pb2+ and can detect lead in tap water samples. This work reports a new class of simple and inexpensive fluorescence-based sensors for lead and expands the repertoire of RNA-based lead sensors."
"ABSTRACTWe investigated the activity of the tuberculosis drug SQ109 against sixteen fungal pathogens: Candida albicans, C. auris, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondi, C. kefyr, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, Candida parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Rhizopus spp., Mucor spp., Fusarium spp., Coccidioides spp., Histoplasma capsulatum and Aspergillus fumigatus. MIC values varied widely (125 ng/mL to >64 {micro}g/mL) but in many cases we found promising (MIC[~]4 {micro}g/mL) activity as well as MFC/MIC ratios of [~]2. SQ109 metabolites were inactive. The activity of 12 analogs of SQ109 against Saccharomyces cerevisiae correlated with protonophore uncoupling activity, suggesting mitochondrial targeting, consistent with the observation that growth inhibition was rescued by agents which inhibit ROS species accumulation. SQ109 disrupted H+/Ca2+ homeostasis in S. cerevisiae vacuoles, and there was synergy (FICI[~]0.31) with pitavastatin, indicating involvement of isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway inhibition. SQ109 is, therefore, a potential antifungal agent with multi-target activity."
"Fate decisions of T helper (Th) cells are tightly linked to their metabolic states, but precise mechanistic links remain unknown, especially in humans. Using in vitro stimulation in combination with gene editing we studied how metabolic regulation shapes human Th1 cell identity and effector function. Differentiated Th1 cells displayed elevated STAT1 phosphorylation at Tyr701 and Ser727 as well as heightened T-bet and IFN{gamma} expression, which were dampened by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated STAT1 deletion. Metabolic profiling revealed enhanced glycolytic activity in Th1 in comparison to Act.T cells, evidenced by increased extracellular acidification rate, ATP production via glycolysis, glucose uptake, lactate secretion and NADH abundance. SCENITH analysis demonstrated elevated glycolysis-dependent anabolic activity of Th1 cells. Inhibition of glycolysis reduced IFN{gamma} production and STAT1 phosphorylation independent of JAK1/2 activity, STAT1 abundance or SHP-2 activity, implicating glycolysis directly in sustaining STAT1-mediated Th1 functionality. Mechanistically, O-Glycosylation, facilitated by O-Glycosyltransferase, emerged as pivotal in modulating STAT1 activity, as evident through immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Pharmaceutical O-Glycosyltransferase inhibition prevented Th1 differentiation as well as STAT1 O-glycosylation. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated mutation of the O-glycosylation sites Ser499 and Thr510 sites diminished STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation and IFN{gamma} synthesis. Together, this study highlights glycolysis as key regulator of human Th1 cell identity and effector function, with STAT1 O-Glycosylation selectively maintaining Th1 effector capacity. This mechanism could be explored to safeguard Th1 cells in antiviral immunity and autoimmunity.

"2.Asian hornbills are flagship species of the wet tropics that face significant threats from hunting, habitat loss, and fragmentation. Despite being conservation flagships, whole genome information is available for only two of the 32 Asian hornbill species. In this study, we provide the first de novo genome assemblies for four hornbill species (Bucerotidae) in Asia. We present hybrid genome assemblies for Buceros bicornis and Rhyticeros undulatus, and short-read genomes for Anthracoceros coronatus, and Aceros nipalensis. The genome sizes of these hornbills range from 1.1 Gb to 1.3 Gb with over 93% completeness and gene prediction BUSCO. We also provide annotated mitogenomes for each of these species. Furthermore, we estimated Pleistocene population trajectories for these four species, which vary in their habitat preferences. Our results indicate that Pleistocene climatic fluctuations have led to dramatic population declines in all four species. We believe that this study provides robust genomic resources to support future conservation genomics efforts for hornbills."
"Learning and memory in the brain depend on changes in the strengths of synaptic connections between neurons. While the molecular and cellular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been extensively studied experimentally, much of our understanding of how plasticity is organized across populations of neurons during task learning comes from training artificial neural networks (ANNs) using computational methods. However, the architectures of modern ANNs and the algorithms used to train them are not compatible with fundamental principles of neuroscience, leaving a gap in understanding how the brain coordinates learning across multiple layers of neural circuitry. Here we leverage recent experimental evidence to test an emergent theory that biological learning depends on specialization of distinct neuronal cell types and compartmentalized signaling within neuronal dendrites. We demonstrate that multilayer ANNs comprised of separate recurrently connected excitatory and inhibitory cell types, and neuronal units with separate soma and dendrite compartments, can be trained to accurately classify images using a fully biology-compatible deep learning algorithm called dendritic target propagation. By adhering to strict biological constraints, this model is able to provide unique insight into the biological mechanisms of learning and to make experimentally testable predictions regarding the roles of specific neuronal cell types in coordinating learning across different brain regions."
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer globally, accounting for 9.6% of all cancer cases and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. One of the common treatments for the disease is radiotherapy, which can come with dangerous side effects and varying outcomes in patients. Such factors highlight the need for personalized treatments, that depend on identifying biomarkers capable of effectively predicting patient responses to radiotherapy. Here, we integrated four data types including RNA, copy number alteration (CNA), mutational profiles and methylation profiles using a multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA), towards identifying predictive markers associated with therapeutic response. We identified a panel of 101 biomarkers associated with patients responses to radiotherapy that were further validated using a random forest classifier on an independent testing cohort. Our panel demonstrated effectiveness in predicting treatment outcomes, with an 89% accuracy to differentiate patients with complete response to radiotherapy compared to non-complete responders. We have demonstrated that this panel is predominantly expressed in CRC epithelial cells. This study presents a combined unsupervised and supervised approach to underscore multiple patterns of variation associated with treatment outcomes, and presents a predictive panel of marker genes associated with radiotherapy treatment response in CRC."
"Gentrification is occurring across urban areas in the United States and poses threats to marginalized and vulnerable communities through displacement, disruption of social networks, and worsening health outcomes. Gentrification is both a social and environmental process, affecting socioecological factors responsible for driving mosquito abundance and community composition. Our study aims to investigate how gentrification in Miami-Dade County, Florida, affects the alpha and beta diversity of mosquito communities. We relied on data from the Miami-Dade County Mosquito Control Division from 2020 to 2024, paired with data from the American Community Survey, to analyze changes in mosquito community composition based on gentrification status. Our results show that gentrification, measured by changes in home value, age, race, and education, significantly affected mosquito richness and community composition at county and neighborhood levels. Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti, primary arbovirus vector species, were more abundant in gentrifying areas, representing 31% of community composition variation compared to non-gentrifying areas. These findings have important implications for improving mosquito-borne disease preparedness and response in urban settings."
"Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis faces challenges regarding sensitivity and quantification accuracy, particularly in areas with low target species densities or during seasons when eDNA release decreases. Multi-copy markers such as mitochondrial genomic DNA and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) have been widely used in eDNA analysis to address this issue. However, the copy number of the DNA markers per cell remains a potential bottleneck for eDNA sensitivity. In this study, we aimed to increase the sensitivity of eDNA assays by using retrotransposons, which are abundant in the genome, as novel target markers. We developed an assay targeting UnaSINE1, a short interspersed nucleotide element (SINE) characteristic of Anguilla eels, and compared its sensitivity and accuracy with that of an established mitochondrial 16S rRNA marker. Our results demonstrated that UnaSINE1 was detected at over 100 times the copy number of the mitochondrial marker in both genomic and eDNA samples. In the river surveys, the 16S marker was positive in 32 of the 81 samples, whereas the UnaSINE1 marker was positive in 62 samples, indicating that the use of SINE marker remarkably reduced false negatives. Furthermore, both biological and technical replicates exhibited improved positive consistency and reduced variability in quantification, leading to more robust presence/absence determination and quantitative results. Utilizing retrotransposon sequences as markers requires additional effort for sequence acquisition and organization and may limit taxonomic resolution to the genus level. However, this approach significantly improves sensitivity without increasing the labor or cost of sampling and PCR analysis, making it highly practical for eDNA studies."
"Natural scenes usually contain many objects that need to be segregated from each other and the background. Object-based attention is the process that groups image fragments belonging to the same objects. Curve-tracing tasks provide a special case, testing our ability to group image elements of an elongated curve. In the brain, curve-tracing is associated with the gradual spread of enhanced neuronal activity over the representation of the traced curve. Previous studies demonstrated that the tracing speed is higher if curves are far apart than if they are nearby. One hypothesis is that a larger distance between curves permits activity propagation in higher visual cortex areas. In these higher areas receptive fields are larger and connections exist between neurons representing image regions that are farther apart (Pooresmaeili et al., 2014). We propose a recurrent architecture for the scale-invariant tracing of curves and objects. The architecture is composed of a feedforward pathway that dynamically selects the appropriate scale for tracing, and a recurrent pathway for propagating enhanced neuronal activity through horizontal and feedback connections, enabled by a disinhibitory loop involving VIP and SOM interneurons. We trained the network using a biologically plausible reinforcement learning scheme and observed that training on short curves allowed the networks to generalize to longer curves and 2D-objects. The network chose the scale based on the distance between curves and the width of objects, just as in human psychophysics and the visual cortex of monkeys. The results provide a mechanistic account of the learning and execution of multiscale perceptual grouping in the brain."
"Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are the most prevalent ventricular arrhythmia in adults. High PVC burden can lead to left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, eccentric hypertrophy, and an increased risk of heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Inadequate angiogenesis is a key determinant in the transition from adaptive to maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis is a risk factor for arrhythmia and SCD. To quantitatively assess structural remodeling and transcriptional alterations in PVC-induced cardiomyopathy (PVC-CM), animals were implanted with modified pacemakers to deliver bigeminal PVCs (200-220 ms coupling interval) for 12 weeks. Collagen deposition and interstitial ultrastructure of LV samples were analyzed using light and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Pericytes, fibroblasts, myocytes, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells were imaged using confocal microscopy, quantified with an artificial intelligence-based segmentation analysis, and compared using hierarchical statistics. Transcriptional changes were assessed via RNAseq. Although cardiomyocytes hypertrophied in PVC-CM, capillary rarefaction was overcome by an increase in capillary- to-myocyte ratio. Additionally, thicker blood vessels were more abundant in PVC-CM. Fibroblast-to-myocyte ratio more than doubled, interstitial collagen fibers increased, and interstitial space thickened in PVC-CM. Transcripts involved in interstitial remodeling, inflammatory response, and alarmins were strongly elevated in PVC-CM. Overall, while the angiogenic response meets the metabolic demands of cardiac hypertrophy, upregulated markers of inflammation and cardiomyopathy linked to reactive fibrosis collectively represent an adverse LV remodeling that heightens the risk of HF and SCD in PVC-CM."
"Astrocytes, a main type of glia cells in the cortex, provide metabolic support to neurons, and their possible function as a synaptic partner has given rise to the notion of ""tripartite"" synapses, suggesting a contribution to neuronal computations. For astrocytes to serve such purposes, the interactions with synapses in neuronal circuits require a level of specificity beyond overall synaptic support. A systematic mapping of the astrocyte-connectome relationship would enable the testing of these hypotheses - such analysis is however still lacking, in particular for circuits in the cerebral cortex. Here, utilizing previously published connectomic data of more than 200,000 synapses, we systematically analyzed the spatial relation between astrocytes and synapses in mouse somatosensory cortex. We developed a quantitative assessment of astrocyte-synapse proximity, finding that only 22.7% of synapses are contacted by astrocytic processes for more than 50% of their synaptic circumference. This non-ubiquitous astrocytic attachment would render astrocyte-synapse specificity plausible. Astrocytic coverage depended strongly on synapse types, with thalamocortical shaft synapses being the most covered by astrocytic processes. We furthermore observed a strong dependence of astrocytic synaptic coverage on synapse size, which was exclusive for excitatory spine synapses. We then investigated the possible relation of astrocytic synaptic coverage to neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity, finding ultrastructural evidence for substantially reduced astrocytic support at synapses consistent with long-term depression, but not for astrocytic coverage dependence on baseline neuronal presynaptic activity. Together, our data demonstrate a high level of specificity of astrocyte-synapse interactions for particular synaptic types. They indicate the potential relevance of astrocytic coverage for synapse stability, in particular for large synapses, suggesting a contribution to long-term maintenance of learned synaptic states. These methods will allow a systematic testing of hypotheses about glial-neuronal interaction in various brain regions, disease models and species including human."
"The nutritional profiles of dried yellow mealworms and housefly maggots were analyzed and compared with conventional protein sources in poultry diets such as fish meal (FM) and soybean meal (SBM). Nutrient composition was determined through proximate analysis, while amino acid and mineral contents were analyzed using HPLC-based amino acid analyzer and atomic absorption spectrophotometer, respectively. Metabolizable energy (ME) was calculated to estimate energy content per kilogram of feed. The crude protein content of housefly maggots (57.8%) was comparable to that of fish meal (58.5%), which was the highest among the evaluated feeds, while mealworms had a slightly lower protein content (51.02%). The highest ether extract values were recorded for mealworms (27.3%) and maggots (26.9%), surpassing those in FM and SBM. The highest ME was calculated for housefly maggots (4,074 kcal/kg), followed by mealworms (3,988 kcal/kg) and FM (3,824 kcal/kg). Mineral profiling showed the highest calcium content in mealworms (5.23 g/kg), followed by maggots (5.13 g/kg). Phosphorus and zinc were recorded highest in housefly maggots, at 16.8 g/kg and 98.5 mg/kg, respectively. The limiting amino acids lysine, leucine, and isoleucine were highest in housefly maggots, followed by FM and mealworms, showing comparable values between the insect meals and FM. Methionine content was recorded highest in mealworms (2.3 g/100g), closely followed by housefly maggots (2.27 g/100g). The study demonstrated that housefly maggots and mealworms have a nutritive profile superior to soybean meal and comparable to fish meal."
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematological malignancies. However, its application in solid tumors remains limited because single targets are unlikely to suffice due to tumor antigen heterogeneity and off-tumor toxicities. To overcome these obstacles, we developed LogiCAR designer, a computational approach that utilizes single-cell transcriptomics data from patient tumors to systematically identify the cancer-specific antigen circuits with logic gates (""AND,"" ""OR,"" and ""NOT"") that target the majority of cancer cells in a tumor while sparing normal cells and tissues as much as possible. LogiCAR designer efficiently scales to higher-order antigen combinations involving up to five genes. Applied to a large-scale dataset encompassing approximately 2 million cells (including > 620k tumor cells) from 342 clinical patient samples across all major breast cancer subtypes, LogiCAR designer identified antigen circuits with enhanced tumor-targeting efficacy and improved safety profiles compared to both previously reported circuits and single-target therapies in clinical trials. However, even these optimized shared circuits still proved insufficient for some patients. We hence systematically studied LogiCAR designers ability to identify highly effective CAR circuits that are individualized to each patient. Remarkably, such personalized CAR circuits provide estimated tumor-targeting efficacy tantamount to complete response in 76% of patients and partial response for all patients. Taken together, this analysis is the first systematic quantification of the efficacy and safety of all possible CAR circuits, showing that: (a) the quality of existing solutions leaves much to be desired; (b) the ability of shared circuits optimized across many patients is moderate, and finally, (c) individually tailored circuits offer significantly higher tumor-targeting efficacies for patients. LogiCAR designer offers a rigorous, data-driven way to facilitate the rational design of safe and effective CAR-based immunotherapies for cancer.

Statement of Significance Development of a computational approach that efficiently identifies logic-gated CAR target combinations, called circuits, from single-cell transcriptomics, addressing a critical unmet clinical need.
 Application to the largest ensemble of breast cancer datasets to date, comprising [~]2 million cells (> 620k tumor cells) from 17 clinical cohorts, to identify CAR circuits predicted to be effective.
 Comprehensive safety profiling of candidate circuits spanning major tissues at both RNA and protein levels.
 Logic-gated CAR circuits generated by our pipeline address tumor heterogeneity and achieve efficacy and safety scores that surpass clinical trial and previously computationally identified circuits.
 Individualized rational CAR design offers a transformative approach to deliver precision-engineered CAR therapies with unprecedented efficacy."
"Metastasis remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, yet predicting future metastasis is a major clinical challenge due to the lack of validated biomarkers and effective assessment methods. Here, we present EmitGCL, a deep-learning framework that accurately predicts future metastasis and its corresponding biomarkers. Based on a comprehensive benchmarking comparison, EmitGCL outperformed other computational tools across six cancer types from seven cohorts of patients with superior sensitivity and specificity. It captured occult metastatic cells in a patient with a lymph node-negative breast cancer, who was declared to have no evidence of disease by conventional imaging methods but was later confirmed to have a metastatic disease. Notably, EmitGCL identified HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1 as predictable biomarkers for future breast cancer metastasis, which was validated across five independent cohorts of patients (n=420). Furthermore, we demonstrated YY1 transcription factor as a key driver of breast cancer metastasis which was validated through in-silico and CRISPR-based migration assays, suggesting that YY1 is a potential therapeutic target for deterring metastasis."
"Deoxyribonucleic Acids (DNA) have been used for a few decades to form nanostructures with precisely tunable features, shapes, responses, etc. Some of the most basic structures, DNA nanostars (DNAns) have been used to form soft matter hydrogels with unique functionalizations and responses to soluble stimuli as well as physical cues. Notably these studies use  arms comprising a single duplex whereas more complex nanostructures, DNA origami, can have a multitude of duplexes bundled together to produce different structural properties. Herein I introduce DNAns bundling two duplexes together, commonly known as double crossover (DX) motifs to enable multi scale mechanical design of hydrogels with interchangeable strands, i.e. modular DX-DNAns hydrogels. This is achieved by rational design of the internal structure to facilitate the propagation of forces through and across the different motifs driving unique organizational aspects which produce specific viscoelastic features evidenced by bulk-scale rheological profiles. This work begins to bridge the near endless complexities available with DNA origami based nanostructures to the more application based potentials for large-scale functional nanostructured materials. Particularly I highlight the versatility of this method by implementing a DNA based pH response motif, i-motif, which has this far only enabled switchable mechanical properties from the gel-to-sol states but herein there is graded change in mechanistic properties while sustaining the gel state, something that has only been achieved via strand displacement in DNAns hydrogels thus far. Demonstrating the breadth of new possibilities for DNA hydrogels with the added functionality of bundled duplexes used in DNA Origami effectively ushering in a  new era for the field."
"Classifying subtypes of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) from connected speech presents significant diagnostic challenges due to overlapping linguistic markers. This study benchmarks the performance of traditional machine learning models with various feature extraction techniques, transformer-based models, and large language models (LLMs) for PPA classification. Our results indicate that while transformerbased models and LLMs exceed chance-level performance in terms of balanced accuracy, traditional classifiers combined with contextual embeddings remain highly competitive. Notably, SVM using RoBERTas embeddings achieves the highest classification accuracy. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning in enhancing the automatic classification of PPA subtypes."
"IntroductionThe complex dynamics of cytoskeletal meshworks make them a difficult subject of study. With the advent of fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) and other technological advances in microscopy techniques, much more is now known about how the filamentous actin (F-actin) and microtubule (MT) networks work within cells to give rise to the vast array of functions which require them. A current challenge to the imaging field is to improve the utility and accuracy of the computational approaches required to analyze large and complex imaging datasets. Here, we present the results of a computational method that, when applied to FSM time-lapse series, can capture the instantaneous state of the rapidly changing, dense, and multi-directional speckle flows often exhibited by cytoskeletal dynamics in living systems. Re-analysis of previously published FSM image sets demonstrates that this method, which we call the Instantaneous Flow Tracking Algorithm (IFTA), can accurately detect speckle flows in mitotic spindles and F-actin meshworks, even in regions of high dynamicity of overlapping, anti-parallel flows where previous methods failed.

MethodsThe anti-parallel flow at the metaphase plate of the mitotic spindle is a well-known phenomenon during the initial stages of chromosome segregation and it has been measured by several approaches, mostly in stationary spindles which do not exhibit any polar rotation. The mitotic spindle is the target of many cancer and neurodegenerative drugs and as such, there has been many attempts at inhibiting its basic functions with the objective of preventing chromosome segregation and the formation of new daughter cells. Such attempts have largely been focused on the inhibition of the action of MT plus-end directed motors, for instance the kinesin KIF11. Spindles with inhibited kinesins have been thought to exhibit no MT flux, however IFTA measured regional flux of up to 2.7 {micro}m/min, which reveals the activity of potent secondary flux mechanisms. These results suggest novel, additional, approaches toward arresting cells in mitosis during patient treatment.

ResultsThe traditional tracking methods erroneously measure zero flux in areas where contractile F-actin flows meet, denoted as a ""convergence zone"" and commonly found in the lamella of motile cells and the neck of growth cones. When IFTA was used to analyze FSM datasets derived from these structures, we detected high rates of protein turnover, anti-parallel speckle motion, and fast flux of actin subunits in both directions in the same ""convergence zones"". This demonstrates the presence of a molecular machinery based on contractility in the lamella/lamellipodium of migrating cells and at the base of growing neurons, which can be exploited in the clinic. When applied to FSM data of migrating kangaroo rat kidney epithelial PtK1 cells overexpressing different isoforms of the actin-based motor tropomyosin, IFTA revealed distinct, isoform-specific effects on contractile F-actin flows. Specifically, we found that decreased affinity between tropomyosin and F-actin correlated with an increase in speckle velocity heterogeneity.

ConclusionsSuch quantitative imaging analysis offers the ability to reliably test novel therapeutics ex vivo.

Significance statementThe main discoveries presented in the manuscript are related to the ability of the cell to adapt to a range of biochemical and mechanical perturbations. As cell therapy is becoming the forefront of precision medicine, it would be critical to anticipate the mechanisms of action of engineered immune cells. The pathways activated during therapy can be pinpointed by measuring its effects on the target proteins in patient-derived living cells. The clinical application of the approach outlined in this manuscript pertains to analyzing drug resistance in cancer therapy and the treatment of neurodegeneration. Our hypothesis is that targeting actin in resistant tumors could sensitize cancer cells to tubulin inhibitors. If this proves true, it will have implications in the clinic."
"Alexithymia is a multidimensional construct characterized by difficulties in identifying and describing feelings and reduced ability to engage in abstract thinking. Although often co-occurring with other psychological and neurodevelopmental conditions such as anxiety, depression and autism spectrum disorders, alexithymia is believed to be associated with unique alterations within the socio-emotional brain networks. With the semantic and neuromodulatory brainstem systems playing a key role in social and affective cognition, the current work aimed to study their contributions to alexithymia in unprecedented detail. First, we attempted to identify resting-state functional connectivity patterns of the social semantic hubs (superior anterior temporal lobe) and monoamine-producing regions (dorsal raphe, ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus) linked to each alexithymia domain. Secondly, by deploying tractography and graph analysis of the associated structural network, we intended to identify their potential anatomical correlates. Alexithymia was strongly associated with dysconnectivity within the semantic network, and altered functional connectivity between the neuromodulatory brainstem regions and cortical areas crucial for social cognition and emotion regulation, including medial prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule. On the anatomical level, these findings were paralleled by negative links with network modularity, suggestive of less specialised neural processing, and decreased clustering coefficient of the semantic node in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus. Despite observing associations with trait-anxiety and emotion suppression for some of the highlighted findings, these phenomena did not mediate the effects of alexithymia. Therefore, the current work highlights the existence of functional and structural alterations within socio-emotional networks as neural markers of alexithymia."
"1. ContextAccurate three-dimensional (3D) models of skeletal and other biological specimens are crucial for ecological and evolutionary research and teaching. Here, we present a streamlined, open-source workflow for 3D photogrammetry that allows researchers to construct 3D models using the 3D Slicer and the SlicerMorph ecosystem.

2. Objectives and MethodsWe present an updated photogrammetry pipeline within the 3D Slicer ecosystem that combines advanced image masking via Segment Anything Model (SAM) with the open-source ODM reconstruction engine. Our approach systematically reduces artifacts in delicate cranial regions by automating background removal. We validate this pipeline against micro-CT references using multiple rodent skull specimens, quantifying accuracy through mean distance, root mean square error (RMSE), Hausdorff distance, and Chamfer distance.

3. ResultsOur method consistently reduces average surface error by 10-15% compared to a previous open-source photogrammetry workflow. This gain is particularly pronounced around thin or fenestrated anatomical structures such as zygomatic arches, where the previous workflow created the most noise. Although occasional increases in Hausdorff distance reflect localized photography gaps, improved mean distance and RMSE underscore improved overall fidelity.

4. Main ConclusionsThe 3D Slicer Photogrammetry extension provides a robust, fully open-source solution for generating high-quality 3D reconstructions from photographs. The streamlined pipeline lowers technical barriers to collecting reliable 3D data and fosters reproducible research across diverse biological collections."
"Implantable biohybrid systems with computer-controlled actuation offer the capacity to modulate biological forces, but require biocompatible, self-sustaining, and scalable actuators. Repurposing biological muscles can fulfill this need. However, muscle fatigue limits the fundamental capabilities of muscle-actuated systems. Here we present a fatigue-resistant myoneural actuator (MNA) with engineered recruitment biophysics in a rodent model. The MNA is based on manipulating native axonal composition through sensory reinnervation. This regenerative approach redirects volitional control to computer control via nerve stimulation while maintaining self-sustainability. Compared to native muscles without the myoneural manipulation, fatigue resistance is augmented by 260%. Furthermore, we demonstrate closed-loop control with reversible neural isolation of the actuator, preventing unintended neural signaling to the central nervous system during operation. To illustrate the potential of the MNA technology, we present a biohybrid neuroprosthetic interface and a biohybrid organ system capable of modulating neural afferents and organ mechanics, respectively. Our framework demonstrates augmented biological muscle actuation while maintaining inherent tissue properties, bridging the technological gap for implantable biohybrid systems."
"In the absence of infection, blood has previously been understood to be free of microbes. However, with advances in sequencing technology this notion has been challenged, prompting new investigations into microbial DNA within the blood of both healthy and diseased individuals. To comprehensively survey microbial DNA in blood, we separated blood into fractions (plasma, red blood cells, and buffy coat) and assessed if the microbial-DNA is cell-free by the addition of DNase to a subset of each fraction. We measured 16S rRNA gene copy number with digital droplet PCR and identified the taxonomic origin of the microbial DNA with synthetic full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. As a use case, we examine microbial DNA from the blood of 5 men without prostate cancer (PC), 5 men with low-grade PC, and 5 men with high-grade PC. Our study demonstrates that the majority of microbial DNA is cell-free, indicating that it is not representative of proliferating microbes. Our analyses also revealed buffy coat had the lowest number of 16S rRNA gene copies yet highest number of genera of the fractions (median 23.3 copies/{micro}L and 10 genera) and thus may be a useful fraction to study moving forward. Additionally, microbial DNA in blood may have utility as a biomarker, as we detected disease-associated compositional differences in the plasma and buffy coat fractions. This study lays the groundwork for rigorously studying microbial DNA in blood, however larger studies are needed to confirm our disease-association findings.

ImportanceThe concept of a ""blood microbiome"" has sparked debate in recent years, with questions about whether microbes truly exist in circulation. This study provides a crucial evaluation of the fractions of blood and their capacity to harbor microbial DNA, offering important context for prior and future research. By using DNase to differentiate between cell-associated and cell-free microbial DNA, we show that while microbial DNA is present in blood, it is sparse and heterogenous. These findings highlight the need for rigorous study design that carefully considers both positive and negative controls, as well as the specific blood fractions being examined."
"RNAs are major drivers of phase separation in the formation of biomolecular condensates, and can undergo protein-free phase separation in the presence of divalent ions or crowding agents. Much remains to be understood regarding how the complex interplay of base stacking, base pairing, electrostatics, ion interactions, and particularly structural propensities governs RNA phase behavior. Here we develop an intermediate resolution model for condensates of RNAs (iConRNA) that can capture key local and long-range structure features of dynamic RNAs and simulate their spontaneous phase transitions with Mg2+. Representing each nucleotide using 6-7 beads, iConRNA accurately captures base stacking and pairing and includes explicit Mg2+. The model does not only reproduce major conformational properties of poly(rA) and poly(rU), but also correctly folds small structured RNAs and predicts their melting temperatures. With an effective model of explicit Mg2+, iConRNA successfully recapitulates experimentally observed lower critical solution temperature phase separation of poly(rA) and triplet repeats, and critically, the nontrivial dependence of phase transitions on RNA sequence, length, concentration, and Mg2+ level. Further mechanistic analysis reveals a key role of RNA folding in modulating phase separation as well as its temperature and ion dependence, besides other driving forces such as Mg2+-phosphate interactions, base stacking, and base pairing. These studies also support iConRNA as a powerful tool for direct simulation of RNA-driven phase transitions, enabling molecular studies of how RNA conformational dynamics and its response to complex condensate environment control the phase behavior and condensate material properties.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDynamic RNAs and proteins are major drivers of biomolecular phase separation that has been recently discovered to underlie numerous biological processes and be involved in many human diseases. Molecular simulation has an indispensable role to play in dissecting the driving forces and regulation of biomolecular phase separation. The current work describes a high-resolution coarse-grained RNA model that is capable of describing the structure dynamics and complex sequence, concentration, temperature and ion dependent phase transitions of flexible RNAs. The study further reveals a central role of RNA folding in coordinating Mg2+-phosphate interactions, base stacking, and base pairing to drive phase separation, paving the road for studies of RNA-mediated phase separation in relevant biological contexts."
"For people with HIV (PWH), substance use disorders (SUDs) are a prominent neurological risk factor, and the impacts of both on dopaminergic pathways are a potential point of deleterious convergence. Here, we profile, at single nucleus resolution, the substantia nigra (SN) transcriptomes of 90 postmortem donors in the context of chronic HIV and opioid/cocaine SUD, including 67 prospectively characterized PWH. We report altered microglial expression for hundreds of pro- and anti-inflammatory regulators attributable to HIV, and separately, to SUD. Stepwise, progressive microglial dysregulation, coupled to altered SN dopaminergic and GABAergic signaling, was associated with SUD/HIV dual diagnosis and further with lack of viral suppression in blood. In virologically suppressed donors, SUD comorbidity was associated with microglial transcriptional changes permissive for HIV infection. We report HIV-related downregulation of monoamine reuptake transporters specifically in dopaminergic neurons regardless of SUD status or viral load, and additional transcriptional signatures consistent with selective vulnerability of SN dopamine neurons."
"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Despite extensive research, its precise etiology remains unclear, posing significant challenges to understanding and treatment. The disease pathogenesis involves self-reactive T cells and immune-related cytokines. Genome-wide association studies have identified various susceptibility loci for immune-related diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain only partially understood. Recent discoveries of critical signaling pathways, biological processes, and immune cell involvement have expanded our knowledge and offer hope for improved therapeutic strategies.

This study aimed to enhance our understanding of psoriasis and proposes novel therapeutic approaches by employing integrated bioinformatics to identify signaling pathways and biological processes as potential disease markers.

Presenting a systematic review and taking a meta-analytical approach to transcriptomic profiles, this investigation examined differential gene expression patterns across 44 studies involving 975 samples comparing lesional psoriasis, non-lesional psoriasis, and healthy controls. Consensus transcriptome signatures revealed a significant association between immune-related genes and psoriasis pathogenesis. Functional enrichment analysis identified several enriched pathways related to immunity and immune system processes. Comparison of these findings with the existing literature indicated that some immune-related genes were already known, while others are novel in the context of psoriasis. Additionally, novel gene analysis demonstrated psoriasis involvement in pathways such as gluconeogenesis, the FoxO signaling pathway, and mitophagy.

This integrative approach confirmed classic genetic associations while uncovering novel gene expression patterns and pathways relevant to psoriasis. Notably, the disruption of the gluconeogenesis pathway emerged as a critical finding. These insights enhance our understanding of psoriasis pathophysiology and pave the way for targeted therapies, offering improved management options for affected individuals."
"Liquid brains conceptualize living systems operating without central control, where collective outcomes emerge from local but dynamic interactions. Therefore, movement is expected to shape the connectivity among individuals, allowing the system to optimize its efficiency. We empirically measured ant movement behavior across large spatiotemporal scales, closely reflecting the ecology of our model species, Aphaenogaster senilis. We then incorporated this into a liquid brain framework, enabling a quantitative replication of ant foraging efficiency and their spatiotemporal dynamics. Our results highlight that a simple feedback mechanism explains the foraging patterns of this species. Indeed, such feedback is modulated by adjusting the proportion of two coexisting movement behaviors: while the recruits facilitated information transfer and food exploitation by aggregating closely to the nest, the scouts mostly bypassed this feedback, enabling the discovery of alternative food sources. These findings underscore how complex systems frameworks can benefit from empirical insights, enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying collective intelligence in biological systems."
"Cancer-driven cachexia is a deleterious syndrome which involves progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass with or without fat loss, fatigue, and weakness that cannot be reversed by nutritional intake. Recent studies have shown deregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways in skeletal muscles in various catabolic conditions, including cancer growth. However, the role of individual arms of the UPR in regulation of muscle mass remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the IRE1/XBP1 arm of the UPR stimulates the activation of ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy, JAK-STAT3 signaling, and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle of the KPC mouse model of pancreatic cancer cachexia. Furthermore, our results show that IRE1/XBP1 pathway is a key contributor to cachexia as targeted ablation of XBP1 transcription factor in mouse skeletal muscle inhibits KPC tumor-induced muscle wasting. Transcriptionally active XBP1 protein binds to the promoter region of multiple genes whose products are involved in skeletal muscle wasting. Treatment of KPC tumor-bearing mice with 4{micro}8C, a small molecule IRE1 inhibitor, reverses cachexia-induced molecular changes and improves skeletal muscle mass and strength. Altogether, our study highlights that the IRE1/XBP1 signaling axis mediates pancreatic cancer-induced muscle wasting and inhibition of this pathway could be a potential approach to mitigate muscle wasting in pancreatic cancer patients."
"O-GlcNAcase inhibitors (OGAi) have been proposed as therapeutics for Alzheimers disease due to their ability to increase O-GlcNAcylation of tau and reduce its aggregation. However, the recent failure of ceperognastat in a Phase II trial--marked by accelerated cognitive decline in the treatment arm--has raised concerns about the safety of this therapeutic class. Here, we evaluated the acute synaptic effects of three structurally distinct OGAi (ceperognastat, ASN90, and MK8719) in mouse hippocampal slices. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that all three compounds impaired both short- and long-term synaptic plasticity, as evidenced by reduced paired-pulse facilitation/depression and suppressed long-term potentiation.

Immunohistochemistry showed altered synaptic protein levels, with increased PSD-95 and reduced Synaptophysin 1 in neurons, alongside a biphasic shift in Tau phosphorylation. These findings indicate that OGAi produce rapid and convergent synaptotoxic effects across pre- and postsynaptic compartments, likely reflecting a class-wide mechanism. We argue that electrophysiological screening should be standard in CNS drug development and caution against targeting essential synaptic processes in chronic neurodegenerative conditions."
"Fermentative yeasts play important roles in both ecological and industrial processes but their distribution and abundance in natural environments is not well understood. We investigated the diversity of yeast species associated with oak trees (Quercus spp.) in the northern range limit of oak in Sweden, and identified climatic and ecological conditions governing their distribution. We isolated yeasts from oak bark collected from 28 forests and identified them to the species level using metabarcoding. Most communities were dominated by species in the Saccharomycetaceae family, especially by species of Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, and Pichia. Each of these genera showed a distinct latitudinal and longitudinal distribution, and both temperature and precipitation metrics predicted significant variation in their abundance. Consistent with this, laboratory assays revealed significant effects of temperature on the growth of strains collected from different longitudes and latitudes. We further found that older trees harbour more diverse and more balanced microbial communities with more evenly distributed species abundances, and that communities across trees were more similar when sharing a common dominant genus. This work provides a baseline for future studies on the impact of climate change on the microbial biodiversity of temperate forests in northern latitudes, and contributes to a growing collection of fermentative yeasts isolated from the wild with potential for biotechnological applications."
"For over thirty years, research has highlighted a sex bias in early research, risking the validity of biological knowledge. The first step towards change is effectively challenging misconceptions allowing researchers to perceive sex inclusive research as do-able. Utilising the theory of planned behaviour, we quantified researchers intention as a proxy measure for conducting sex inclusive research and explored attitude (value of the behaviour), subjective norm (perceived social pressure) and behavioural control (ability to conduct the behaviour). Additionally, we quantified the knowledge gap, prevalence of misconceptions, and assessed perceived benefits and barriers. We tested a workshop intervention that directly challenges the cultural embedded barriers. The data shows researchers intentions were high, but they had weak statistical knowledge and misunderstandings leading to a perception that inclusive research is prohibitive due to cost and animal use. We demonstrate that participation in the training intervention improved knowledge, altered the perceived barriers and cultural expectations."
"The mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), situated in the ventral hypothalamus, directs daily cellular and physiological rhythms across the body. The SCN clockwork is a self-sustaining transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL) that in turn co-ordinates the expression of clock-controlled genes (CCGs) directing circadian programmes of SCN cellular activity. In the mouse, the transcription factor, ZFHX3 (zinc finger homeobox-3), is necessary for the development of the SCN and influences circadian behaviour in the adult. The molecular mechanisms by which ZFHX3 affects the SCN at transcriptomic and genomic levels are, however, poorly defined. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to map the genomic localization of ZFHX3 binding sites in SCN chromatin. To test for function, we then conducted comprehensive RNA sequencing at six distinct times-of-day to compare the SCN transcriptional profiles of control and ZFHX3-conditional null mutants. We show that the genome-wide occupancy of ZFHX3 occurs predominantly around gene transcription start sites (TSS), co-localizing with known histone modifications, and preferentially partnering with clock transcription factors (CLOCK, BMAL1) to regulate clock gene(s) transcription. Correspondingly, we show that the conditional loss of ZFHX3 in the adult has a dramatic effect on the SCN transcriptome, including changes in the levels of transcripts encoding elements of numerous neuropeptide neurotransmitter systems while attenuating the daily oscillation of the clock TF Bmal1. Furthermore, various TTFL genes and CCGs exhibited altered circadian expression profiles, consistent with an advanced in daily behavioural rhythms under 12h light-12h dark conditions. Together, these findings reveal the extensive genome-wide regulation mediated by ZFHX3 in the central clock that orchestrates daily timekeeping in mammals."
"The DNA sensor cGAS and the signaling adaptor STING play a key role in the innate immune response to microbial and endogenous DNA in the cytoplasm. The cGAS-STING signaling pathway has evolved to promote immune defense and organismal fitness, yet its dysregulation can lead to chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, and neurodegeneration. Upon sensing double- stranded DNA, cGAS produces a cyclic dinucleotide second messenger that binds to STING in the endoplasmic reticulum. Ligand-bound STING translocates to the Golgi and activates the protein kinase TBK1 and the transcription factor IRF3, resulting in IRF3-driven interferon (IFN) gene transcription. This cascade of molecular events is mechanistically linked to intracellular lipid membrane dynamics and protein lipidation. To explore whether STING signaling is controlled by the availability and metabolic flux of cellular lipids, we screened small-molecule compounds targeting lipid metabolic pathways for their influence on STING agonist-responsive IFN induction. These screens identified inhibitors of the fatty acid synthase FAS and lipases as potent suppressors of STING signaling. An inhibitor of the cholesterol-esterifying enzyme SOAT1 enhanced STING-dependent IFN induction in mouse cells while attenuating it in human cells. Our findings reveal a connection between STING signaling and lipid metabolism and opportunities for expanding the toolbox for treating clinical conditions that arise from aberrant STING activity."
"Aging is associated with cognitive decline and memory impairment, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between mid-frontal theta (5 Hz) and occipital gamma (>30 Hz) oscillations is a proposed marker for parallel storage of multiple items in working memory. However, research has mainly focused on young individuals and epilepsy patients, with only a few studies on aging populations. Moreover, these studies have relied on univariate PAC methods, which can be flawed by potential spurious or biased PAC estimates due to non-stationarity of EEG signals. Additionally, these methods typically assess PAC at the level of individual electrodes, potentially overlooking the broader functional significance of theta-gamma coupling in coordinating neural activity across distant brain regions.

To address these gaps, we employed multivariate PAC (mPAC) through generalized eigendecomposition (GED) analysis, which avoids the pitfalls of non-sinusoidal oscillations. 113 young and 117 older healthy participants engaged in a sequence learning paradigm (6423 sequence repetitions, 55944 stimuli), in which they learned a fixed sequence of visual stimuli over repeated observations, allowing us to track the mPAC during the incremental process of learning.

Behavioral results revealed that younger participants learned significantly faster than older participants. Neurophysiological data showed that mPAC increased over the course of learning in both age groups and could identify fast and slow learners. However, older participants exhibited lower mPAC compared to younger counterparts, which suggest compromised parallel storage of items in working memory in older age. Finally, stratification analysis revealed that mPAC effects persist across performance groups with similar mid-frontal theta levels, suggesting that theta alone does not account for these effects. These findings shed light on the age-related differences in memory formation processes and may guide interventions to enhance memory performance in older adults and slow learners."
"Spatial transcriptomics technologies aim to spatially map gene expression in tissues and typically use oligonucleotide array surfaces that have undergone spatial indexing. These arrays are used to capture nucleic acids diffusing from adjacently placed tissues, allowing subsequent sequencing to reveal both gene and position. Slide-tags is a recently developed method by Russell et al. that inverts this principle. Instead of capturing molecules released from the tissue, probes are detached from a pre-decoded bead array and diffused into tissues, tagging nuclei with spatial barcodes. We reanalyzed this data and discovered a latent, spatially informative cell-bead network formed incidentally from barcode diffusion and the biophysical properties of the tissue. This allows us to treat Slide-tags as a new network-based imaging-by-sequencing approach. By optimizing spatial constraints encoded in the cell-bead network structure, we could achieve unassisted tissue reconstruction, a fundamental shift from classical spatial technologies based on pre-indexed arrays."
"Tumor clearance by T cells is impaired by insufficient tumor antigen recognition, insufficient tumor infiltration, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although targeted T cell therapy circumvents failures in tumor antigen recognition, suppression by the TME and failure to infiltrate the tumor can hinder tumor clearance. Checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) promise to reverse T cell suppression and can be combined with bispecific antibody armed T cell (BATs) therapy to improve clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that adoptively transferred T cell function may be improved by the addition of CPI if the inhibitory pathway is functionally active. This study develops a kinetic-dynamic model of killing of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer cells mediated by BATs using single-cell transcriptomic and temporal protein data to identify T cell phenotypes and quantify inhibitory receptor expression. LAG3, PD-1, and TIGIT were identified as inhibitory receptors expressed by cytotoxic effector CD8 BATs upon exposure to HR+ breast cancer cell lines. These data were combined with real-time tumor cytotoxicity data in a multivariate statistical analysis framework to predict the relevant contributions of T cells expressing each receptor to tumor reduction. A mechanistic kinetic-dynamic mathematical model was developed and parametrized using protein expression and cytotoxicity data for in silico validation of the findings of the multivariate statistical analysis. The model corroborated the predictions of the multivariate statistical analysis which identified LAG3+ BATs as the primary effectors, while TIGIT expression dampened cytotoxic function. These results inform CPI selection for BATs combination therapy and provide a framework to maximize BATs anti-tumor function.

What is already known on this topicBispecific antibody armed T cell (BATs) therapies are adoptive T cell therapies that can effectively reroute T cell cytotoxicity toward cancerous cells, but lack consistent and durable anti-tumor responses. Checkpoint proteins expressed on the surface of activated T cells dampen immune responses and can be overstimulated in solid tumors to hamper tumor clearance by T cells. Checkpoint inhibitor drugs can improve T cell anti-tumor response by blocking checkpoint protein signaling but are only effective if the targeted checkpoint protein is expressed on the T cell and activated in the tumor microenvironment, highlighting an opportunity to enhance BAT efficacy by combining treatment with synergistic CPI.

What this study addsThis study characterizes dynamic, time-resolved patterns in checkpoint protein expression by breast cancer-targeting adoptive T cells and predicts the significance of high-prevalence checkpoint proteins on T cell function. It also demonstrates the use of multivariate statistic and mathematical modeling toward rational design of targets and timing strategies for synergistic combination therapies.

How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThe output of this study provides justification for therapeutic strategies combining adoptive T cell therapies with checkpoint inhibitor drugs targeting TIGIT and LAG3 as a means of improving patient responses in HER2-/HR+ breast cancers."
"Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread malaria species with predominance in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Devising effective controls against P. vivax infections presents unique challenges due to the parasites exclusive invasion of reticulocytes, a transient developmental stage of red blood cells. The ephemeral nature and limited availability of reticulocytes complicate efforts to establish continuous in vitro cultures to study the parasites biology and receptor-ligand interactions. Here, the potential of the erythroid cell lines JK-1 and BEL-A as alternatives to reticulocytes was confirmed through successful parasite invasion, marking the first report of P. vivax entry to BEL-A cells. Furthermore, LC-MS was used to quantitatively compare the membrane proteomes of these cell lines with those of reticulocytes and mature erythrocytes. This analysis revealed significant similarities between the membrane proteomes of JK-1, BEL-A, and reticulocytes. In addition to the known Plasmodium receptors, transferrin receptor protein 1 (TfR1 or CD71), CD98hc, and basigin (BSG), potential receptor candidates involved in the parasites invasion pathway were identified, including prohibitin-2 (PHB2), CAT-1 (SLC7A1), ATB(0) (SLC1A5), CD36, integrin beta-1 (ITGB1), and Metal transporter CNNM3. Proximity labeling using TurboID enabled the identification of specific interactions between PvRBP1a158-650 and TfR1, BSG, and prohibitin-2 in the erythroid cell lines. Notably, this is the first report of prohibitin-2 as a receptor for P. vivax. These findings advance the understanding of P. vivax receptor-ligand interactions and underscore the potential of JK-1 and BEL-A cell lines as alternative models for the study of parasite biology.

Author SummaryPlasmodium vivax is a major cause of malaria, particularly in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Unlike other malaria parasites, it infects only immature red blood cells (reticulocytes), which are rare and short-lived, making laboratory studies challenging. No continuous in vitro culture system currently exists for P. vivax, limiting research into its invasion mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated two erythroid cell lines, JK-1 and BEL-A, as potential reticulocyte surrogates. We demonstrate that P. vivax can invade both cell types, including BEL-A cells, which had not previously been tested. Comparative analysis revealed key differences in surface protein expression between these cell lines and reticulocytes, compared to mature red blood cells, identifying seven potential parasite-receptor proteins. We further applied a proximity-based protein tagging approach to identify host-parasite interactions mediated by a specific P. vivax protein ligand, RBP1a. This technique revealed a potential role for prohibitin-2, TfR1, and basigin in mediating P. vivax entry into red blood cells by RBP1a binding. The role of prohibitin-2 as a Plasmodium receptor is a novel Discovery. Our results highlight JK-1 and BEL-A cells as valuable tools for P. vivax research and suggest new avenues for investigating host-pathogen interactions, with implications for malaria treatment and vaccine development."
"The rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing technologies has spurred the development of numerous computational tools designed to identify gene expression patterns from growing datasets at both bulk and single-cell sequencing levels. The recent advent of longread sequencing technologies has further accelerated the availability and refinement of these tools. The lack of ground-truth labels and annotations in sequencing data presents a significant challenge for evaluating the efficacy of analytical tools. To address this, we developed Tresor, an integrated platform for simulating both short and long reads at bulk and single-cell levels. We devised a tree-based algorithm to significantly accelerate in silico experiments at high PCR cycles. Tresor allows for customising sequencing libraries with highly modular and flexible read structures, facilitating the verification of sequencing-related biological discoveries. This tool also includes features that introduce substitution, insertion, and deletion errors at various stages of library preparation, PCR amplification, and sequencing, enhancing its applicability in diverse experimental conditions and simulating real world conditions. Our results demonstrate that, upon removal of PCR duplicates, cell type-specific gene expression profiles derived from our simulated reads highly resemble reference data. We envisage that Tresor will provide valuable insights into a broader range of transcriptomics analyses and support the development of more effective algorithms for read alignment and UMI deduplication."
"Loss-of-function mutations in TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) are genetically linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and induce cytoplasmic aggregation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), known as TDP-43 pathology. Although TBK1 deficiency is thought to contribute to TDP-43 pathology primarily through impaired autophagy, the full spectrum of its pathological impact remains unclear. Given the multifunctional nature of TBK1, alternative pathways beyond autophagy are possibly involved in TDP-43 pathology. Here, we found that TBK1 alleviates TDP-43 pathology in neuronal cells via induction of interferon-beta (IFN{beta}), and that the IFN{beta} receptor is downregulated in spinal motor neurons from ALS patients with TDP-43 pathology. We further demonstrated that IFN{beta} induces the immunoproteasome by upregulating its subunits, thereby promoting the degradation of aggregation-prone monomeric TDP-43. Furthermore, heterozygous deletion of Tbk1 in SOD1G93A ALS model mice resulted in reduced immunoproteasome induction and increased polyubiquitinated protein accumulation in the spinal cord. These findings suggest that impairment of the TBK1-IFN{beta}-immunoproteasome axis may contribute to the development of TDP-43 pathology in ALS and FTD."
"Molecules of fluorescent proteins (FPs) exhibit anisotropic optical properties. While the directionality of single-photon (1P) absorption and emission in the most commonly used FPs has already been characterized, directionality of their two-photon (2P) excitation remains poorly understood, even though it offers higher sensitivity to molecular orientation and promises to yield more information on molecular orientational distributions than the 1P processes. By measuring optical properties of FP crystals, we have now determined the 2P absorptivity tensors (2PATs) of the FPs mTurquoise2, eGFP and mCherry. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of experimental 2PAT determinations, provide new insights into molecular mechanisms of 2P absorption in FPs, open a new avenue to rational development of novel biosensors and allow detailed structural interpretation of results obtained with such biosensors."
"Individual-based simulation has become an increasingly crucial tool for many fields of population biology. However, continuous geography is important to many applications, and implementing realistic and stable simulations in continuous space presents a variety of difficulties, from modeling choices to computational efficiency. This paper aims to be a practical guide to spatial simulation, helping researchers to implement individual-based simulations and avoid common pitfalls. To do this, we delve into mechanisms of mating, reproduction, density-dependent feedback, and dispersal, all of which may vary across the landscape, discuss how these affect population dynamics, and describe how to parameterize simulations in convenient ways (for instance, to achieve a desired population density). We also demonstrate how to implement these models using the current version of the individual-based simulator, SLiM. We additionally discuss natural selection - in particular, how genetic variation can affect demographic processes. Finally, we provide four short vignettes: simulations of pikas that shift their range up a mountain as temperatures rise; mosquitoes that live in rivers as juveniles and experience seasonally changing habitat; cane toads that expand across Australia, reaching 120 million individuals; and monarch butterflies whose populations are regulated by an explicitly modeled resource (milkweed)."
"Objective: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders, yet existing treatments often result in suboptimal responses and encounter high recurrence rate. Repositioning existing medications, which often significantly reduces the required time and budget, has been demonstrated to be a promising strategy for drug discovery of multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, an efficient modeling strategy of heterogeneous semantic information among biological networks has yet to be developed for drug repurposing. Material and Methods: In this study, we proposed HeteroRepur, by integrating heterogeneous graph neural networks to learn interaction features of Depression Drug Repurposing Graph (DDRG) and then classify drugs. Results: The DDRG embeddings learned by HeteroRepur accurately capture graph information, including 89 types of interaction or associations among drugs, genes, pathways, and GOs, as well as disease genetic network of MDD. In drug classification task, HeteroRepur outperforms various baseline models, including existing graph neural network approaches that do not consider heterogeneous network information. Finally, HeteroRepur predicts new candidates for treating MDD, including CNS drugs that have the potential to be extended to MDD, and dietary supplements that might benefit depression patients by elevating essential nutrient levels. Conclusion: HeteroRepur outperforms traditional graph-based approaches, and can be used to rank promising drugs among complex disease networks with heterogeneous topology"
"Opportunistic assessment of vertebral strength from clinical computed tomography (CT) scans holds substantial promise for fracture risk stratification, yet variability in calibration methods and finite element (FE) modeling approaches has led to limited comparability across studies. In this work, we provide a publicly available benchmark dataset that supports standardized biomechanical analysis of the thoracic and lumbar spine using density-calibrated CT data. We extended the VerSe 2019 dataset to include phantomless quantitative CT calibration, automated vertebral substructure segmentation, and vertebral strength estimates derived from both linear and nonlinear FE models. The cohort comprises 141 patients scanned across five CT systems, including contrast-enhanced protocols. Phantomless calibration was performed using automatically segmented tissue references and validated against synchronous calibration phantoms in 17 scans. To evaluate model performance, we implemented a nonlinear elastoplastic FE model and compared it to two linear estimates. A displacement-calibrated linear model (0.2% axial strain) demonstrated excellent agreement with nonlinear failure loads (R = 0.96; mean difference = -0.07 kN), while a stiffness-based approach showed similarly strong correlation (R = 0.92). We evaluated vertebral strength at all thoracic and lumbar levels, enabling level-wise normalization and comparison. Strength ratios revealed consistent anatomical trends and identified T12 and T9 as reliable alternatives to L1 for opportunistic screening and model standardization. All calibrated scans, segmentations, software, and modeling outputs are publicly released, providing a benchmark resource for validation and development of FE models, radiomics tools, and other quantitative imaging applications in musculoskeletal research."
"Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of severe infections including infective endocarditis, but lineage-specific virulence determinants remain unclear. We analyzed 77 S. aureus bacteremic isolates from major lineages using phenotypic assays, infection models, and transcriptomics. Our results revealed significant heterogeneity in S. aureus pathogenicity. ST398 isolates exhibited heightened virulence, characterized by increased hemolysin production, whereas CC30 strains showed reduced growth, biofilm formation, and infectivity. Notably, the ST398 agrC mutant Sau7 exhibited unique phenotypic behavior, with high biofilm production and decreased virulence in Galleria mellonella larvae model. Infection studies in the rabbit experimental endocarditis model showed increased vegetation size and bacterial load in Sau7-infected animals, highlighting the role of agr system in S. aureus colonization and biofilm formation. Transcriptomic analysis identified key pathways, including quorum sensing systems and hemolysins, driving virulence in ST398 strains. These findings provide insights into the lineage-specific virulence mechanisms and the multifaceted nature of S. aureus pathogenicity."
"Deep learning excels at segmenting objects within noisy cryo-electron tomograms, but the approach is typically bottlenecked by access to ground truth training data. To address this issue we have developed CryoTomoSim (CTS), an open-source software package that builds coarse-grained models of macromolecular complexes embedded in vitreous ice and then simulates transmitted electron tilt series for tomographic reconstruction. Using CTS outputs, we demonstrate the effects of key microscope parameters (dose, defocus, and pixel size) on deep learning-based segmentation, and show that including both molecular crowding and diversity within synthetic datasets is key to training cellular segmentation networks from purely synthetic inputs. While very effective as initial models, the accuracy of these networks is currently limited, and real cellular data is necessary to train the most accurate and generalizable U-Nets. Using a co-training approach, we first segment over 100 tomograms from neuronal growth cones to quantify their cytoskeletal distributions and then we build a generalized cellular cryo-ET segmentation network called NeuralSeg that can segment a subset of cellular features in tomograms from all domains of life."
"Voltage-gated sodium channels undergo reversible voltage/time-dependent transitions from closed to open and inactivated states. The voltage setpoints and efficiency of cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 state transitions are crucial for tuning the initiation and conduction of myocardial action potentials. The channels cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) regulates gating by intramolecular interactions and by serving as a hub for the binding of accessory proteins. We have investigated the roles of the CTD in intrinsic and FGF homologous factor (FHF)-modulated Nav1.5 gating through structure-guided CTD subdomain mutagenesis. The EF-hand module within the CTD was found to exert the most profound effects on channel gating, strongly influencing voltage-dependence of inactivation and activation, accelerating inactivation from the closed state, decelerating inactivation from the open state, minimizing persistent sodium current, and serving as the binding domain for FHF proteins. Nav1.5D1788K bearing a missense mutation in the EF-hand motif displayed a depolarizing shift in voltage dependence of activation and generated greatly enhanced persistent sodium current without altering the voltage dependence of channel inactivation. Reciprocally, Nav1.5L1861A bearing a different missense mutation in the EF-hand underwent closed-state inactivation at more negative membrane potential and at an accelerated rate, but did not display other phenotypes associated with CTD deletion. Nav1.5V1776A/T1778A bearing mutations in the juxtamembrane region between the EF-hand and the channel pore helices displayed wild-type intrinsic gating properties, while FHF modulation of inactivation gating was impaired. Our channel physiology studies together with prior structural data suggest that the voltage and rate of channel inactivation from the closed state are governed by an intramolecular hydrophobic interaction of the CTD EF-hand with the cytoplasmic inactivation loop helix and the extension of this binding interface upon FHF-induced restructuring of the juxtamembrane region, while a distinct CTD intramolecular electrostatic interaction modulates voltage-dependent activation and minimizes persistent sodium current."
"Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) offer a promising balance between quantum mechanical (QM) accuracy and molecular mechanics efficiency. While MLFFs have shown strong performance in modeling short-range interactions and reproducing potential energy surfaces, their ability to capture long-range cooperative effects remains underexplored. In this study, we assess the ability of three MLFF models -- ANI, MACE-OFF, and Orb -- to reproduce cooperative interactions arising from environmental induction and dispersion, which are essential for many biomolecular processes. Using a recently proposed framework, we quantify hydrogen bond (H-bond) cooperativity in N-methylacetamide polymers. Our results show that all MLFFs capture cooperativity to some extent, with MACE-OFF yielding the closest agreement with QM data. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating many-body effects in MLFFs and suggest that H-bond cooperativity can serve as a useful benchmark for improving their physical fidelity."
"Cytosine DNA methylation patterns vary widely across eukaryotes, with its ancestral roles being understood to have included both transposable element silencing and host gene regulation. To further explore these claims, in this study, we reevaluate the evolutionary origins of DNA methyltransferases and characterise the roles of cytosine methylation on underexplored lineages, including the amoebozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii, the glaucophyte Cyanophora paradoxa, and the heterolobosean Naegleria gruberi. Our analysis of DNA methyltransferase evolution reveals a rich ancestral eukaryotic repertoire, with several eukaryotic lineages likely subsequently acquiring enzymes through lateral gene transfer (LGT). In the three species examined, DNA methylation is enriched on young transposable elements and silenced genes, suggesting an ancestral repressive function, without the transcription-linked gene body methylation of plants and animals. Notably, the closest homologues of many of the silenced, methylated genes in diverse eukaryotes belong to viruses, including giant viruses. Given the widespread occurrence of this pattern across diverse eukaryotic groups, we propose that cytosine methylation was a silencing mechanism originally acquired from bacterial donors which was used to mitigate the expression of both transposable and viral elements, and that this function may persist in creating a permissive atmosphere for LGT in diverse eukaryotic lineages. These findings further highlight the importance of epigenetic information to annotate eukaryotic genomes, as it helps delimit potentially adaptive LGTs from silenced parasitic elements."
"Defining cell types using unsupervised clustering algorithms based on transcriptional similarity is a powerful application of single-cell RNA sequencing. A single clustering resolution may not yield clusters that represent both broad, well-defined populations and smaller subpopulations simultaneously. Therefore, when cell identities are not known prior to sequencing, robust comparison and annotation of inferred de novo clusters remains a challenge. In this work, we define the distance between single-cell clusters by proposing the use of the average overlap metric to compare ranked lists of differentially expressed genes in a top-weighted manner. We first benchmark our approach in a truth-known dataset comprised of highly similar yet distinct T-cell populations and show that evaluating clusters with average overlap results in a consistent, precise, and biologically meaningful recapitulation of true cell identities. We then apply our approach to data of unsorted mouse thymocytes and characterize stages of T-cell development in the thymus, including minor populations of double-negative (CD4-CD8-) T-cells that are notoriously difficult to confidently detect in unsorted single-cell data. We demonstrate that measuring cluster similarity with average overlap of marker gene rankings enables robust, reproducible characterization of single cells and clarifies biological interpretation of their underlying identities in highly homogeneous populations."
"Alpha oscillations have been implicated in the maintenance of working memory representations. Notably, when memorised content is spatially lateralised, the power of posterior alpha activity exhibits corresponding lateralisation during the retention interval, consistent with the retinotopic organisation of the visual cortex. Beyond power, alpha frequency has also been linked to memory performance, with faster alpha rhythms associated with enhanced retention. These findings position alpha oscillations as a promising target for neuromodulation.

In this study, we demonstrate that although alpha frequency is not typically lateralised in a retinotopic manner during working memory retention, such lateralisation can be externally induced. Using alpha closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS), and leveraging the phase-dependent responsiveness of alpha oscillations to sound, we successfully modulated alpha frequency asymmetrically between the visual cortices. The extent of induced frequency lateralisation was associated with the behavioural asymmetry in task performance."
"Understanding how microbiomes resist pathogen invasion remains a key challenge in natural ecosystems. Here, we combined genome-scale metabolic models with synthetic community experiments to unravel the mechanisms driving pathogen suppression. We developed curated genome-scale models for each strain, incorporating 48 common resource utilization profiles to fully capture their metabolic capacities. Trophic interactions inferred from models accurately predicted pathogen invasion outcomes, achieving an F1 score of 96% across 620 invasion tests involving diverse microbial communities and nutrient environments. Importantly, considering both substrate and metabolite features provided a more holistic understanding of pathogen suppression. In particular, cross-feeding metabolites within the native community emerged as crucial yet often overlooked predictors of community resistance, disproportionally favoring native species over invaders. This study lays the foundation for designing disease-resistant microbiomes, with broad implications for mitigating pathogen exposure in diverse environments."
"Cortical GABAergic interneurons (INs) expressing the neuropeptide vasoactive-intestinal peptide (VIP) predominantly function by inhibiting dendritic-targeting somatostatin (SST) expressing INs, thereby disinhibiting pyramidal cells (PCs) and facilitating cortical circuit plasticity. VIP INs are a molecularly heterogeneous group, but the physiological significance of this diversity is unclear at present. Here, we have characterized the functional diversity of VIP INs in the primary somatosensory cortex (vS1) using intersectional genetic approaches. We found that VIP INs are comprised of four primary populations that exhibit different laminar distributions, axonal and dendritic arbors, intrinsic electrophysiological properties, and efferent connectivity. Furthermore, we observe that these populations are differentially activated by long-range inputs, and display distinct responses to neuromodulation by endocannabinoids, acetylcholine and noradrenaline. Stimulation of VIP IN subpopulations in vivo results in differential effects on the cortical network, thus providing evidence for specialized modes of VIP IN-mediated regulation of PC activity during cortical information processing."
"Animal models have been instrumental in elucidating the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and testing COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Wild-type (WT) mice are not susceptible to many SARS-CoV-2 variants, therefore transgenic K18-hACE2 mice have emerged as a standard model system. However, this model is characterized by severe disease, particularly associated with neuroinfection, which leads to early humane endpoint euthanasia. Here, we established a novel knock-in (KI) mouse model by inserting the original K18-hACE2 transgene into the collagen COL1A1 locus using a recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) system. Once the Col1a1-K18-hACE2 mouse colony was established, animals were challenged with a B.1 SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) isolate and were monitored for up to 14 days. Col1a1-K18-hACE2 mice exhibited an initial weight loss similar to the K18-hACE2 transgenic model but did not develop evident neurologic clinical signs. The majority of Col1a1-K18-hACE2 mice did not reach the preestablished humane endpoint, showing progressive weight gain after 9 days post-infection (dpi). Importantly, despite this apparent milder pathogenicity of the virus in this mouse model compared to the K18-hACE2 transgenic model, high levels of viral RNA were detected in lungs, oropharyngeal swab, and nasal turbinate. Remaining lesions and inflammation in lungs were still observed after 14 dpi. In contrast, although low level viral RNA could be detected in a minority of Col1a1-K18- hACE2 animals, no brain lesions were observed at any timepoint. Overall, Col1a1-K18- hACE2 mice constitute a new model for investigating SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and treatments, with potential implications for studying long-term COVID-19 sequelae.

ImportanceK18-hACE2 mice express high levels of the human protein ACE2, the receptor for SARS- CoV-2, and can therefore be infected by this virus. These animals have been crucial to understand viral pathogenesis and to test COVID-19 vaccines and antiviral drugs. However, K18-hACE2 often die after infection with initial SARS-CoV-2 variants likely due to a massive brain infection that does not occur in humans. Here, we used a technology known as knock-in that allows for the targeted insertion of a gene into a mouse and we have generated a new hACE2-mouse. We have characterized this new animal model demonstrating that the virus replicates in the respiratory tract, damaging lung tissue and causing inflammation. In contrast to K18-hACE2 mice, only limited or no brain infection could be detected, and most animals recovered from infection with remaining lung lesions. This new model could be instrumental for the study of specific disease aspects such as post-COVID condition, sequelae, and susceptibility to reinfection."
"Classification of patient multicategory survival outcomes is important for personalized cancer treatments. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have increasingly been used to inform healthcare decisions, but these models are vulnerable to biases in data collection and algorithm creation. ML models have previously been shown to exhibit racial bias, but their fairness towards patients from different age and sex groups have yet to be studied. Therefore, we compared the multimetric performances of 5 ML models (random forests, multinomial logistic regression, linear support vector classifier, linear discriminant analysis, and multilayer perceptron) when classifying colorectal cancer patients (n=515) of various age, sex, and racial groups using the TCGA data. All five models exhibited biases for these sociodemographic groups. We then repeated the same process on lung adenocarcinoma (n=589) to validate our findings. Surprisingly, most models tended to perform more poorly overall for the largest sociodemographic groups. Methods to optimize model performance, including testing the model on merged age, sex, or racial groups, and creating a model trained on and used for an individual or merged sociodemographic group, show potential to reduce disparities in model performance for different groups. Notably, these methods may be used to improve ML fairness while avoiding penalizing the model for exhibiting bias and thus sacrificing overall performance."
"Site-directed mutagenesis is a basic molecular tool required for protein, RNA and plasmid engineering. For mutagenesis methods, an ideal goal is to reach the efficiency of 100%. Towards this goal, we have recently taken the first step by adopting an innovative strategy using primer pairs with 3'-overhangs and developing P3 site-directed mutagenesis, with an average efficiency of [~]50%. As the second step towards the ideal goal, we report here P3a site-directed mutagenesis with an efficiency reaching [~]100%. We systematically evaluated this new method by engineering >100 point mutations and small deletions (or insertions) on >20 mammalian expression vectors encoding various epigenetic regulators and the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Aa all known mutagenesis methods are limited to point mutations and small deletions/insertions (up to a dozen nucleotides), the technical problem is how to carry out cassette mutagenesis for replacement, deletion or insertion of large DNA fragments. The high efficiency of P3a mutagenesis and the  handshaking feature of primer pairs with 3'-overhangs inspired us to adapt this new method for seamless cassette mutagenesis, including highly efficient epitope tagging and untagging, deletion of small and large DNA fragments (up to 5 kb) and insertion of primer pairs possessing LoxP sites, degrons, sgRNA- or tigRNA-encoding sequences, and gene fragments (up to [~]0.4 kb). Thus, this new site-specific and cassette mutagenesis method is highly efficient, fast and versatile, likely resulting in its wide use for typical biomedical research, as well as for engineering and refining synthetic proteins from AI-assisted design."
"Strigolactones (SLs) are not only phytohormones that influence multiple aspects of plant growth and development, but also signaling molecules for interactions between plants and certain fungi or bacteria. In plants, the SL receptor is an /{beta}-hydrolase (ABH) encoded by the D14/KAI2 gene family, which is known to be derived from proteobacterial RsbQ through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Here we show that the CpD14-like (CDL) gene family, which encodes another ABH exhibiting SL receptor functions in fungi, was acquired from actinobacteria via an independent HGT event. X-ray crystallographic experiments reveal that CDL and D14/KAI2/RsbQ (DKR) proteins have distinctive lid structures but maintain the same core  /{beta} fold and catalytic triad. Biochemical assays further show that both actinobacterial CDL and proteobacterial RsbQ can recognize and hydrolyze SLs, suggesting that they are pre-adapted for SL perception. This work demonstrates that independent HGT of pre-adapted genes can trigger convergent evolution of key innovations and provides insights into how SLs are sensed by organisms across kingdoms."
"Plasmodesmata (PD) are specialized structures in plant cell walls that mediate intercellular communication by regulating the trafficking of molecules between adjacent cells. The actin cytoskeleton plays a pivotal role in controlling PD permeability, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation remain unclear. Here, we report that BRK1, a component of the WAVE/SCAR complex involved in Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation, localizes to PD and primary pit fields in Arabidopsis cotyledons, leaves, and hypocotyls. Using a BRK1-YFP reporter line, we detected BRK1 enrichment at cell edges and in primary pit fields, identified by regions of reduced propidium iodide staining. We also observed colocalization between BRK1-YFP and the PD callose stain aniline blue, further supporting BRK1s association with PD. Together, these findings suggest that the WAVE/SCAR complex participates in PD regulation by promoting ARP2/3-dependent actin filament branching at PD, complementing the role of linear actin stabilization by formins."
"The phylloplane of edible and culinary plants harbours diverse microbial communities, including lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which remain underexplored for their probiotic potential. This study aimed to isolate LAB from the leaf surfaces of eight plant species: Sauropus androgynus, Piper betle, Centella asiatica, Artocarpus heterophyllus, Pandanus amaryllifolius, Musa paradisiaca, Curcuma longa, and Ricinus communis. The isolates were characterized for essential probiotic traits, including tolerance to acid, bile salts, NaCl, and phenol, temperature resistance, haemolytic activity, antibiotic susceptibility, auto-aggregation, and cell surface hydrophobicity. All LAB isolates exhibited {gamma}-haemolytic activity, confirming their non-pathogenic nature. Notably, Lactobacillus acidophilus and LAB-10 displayed superior gastrointestinal stress tolerance, high hydrophobicity (72% and 60%, respectively), and strong auto-aggregation (42% and 36%). These strains tolerated NaCl concentrations up to 6%, phenol (0.4%), and grew optimally at 37-40{square}{degrees}C and pH 2.0-3.5. Antibiotic susceptibility varied, with some isolates resistant to multiple antibiotics. This study highlights the phylloplane as a valuable source of probiotic LAB strains with functional attributes suitable for potential applications in functional foods and therapeutic formulations."
"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe, progressive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Sleep problems are frequently reported in Rett Syndrome, but the exact nature remains relatively unexplored. Currently there is limited understanding the role of MECP2 in sleep architecture and regulation. In this study, we employed longitudinal electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings to investigate sleep architecture during baseline conditions as well as the homeostatic response to sleep deprivation (SD) in Mecp2-/y male mice. At baseline, Mecp2-/y mice have more non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep and less rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep than their wildtype littermates during the light period. However, Mecp2-/y mice display altered sleep timing during the dark period, spending more time in both NREM and REM during the first half and less time during the second half. We also observe differences in REM sleep and wake quality based on spectral properties of the EEG. In response to SD, Mecp2-/y mice can accumulate and discharge sleep pressure normally and show a sleep rebound. However, baseline differences in sleep architecture are heightened after SD. Overall, our findings show that RTT mice exhibit distinct sleep patterns compared to wildtype mice, with time-of-day-dependent variations in NREM and REM sleep, as well as altered EEG spectral properties, that become more pronounced following SD. Future research should explore the molecular mechanisms through which MECP2 regulates circadian sleep architecture to develop targeted therapeutics for sleep disturbances in RTT patients.

"Muller cells are the most abundant glial cell type in the human and mouse retina, playing a crucial role in maintaining retinal homeostasis. However, many aspects of Muller cell function remain poorly characterized. In this study, we reanalyzed a single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset from Aire-/- mice, focusing on Muller cells and T cells. We identified nine distinct Muller cell subgroups and five T cell subgroups, with activated Muller cells comprising the majority of the Muller cells in the inflamed retina. Using SCassist, an AI-based workflow assistant for single-cell analysis, we created a comparison matrix to quantify pathway involvement in each Muller cell subset. This approach unveils the functional dynamics of Muller cells during retinal inflammation. Activated Muller cells primarily exhibit enhanced inflammatory activity and adopt a macrophage or dendritic-cell-like phenotype, in the presence or absence of increased neuronal activity. These changes are primarily driven by Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs), acting alone or in concert with Neuronal Differentiation 1 (NEUROD1). We further inferred the interactions between Muller cells and T cells and found that activated Muller cells do not appear to exhibit extra chemoattraction to Th1 cells compared to other Muller cell subsets, but they do show such effects on the Th1-like regulatory T cells (Tregs). Activated Muller cells display nearly exclusive expression of immune checkpoint molecules, primarily targeting Th1 cells. These findings may uncover a previously unrecognized role for activated Muller cells in attenuating Th1 cell activity."
"In 2023, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) heavily affected gulls in Europe. In July, a mass mortality event was reported in the Black-legged Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) breeding colony at Ekkeroy in Northern Norway. The cause was confirmed to be infection with the HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus, genotype EA-2022-BB. We describe the outbreak in Kittiwakes, including pathological and virological investigations, and discuss the management and zoonotic potential. With more than 15,000 dead birds reported, we estimate that the outbreak caused a reduction in the Kittiwake population at Ekkeroy of at least 50%. Diseased birds exhibited neurological signs. Necropsy of ten birds revealed a peracute fatal systemic disease, with severe lesions in the brain and pancreas co-localizing with the presence of viral RNA and antigen. Vascular expression of 2,3-linked sialic acids and viral RNA/antigen may reflect hematogenous virus spread. Further studies should investigate the long-term impact of HPAI on Kittiwake populations."
"A key mechanism of antiviral antibodies is to bind cell-surface viral antigens and activate cellular immunity to clear infected cells, yet antibodies targeting human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) have exhibited limited efficacy. This appears due to HCMVs multiple immune evasion mechanisms, including viral receptors (vFc{gamma}Rs) which bind human IgG Fc domains to co-operatively inhibit Fc activation of host Fc{gamma} receptors and impair Fc-mediated effector functions. We biochemically characterized and evaluated the functions of two highly conserved vFc{gamma}Rs, gp34 and gp68, and mapped their binding epitopes on the Fc domain. Based on this information, we then engineered Fc variants that retain binding to CD16A, which is essential for NK activation, and to FcRn but have markedly attenuated binding to gp34 and gp68. IgG1 antibodies targeting the gB fusogen with engineered Fc domains were not internalized by infected cells, mediated enhanced CD16A activation and limited viral spread in HCMV-infected fibroblasts more effectively than wild-type Fc. Together, this work demonstrates a strategy to enhance the efficacy of antibody therapies to clear HCMV infections.

"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels and the main mediators of synaptic neurotransmission in the insect brain. In insects, nAChRs are pivotal for sensory processing, cognition and motor control, and are the primary target of neonicotinoid insecticides. Neonicotinoids are potent neurotoxins and pollinators such as honey bees are more sensitive and affected by extremely low sub-lethal doses. The pentameric nAChR channel is made up either of five -subunits constituting five ligand-binding sites or a mixture of two to three  and {beta} subunits constitute two to three ligand-binding sites. Of particular note, the honey bee nAChR8 subunit is converted into a {beta} subunit (nAChR{beta}2) in Drosophila, raising the question whether this  to {beta} conversion makes flies less sensitive to neonicotinoids. To investigate species-specific aspects of neonicotinoid toxicity we CRISPR-Cas9 engineered a cross-species chimeric nAChR subunit by swapping the ligand-binding domain in Drosophila of nAChR{beta}2 with honey bee nAChR8. Toxicity assessment by neonicotinoid thiamethoxam revealed significantly impaired motor functions in climbing and flight assays when comparing the 8/{beta}2 chimeric channel to wild type or a {beta}2 knock-out. However, both the 8/{beta}2 chimeric channel and the {beta}2 knock-out showed the same increased survival after neonicotinoid exposure compared to wild type flies. Combinatorial exposure to neonicotinoids also did not reveal differences. These findings highlight the critical role of nAChR subunit composition in motor control and demonstrate how subtle structural differences can profoundly impact motor function and pesticide response, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity across species."
"Proteins operate through ligand and solvent interactions governed by thermodynamics, yet the enthalpy-entropy trade-offs that guide their functional evolution remain poorly understood. The LacI/GalR family (LGF) of transcription factors provides a system for examining how these trade-offs evolve over billions of years but has seldom been studied from a full thermodynamic perspective. While the evolution of ligand specificity has been well-studied, the thermodynamic determinants underlying the changes in specificity is not well understood - especially how proteins alter thermodynamic strategies to optimize affinity. By reconstructing LGF ancestors, we reveal a shift from entropy-driven binding in the most distant ancestor, to enthalpy-driven binding in the most recent ancestor and extant LacI. The most distant ancestor is characterized by the ability to bind its ligand in an open and dynamic conformation, and we propose that entropically-driven binding is driven by the presence of entropic reservoirs. This thermodynamic binding trade-off between the most distant and most recent ancestor is in accordance with the concept of ancient life that existed in a hot Earth environment, where higher temperatures enhanced entropically-driven binding. This suggests that molecular binding mechanisms evolved not just for ligand specificity, but to adapt to environmental pressures such as cooling Earth temperatures where enthalpic binding modes are favored."
"Perinatal exposure to the organophosphorus insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) is associated with an increased incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder. While these behavioral detriments have been modeled in rodents, the underlying functional alterations in the developing brain are largely unknown. Previous reports using a rat model have identified alterations to both inhibitory synaptic transmission and serotonergic (5-HT) receptor binding in the cortex following developmental CPF exposure.

Here, we use a rat model of gestational CPF exposure to investigate whether this altered inhibitory activity is driven by increased spontaneous firing of inhibitory interneurons and altered 5-HT receptor expression. Using cell-attached ex vivo electrophysiology in young rats of both sexes, we identified a significant increase in the number of spontaneously firing neurons in the somatosensory cortex of CPF-exposed offspring. Analysis of action potential metrics identified a sub-set of these neurons as fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV) interneurons. Immunohistochemical labeling of c-Fos, a marker of neuronal activity, further revealed a pronounced increase in activity of neurons of the somatosensory cortex in both juvenile and adult rats that had been gestationally exposed to CPF. Finally, RNAscope in situ hybridization showed an increase in the expression of the inhibitory receptor 5-HT1B in PV neurons. The data here demonstrate that gestational exposure to CPF results in persistent hyper-excitation of the somatosensory cortex, potentially through increased expression of the receptor 5-HT1B and resulting disinhibition. These neurophysiological effects may contribute to the established behavioral outcomes resulting from gestational exposure to CPF and offer guidance for novel preventative interventions.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe report persistent increases in spontaneous neuronal firing in the somatosensory cortex following a brief gestational exposure to the organophosphorus insecticide CPF in rats. This occurred in conjunction with increased expression of the 5-HT1B receptor measured specifically in PV interneurons. The hyper-excitability of the somatosensory cortex described here agrees with the established hyper-sensitivity to sensory stimulation seen in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder. These results offer a possible mechanistic framework underlying the neurophysiological effects associated with early life exposures to the organophosphorus insecticide CPF."
"Acropora is the most diverse and widespread coral genus in the world. Although known for its critical ecological role in shallow-water habitats, its abundance and diversity at upper mesophotic depths have only recently been uncovered. Consequently, little is known about the genetic structuring of mesophotic Acropora populations and their potential ecological and evolutionary relationships with shallow populations. Here, we present the first population genomic evaluation of the depth-generalist coral Acropora aculeus to assess genetic structuring across depths (10 and 40 m) and regions (the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and the Western Coral Sea (WCS)). We observed strong geographic differentiation between regions, indicating the relative isolation of WCS atolls, with some gene flow occurring from WCS to the GBR, but rarely in the opposite direction. Conversely, we observed no geographic or depth-related genetic structuring within regions, although sample sizes limited the evaluation of local allelic patterns of depth structuring. Our results indicate that widespread connectivity within regions characterizes the broadcast spawning A. aculeus. The lack of depth differentiation should be explored to see whether the wide depth range of some species may be safeguarded against a rapidly changing climate."
"Climate change represents a major challenge for avian species. It is characterized by an increase in average ambient temperatures, but also in occurrence of extreme weather events, such as heat weaves and cold snaps. These abrupt temperature changes can modify the immediate and long-term survival prospects of nestling birds, when their thermoregulatory capacities are still not fully developed. While immediate nestling survival can easily be measured, long-term survival is more challenging to evaluate. Early-life telomere length has been suggested as a potential biomarker of future fitness prospects. To evaluate the potential impact of changes in early-life temperature, we thus experimentally increased (ca. +2.8{degrees}C) and decreased (ca. -1.7{degrees}C) average nestbox temperatures in wild pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) during nestling postnatal growth, and measured nestling telomere length before fledging. Shorter telomeres were observed in individuals exposed both to an experimental heating or cooling during growth. Our results suggest that long-term survival prospects or long-term performances of individuals exposed to abrupt changes in early-life temperature may be decreased.

"Alzheimers disease pathology typically manifests itself across multiple brain regions yet assessment at this scale in mouse models remains a challenge. This hinders the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Here we introduce a novel fiber photometry approach to monitor amyloid pathology in freely behaving mice. We first demonstrated that flat fiber-based photometry can detect amyloid signals across multiple brain regions under anesthesia after injecting a blood-brain barrier permeable tracer, Methoxy-X04. The depth profile of in vivo fluorescent signals was correlated with postmortem histological plaque signals. After confirming its feasibility ex vivo, we chronically implanted a tapered fiber for depth-resolved fiber photometry in freely behaving mice. After injecting Methoxy-X04, fluorescent signals increased in a depth-specific manner in Alzheimers mice, but not in wild-type littermates. While fiber photometry has been widely adopted to monitor neuronal and non-neuronal activity, our approach expands the capabilities to monitor molecular pathologies such as amyloid plaques, even in a freely behaving condition."
"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number regulation remains incompletely understood, despite its importance in cellular function. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mrx6 belongs to the Pet20-domain-containing protein family, consisting of Mrx6, Pet20, and Sue1. Notably, absence of Mrx6 leads to increased mtDNA copy number. Here, we identify the C-terminus of Mrx6 as essential for its stability and interaction with the mitochondrial matrix protein Mam33. Deletion of Mam33 mimics the effect of Mrx6 loss, resulting in elevated mtDNA copy number. Bioinformatics, mutational analyses, and immunoprecipitation studies reveal that a subcomplex of Mam33 and Mrx6 trimers interacts with the substrate recognition domain of the conserved mitochondrial Lon protease Pim1 through a bipartite motif in the Pet20 domain of Mrx6. Loss of Mrx6, its paralog Pet20, Mam33, or mutations disrupting the interaction between Mrx6 and Pim1 stabilize key proteins required for mtDNA maintenance, the RNA polymerase Rpo41 and the HMG-box-containing protein Cim1. We propose that Mrx6, alongside Pet20 and Mam33, regulates mtDNA copy number by modulating substrate degradation through Pim1. Additionally, Mrx6 loss alters Cim1s function, preventing the detrimental effect on mtDNA maintenance observed upon Cim1 overexpression. The presence of three Pet20-domain proteins in yeast implies broader roles of Lon protease substrate recognition beyond mtDNA regulation."
"Animals respond to environmental cues to time phenological events, but the intrinsic mechanism of circannual timing remains elusive. We used transcriptomic sequencing and frequent sampling, during three distinct phases (induction, maintenance and recovery) of circannual interval timing for Djungarian hamster energy balance, to investigate the molecular architecture of a neuroendocrine seasonal clock. Our study identified three distinct phases of transcript changes, with deiodinase type-3 (Dio3) expression activated during the early induction phase. Subsequent work demonstrated that targeted mutation of Dio3 resulted in a shorter period for circannual interval timing. Hamsters that exhibit naturally disrupted Dio3 expression do not show any change in body mass or pelage. Our work demonstrates that changes in Dio3 induction is essential for setting the period of circannual interval timing."
"Pathological chronic stress is stress exceeding the organisms ability to cope physiologically, which may act as a risk factor in the onset and relapse of alcohol use disorder. Chronic- restraint stress (CRS) and ethanol intake are independently known to induce changes in brain structure and function, however, their combined effects on neurodevelopment over long periods of time remains largely unexplored. We conducted an in vivo longitudinal rat model with three main goals. 1) to determine if chronic stress increases ethanol intake; 2) to determine the effect of chronic- stress and ethanol intake in behavioral measures, brain structure, and function; and 3) to investigate the effect of sex. This observational study included Wistar rats assigned to four groups: 1) ethanol consumption (EtOH+/CRS-), 2) stress exposure (EtOH-/CRS+), 3) both ethanol and stress exposure (EtOH+/CRS+), and 4) control group (EtOH-/CRS-). Our results showed that chronic stress did not affect ethanol intake but led to reduced body weight gain, elevated corticosterone levels, and impaired recognition memory. Structural MRI revealed that both exposures produced additive brain volume changes in regions such as the olfactory bulb, orbitofrontal cortex, caudate-putamen, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Functional connectivity analysis using network-based statistics identified disrupted cortical-subcortical connections. Results found here were sex-dependent in terms of volumetric changes (higher effects on males) and functional connectivity (higher effects on females). Findings suggest sex-dependent mechanisms where both chronic- ethanol intake and stress affect brain plasticity during neurodevelopment. Understanding these region-specific vulnerabilities is crucial for addressing alcohol use disorders and stress-related neuropathology.

"Epigenetic mechanisms are mediators of interactions between aging, genetics, and environmental factors in sporadic Parkinsons disease (PD). Multiple studies have explored the DNA modifications in PD, but few focus on 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), which is important in the central nervous system and sensitive to environmental exposures. To date, studies have not differentiated between 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hmC or have analyzed them separately. In this study, we modeled paired 5-mC and 5-hmC data simultaneously. We identified 108 cytosines with significant PD-associated shifts between these marks in an enriched neuronal population from PD postmortem parietal cortex, within 83 genes and 34 enhancers associated with 67 genes. These data potentially link epigenetic regulation of genes related to LRRK2 and endolysosomal sort (RAB32 and AGAP1), and genes involved in neuroinflammation, the inflammasome, and neurodevelopment with early changes in PD and suggest that there are significant shifts between 5mC and 5hmC associated with PD in genes not captured by standard methods."
"Transposable elements are abundant in host genomes but are generally considered to be confined to the cell in which they are expressed, with the notable exception of endogenous retroviruses. Here, we identify a group of LTR retrotransposons that infect the germline from somatic cells within the Drosophila ovary, despite lacking the fusogenic Envelope protein typically required for retroviral entry. Instead, these elements encode a short transmembrane protein, sORF2, with structural features reminiscent of viral cell-cell fusogens. Through genetics, imaging, and electron microscopy, we show that sORF2 localizes to invasive somatic protrusions, enabling the direct transfer of retrotransposon capsids into the oocyte. Remarkably, sORF2-like proteins are widespread among insect retrotransposons and also occur in piscine nackednaviruses and avian picornaviruses. These findings reveal a noncanonical, Envelope-independent transmission mechanism shared by retrotransposons and non-enveloped viruses, offering important insights into host-pathogen evolution and soma-germline interactions."
"Animals are typically expected to avoid mating with relatives due to the costs associated with incestuous matings. Yet for more than four decades, theoretical models have consistently suggested that animals should tolerate, or even prefer, mating with relatives under a broad range of conditions. However, empirical studies that evaluate inbreeding avoidance under alternative social and sexual contexts remain scarce. Here, we investigate how experimental variation in sexual and social complexity influence precopulatory inbreeding avoidance behaviors in the guppy Poecilia reticulata, a species known to experience inbreeding depression. In an integrated set of experiments, we examined if sexual and affiliative behaviors of virgin and experienced females and males were differentially directed towards either related or unrelated individuals. In simplistic social interactions, neither virgin nor experienced females or males showed a preference for related or unrelated partners. In contrast, we detected sex-specific responses to relatives in the more sexually and socially complex free-swimming arenas. Females exhibited a stronger preference towards related males regardless of mating experience, while male preference remained unchanged. Overall, these findings challenge previous reports of preference shifts between virgin and experienced female guppies and suggest that inbreeding avoidance behaviors may be less prevalent in complex social environments than previously thought."
"In germ cells, small RNAs function as a defense system to silence invading RNAs like viruses and transposons to protect genome integrity. The ability of small RNAs to robustly silence diverse RNA sequences prompts the question of how endogenous mRNAs avoid this silencing. In C. elegans, small RNAs bound by the Argonaute CSR-1 protect endogenous mRNAs from silencing, while also fine-tuning a subset of these mRNAs. Here, we identify RNA Helicase A (RHA-1) as a key regulator of CSR-1 small RNA biogenesis and function in mRNA fine-tuning. RHA-1 localizes to germ granules dependent on EGO-1, which synthesizes CSR-1 small RNAs. We find RHA-1 promotes small RNA production from the 5 regions of mRNAs and small RNA sorting to CSR-1. Loss of RHA-1 leads to elevated CSR-1 target mRNA levels and compromised fertility. Our study highlights the importance of small RNA regulation, mediated by RHA-1, to protect endogenous gene expression programs and germ cell function."
"Embryo development is driven by the spatiotemporal dynamics of complex gene regulatory networks. Uncovering these dynamics requires simultaneous tracking of multiple fluctuating molecular species over time, which exceeds the capabilities of traditional live-imaging approaches. Fixed-embryo imaging offers the necessary sensitivity and capacity but lacks temporal resolution. Here, we present a multi-scale ensemble deep learning approach to precisely infer absolute developmental time with 1-minute resolution from nuclear morphology in fixed Drosophila embryo images. Applying this approach to quantitative imaging of fixed wild-type embryos, we resolve the spatiotemporal regulation of the endogenous segmentation gene Kruppel (Kr) by multiple transcription factors (TFs) during early development without genetic modification. Integrating a time-resolved theoretical model of single-molecule mRNA statistics, we further uncover the unsteady-state bursty kinetics of the endogenous segmentation gene, hunchback (hb), driven by dynamic TF binding. Our method provides a versatile framework for deciphering complex gene network dynamics in genetically unmodified organisms."
"BackgroundInfluenza A virus (IAV) poses a significant threat to animal health globally, with its ability to overcome species barriers and cause pandemics. Rapid and accurate prediction of IAV subtypes and host source is crucial for effective surveillance and pandemic preparedness. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing viral genomic sequences, offering new ways to uncover hidden patterns associated with viral characteristics and host adaptation.

FindingsWe introduce WaveSeekerNet, a novel deep learning model for accurate and rapid prediction of IAV subtypes and host source. The model leverages attention-based mechanisms and efficient token mixing schemes, including the Fast Fourier Transform and the Wavelet Transform, to capture intricate patterns within viral RNA and protein sequences. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate WaveSeekerNets superior performance compared to existing Transformer-only models. Notably, WaveSeekerNet achieves scores of up to the maximum 1.0 across all evaluation metrics, including F1-score (Macro Average), Balanced Accuracy and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), in subtype prediction, even for rare subtypes. Furthermore, WaveSeekerNet exhibits remarkable accuracy in distinguishing between human, avian, and other mammalian hosts. The ability of WaveSeekerNet to flag potential cross-species transmission events underscores its significant value for real-time surveillance and proactive pandemic preparedness efforts.

ConclusionsWaveSeekerNets superior performance, efficiency, and ability to flag potential cross-species transmission events highlight its potential for real-time surveillance and pandemic preparedness. This model represents a significant advancement in applying deep learning for IAV classification and holds promise for future epidemiological and veterinary studies, and public health interventions.

"Studying the evolution of gene orders is essential to our understanding of the link between gene regulation and phenotype. Comparative studies concerning the full complement of genes in large numbers of genomes are now possible, thanks to the advent of affordable long-read sequencing and whole chromosome assembly, combined with automated genome annotation. The study of gene orders remains cumbersome, however, due to a lack of a streamlined, and standardized, process meant for the identification of positional orthologs. Within a family of homologous genes, these are those pairs of orthologous gene copies that descend from the same locus in their most recent ancestor, not having been produced by an intervening duplication event. This article approaches the detection of positional orthologs by way of the MAXIMUM COLORFUL GRAPH PARTITION Problem. We present two novel integer linear programming solutions to this problem, evaluate their efficacy on simulated and real data, while comparing them to several new and existing heuristics, as well as to the Double Cut and Join based ILP called FFGC.

"Exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC1), a multifunctional intracellular cAMP receptor, dynamically localizes to various cellular loci, engaging with diverse molecular partners to maintain cellular homeostasis. The study investigates the role of the SUMO interacting motif (SIM) in the subcellular targeting and cellular functions of EPAC1. It reveals that the SIM is a critical structural element for EPAC1s association with RanBP2/Nup358, a nucleoporin of the cytoplasmic filament component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Mutational disruption of EPAC1 SIM interferes with EPAC1s ability to activate its canonical effectors, small GTPases, Rap1 and Rap2, and non-canonical functions, such as the formation of nuclear condensates and cellular SUMOylation. Because SIM is also directly involved in cAMP binding, RanBP2s association with EPAC1 with the SIM attenuates EPAC1s cAMP binding affinity to generate an EPAC1 signaling microdomain with reduced cAMP sensitivity around the NPC. The coupling between EPAC1s scaffold association and cAMP binding enables EPAC1 to tune its sensitivity to stress stimuli spatially depending on the cellular locations. These findings provide novel structural insights into EPAC1 signaling, highlighting the importance of SIM in EPAC1s cellular functions and potential novel strategies for therapeutically targeting EPAC1."
"BackgroundOur prior work demonstrated that estimated structural and functional connectomes (eSC and eFC) generated using multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion masks and artificial intelligence (AI) models can predict disability as effectively as SC and FC derived from diffusion and functional MRI in MS. The goal of this study was to assess the ability of eSC and eFC in predicting baseline and 4-year follow-up cognition in MS patients.

MethodsOne hundred seventy-one MS patients (age: 42.67{+/-}10.41, 74% females) were included. The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMT) were used to assess cognition. The Network Modification tool was performed to estimate SC, which was then used as an input to Krakencoder, an encoder-decoder model, to estimate FC. Ridge regression was performed to predict cognition using regional eSC and eFC, along with demographics and clinical information as well as conventional MRI metrics. Baseline cognition was added to the models that were used to predict the follow-up cognition. Spearmans correlation (r) was used to assess the prediction accuracy.

ResultsThe highest accuracy was obtained when predicting follow-up SDMT using regional eSC or eFC (median r=0.58 for eSC and r=0.56 for eFC). Decreased eSC and eFC in the cerebellum and increased eFC in the default mode network were associated with lower follow-up SDMT scores. Baseline SDMT, clinical subtype, and age were the most important non-connectome metrics in predicting follow-up SDMT.

ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that eSC and eFC derived from clinically acquired MRI and AI models can effectively predict cognition. The use of lesion-based estimates of connectome disruptions may potentially improve cognition-related individualized treatment planning."
"Growth rate, a fundamental biological trait influencing plant resource use, scales predictably with plant mass, following remarkably consistent allometric power laws shaped by biophysical constraints and natural selection. However, how these laws apply to crop plants shaped by artificial selection, and how they manifest in agronomic traits, remains undefined. Under controlled greenhouse conditions, we quantified the relationship between plant mass and growth rate in 195 European winter wheat cultivars. We uncovered genetic variation in allometry linked to plant size, where increased leaf allocation and faster development elevated allometric exponents. Phenotypic and genetic analyses revealed adaptive strategies, ranging from large, slow-growing genotypes that support reproductive initiation to small, fast-growing genotypes that enhance reproductive effort. A shared genetic basis--associated with Photoperiod response-1 (Ppd-1)--linked growth allometry in the greenhouse to genotype-by-environment interactions for grain yield in field trials. This variation in growth allometry, shaped by breeding in diverse environments, reflects strategies that enhance adaptation to weather conditions. Our findings demonstrate that growth allometry is biologically robust and agronomically important because it scales to wheat yield under diverse, realistic field conditions."
"Ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapies severely impair hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) function, causing bone marrow failure and secondary malignancies. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) within the hematopoietic niche support HSPC survival and regeneration, but the underlying pro-survival mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that MSCs suppress IR-induced apoptosis in human HSPCs and preserve their regenerative capacity. Transcriptomic analyses identified a robust induction of CREB target genes in HSPCs upon MSC contact, driven by MSC-secreted prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) via cAMP signaling. While MSC-derived PGE2 predominantly protected quiescent HSPCs from IR-induced apoptosis, direct pharmacological elevation of cAMP with Forskolin/IBMX (FSKN/IBMX) effectively shielded both quiescent and cycling HSPCs, significantly enhancing their engraftment and self-renewal. Mechanistically, cAMP pathway activation reduced pro-apoptotic ASPP1 and PUMA expression, elevated p21, and stabilized anti-apoptotic MCL1 and BCL-XL proteins. Collectively, our study uncovers an MSC-driven PGE2/CREB signaling pathway critical for human HSPC regeneration, highlighting pharmacological modulation of this axis as a promising strategy to mitigate DNA damage-induced myelosuppression and improve transplantation outcomes."
"The lysosomal damage response is important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Although the mechanisms underlying the repair and autophagic elimination of damaged lysosomes have been elucidated, the early signal transduction pathways and genes induced in response to lysosomal damage remain elusive. We performed transcriptome and proteome analyses and found that the TAB-TAK1-IKK-NF-{kappa}B axis is activated by K63-linked ubiquitin chains that accumulate on damaged lysosomes. This activates the expression of various transcription factors and cytokines that promote anti-apoptosis and intercellular signaling. The findings highlight the crucial role of ubiquitin-regulated signal transduction and gene expression in cell survival and cell-cell communication in response to lysosomal damage. The results suggest that the ubiquitin system is not only involved in the removal of damaged lysosomes by lysophagy, but also functions in the activation of cellular signaling for cell survival."
"Working memory (WM) is distributed across multiple cortical areas, suggesting that behaviors relying on WM arise from interactions between these regions. In a recent study, we found that during delayed comparison tasks, the first stimulus is not represented veridically in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but instead is encoded in a systematically warped manner--biased toward the mean of the stimulus distribution. This neural distortion, which emerges already during the stimulus presentation and persists throughout the delay period, closely mirrors a contraction bias observed in behavior. Furthermore, the behavioral responses could be explained by a Bayesian observer model, in which the brain integrates prior expectations with noisy sensory inputs. These results suggest that the geometry of PFC neural trajectories embodies Bayesian estimates that underlie biased decisions. Here, we investigate whether the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2)--a lower-level sensory area also implicated in tactile WM--exhibits a similar encoding structure. Our analyses reveal that although WM-related signals in S2 are less robust than in PFC, the neural state space in S2 shares key geometric features with that of PFC, including a similarly warped representation of stimulus values. These findings suggest that perceptual biases may originate early in the cortical processing stream and are not exclusively shaped by higher-order associative areas. More broadly, our results support a distributed organization of WM, in which even sensory areas contribute to the formation of bias-prone representations that guide behavior."
"Specialized transposable elements capable of generating introns, termed introners, are one of the major drivers of intron gain in eukaryotes. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is thought to play an important role in shaping introner distributions. Viruses could function as vehicles of introner HGT since they often integrate into host genomes and have been implicated in widespread HGT in eukaryotes. We annotated integrated viral elements in diverse dinoflagellate genomes with active introners and queried viral elements for introner sequences. We find that 25% of viral elements contain introners. The vast majority of viral elements represent maverick-polinton-like double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses as well as giant dsDNA viruses. By querying a previously annotated set of maverick-polinton-like proviruses, we show that introners populate full-length elements with machinery required for transposition as well as viral infection. Introners in the vast majority of viral elements are younger than or similar in age to others in their host genome, suggesting that most viral elements acquired introners after integration. However, a subset of viral elements show the opposite pattern wherein viral introners are significantly older than other introners, possibly consistent with virus-to-host horizontal transfer. Together, our results suggest that dsDNA viruses may serve as vectors for HGT of introners between individuals and species, resulting in the introduction of intron-generating transposons to new lineages."
"The fine-grained functional organization of the human lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) remains poorly understood. Previous fMRI studies delineated focal domain-general, or multiple-demand (MD), PFC areas that co-activate during diverse cognitively demanding tasks. While there is some evidence for category-selective (face and scene) patches, in human and non-human primate PFC, these have not been systematically assessed. Recent precision fMRI studies have also revealed sensory-biased PFC patches adjacent to MD regions. To investigate if this topographic arrangement extends to other domains, we analysed two independent fMRI datasets (n=449 and n=37) utilizing the high-resolution multimodal MRI approaches of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Both datasets included cognitive control tasks and stimuli spanning different categories: faces, places, tools and body parts. Contrasting each stimulus category against the remaining ones revealed focal interdigitated patches of activity located adjacent to core MD regions. The face and place results were robust, replicating across different executive tasks, experimental designs (block and event-related) and at the single subject level. In one dataset, where participants performed both category and sensory tasks, place patches overlapped with visually biased regions, while face patches were positioned between visual and auditory biases. Our results paint a refined view of the fine-grained functional organization of the PFC, revealing a recurring motif of interdigitated domain-specific and domain-general circuits. This organization offers new constraints for models of cognitive control, cortical specialization and development."
"PD-1+Tcf1+ stem-like cells are critical mediators of endogenous T cell responses to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and are maintained by MHC-dependent interactions with professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Unlike conventional T cells, CAR-T cells are activated by intact antigen expressed on tumors, not by peptide/MHC expressed on APCs, restricting their activation to the hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) that may impair preservation of this critical stem-like subset. Indeed, in an autochthonous model of ROR1+ lung cancer that we developed, CAR-T cells targeting the tumor-associated antigen ROR1 were uniformly Tcf1+ prior to infusion but rapidly downregulated Tcf1 in vivo and became terminally exhausted, similar to observations in patients, resulting in faster attrition and no enhancement in response to PD-L1 blockade. We hypothesized that overexpression of AP-1 family transcription factors, which can regulate T cell exhaustion, could enable CAR-Ts to maintain this critical PD-1+Tcf1+ subset within tumors independently of APCs and sensitize them to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Overexpression of the AP-1 TF c-Jun, but not BATF, improved preservation of PD-1+Tcf1+ CAR-T cells within tumors in a cell-intrinsic manner that correlated with increased persistence deeper within tumors. Notably, c-Jun overexpression alone was insufficient to prevent CAR-T exhaustion in the lung TME, in contrast to prior work in xenograft models, with progressive CAR-T dysfunction correlated with PD-1-dependent downregulation of c-Jun. However, c-Jun overexpression dramatically sensitized CAR-Ts to PD-L1 blockade, which restored c-Jun levels in CAR-Ts, drove log-fold expansion of CAR-Ts within tumors, and induced nearly complete eradication of ROR1+ tumor in highly aggressive models of lung cancer. Altogether, our data show that combination with PD-L1 blockade is necessary to unleash the full potential of c-Jun-overexpressing CAR-T cells in aggressive solid tumors like lung cancer and suggest that strategies to enhance formation of intratumoral PD-1+Tcf1+ reservoirs can overcome CAR-T resistance to PD-1 blockade."
"Neurons display remarkable diversity in their anatomical, molecular, and physiological properties. Although observed stereotypy in subsets of neurons is a pillar of neuroscience, clustering in high-dimensional feature spaces, such as those defined by single-cell RNA-seq data, is often inconclusive, with cells seemingly occupying continuous, rather than discrete, regions. In the retina, a layered structure, neurons of the same discrete type avoid spatial proximity with each other. While this principle, which is independent of clustering in feature space, has been a gold standard for retinal cell types, its applicability to the cortex has been only sparsely explored. Here, we provide evidence for such a mosaic hypothesis by developing a statistical point process analysis framework for spatial transcriptomic data. We demonstrate spatial avoidance across many excitatory and inhibitory neuronal types. Spatial avoidance disappears when cell types are merged, potentially offering a gold standard metric for evaluating the purity of putative cell types.

Significance statementWhile morphologically or molecularly-defined cell types and their taxonomy are a pillar of modern neuroscience, the extent to which their discrete treatment reflects biology is far from settled. A functional hypothesis concerning cortical neuronal cell types with roots in retina research suggests an anatomical test for the existence and identification of pure, discrete cell types. We describe evidence for this decades-old hypothesis in the mouse neocortex and detail the associated computational methodology based on spatial point processes."
"How do we make good decisions in uncertain environments? In psychology and neuroscience, the classic view is that we calculate the value of each option, compare them, and choose the most rewarding modulo exploratory noise. An ethologist, conversely, would argue that we commit to one option until its value drops below a threshold and then explore alternatives. Because the fields use incompatible methods, it remains unclear which view better describes human decision-making. Here, we found that humans use compare-to-threshold computations in classic compare-alternative tasks. Because compare-alternative computations are central to the reinforcement-learning (RL) models typically used in the cognitive and brain sciences, we developed a novel compare-to-threshold model (""foraging""). Compared to previous RL models, the foraging model better fit participant behavior, better predicted the tendency to repeat choices, and predicted held-out participants that were almost impossible under comparealternative models. These results suggest that humans use compare-to-threshold computations in sequential decision-making."
"During angiogenesis, endothelial cells expand the vasculature by migrating from existing blood vessels, proliferating and collectively organizing into new capillaries. In vitro and in vivo experimentation is instrumental for identifying the molecular players and cell behaviour that regulate angiogenesis. Alongside experimental work, computational and mathematical models of endothelial cell network formation have helped to analyse if the current molecular and cellular understanding of endothelial cell behaviour is sufficient to explain the formation of endothelial cell networks. As input, the models take (a subset of) the current knowledge or hypotheses of single cell behaviour and capture it into a dynamical, mathematical description. As output, they predict the multicellular behaviour following from the actions of many individual cells, i.e., formation of a vascular-like network. Paradoxically, computational modelling based on different assumptions, i.e., completely different, sometimes non-intersecting sets of observed single cell behaviour, can reproduce the same angiogenesis-like multicellular behaviour, making it practically impossible to decide which, if any, of these models is correct. Here we present dynamical analyses of time-lapses of in vitro endothelial cell network formation experiments and compare these with dynamic analyses of three mathematical models: (1) the cell elongation model; (2) the contact-inhibited chemotaxis model; and (3) the mechanical cell-cell communication model. We extract a variety of dynamical characteristics of endothelial cell network formation using a custom time-lapse video analysis pipeline in ImageJ. We compare the dynamical network characteristics of the in vitro experiments to those of the cellular networks produced by the computational models. We test the response of the in silico dynamical cell network characteristics to changes in cell density and make related changes in the in vitro experiments. Of the three computational models that we have considered, the cell elongation model best captures the remodelling phase of in vitro endothelial cell network formation. Furthermore, in the in vitro model, the final size and number of lacunae in the network are independent of the initial cell density. This observation is also reproduced in the cell elongation model, but not in the other two models that we have considered. Altogether, we present an approach to model validation based on comparisons of time-resolved data and variations of model conditions.

Author SummaryUnderstanding how blood vessels grow and organise into well-structured networks is crucial for many clinical applications, from wound healing to cancer treatment. The growth of blood vessels, known as angiogenesis, involves endothelial cells migrating, proliferating, and forming new vascular structures. Angiogenesis is studied through biological experiments, but mathematical models are also used to test whether our understanding of cell behaviour is sufficient to explain cell network formation. Models assuming chemotaxis, elongated cell shape, contact inhibition or mechanical cell-cell communication often produce similar results despite the large differences in the underlying assumptions, making it difficult to determine which model is most accurate. In this study, we analysed time-lapse videos of endothelial cell network formation and compared these with three computational models: (1) the cell elongation model, (2) the contact-inhibited chemotaxis model, and (3) the mechanical cell-cell communication model. By examining the dynamics of network formation and testing how they change with cell density, we found that the cell elongation model best captures key aspects of the real-life cell network remodelling process. This approach highlights the importance of time-resolved data in evaluating computational models and provides a framework for refining our understanding of angiogenesis."
"The incredibly narrow protein fold bottleneck, which separates the billions of unique proteins on one side to deliver diverse biological functions on the other, arises from folds that tolerate mutations during evolution. One such fold, called the {beta}-trefoil, is present in functionally diverse proteins including cytokines involved in the immune system such as interleukin-1. The unrecognizable sequence-level diversity, even among paralogs of interleukin-1 within the same chromosomal locus, suggests the resilience of this fold to mutational onslaught. Furthermore, {beta}-trefoil domain containing-proteins are known to coexist with other domains to achieve functional diversity. In this study, we challenge the reach and limitations of function prediction using fold-fold comparison using {beta}-trefoil fold as an example. We identified proteins containing {beta}-trefoil fold belonging to thirty-two distinct functional class based on diverse domain architecture and or functional annotation by mining both the PDB and AlphaFold databases using fold-fold comparison. Among the proteins with novel domain architecture we find {beta}-trefoil along with chitinase, lipase, {beta}-glucosidase, protein kinase, peptidoglycan-binding + peptidase matrixin, glycosyl hydrolases family 3 + PA14 + fibronectin type-III, alpha galactosidase A, PhoD-like phosphatase, insecticidal crystal toxin, trypsin, alginate lyase and two novel structurally uncharacterized domains. We demonstrate that fold-fold comparison can extend function prediction beyond the reach of sequence-based approach and provides an opportunity to discover novel domain architecture associated with known folds. However, since extending fold similarity to functional similarity may be challenged by convergent fold evolution, we explore if {beta}-trefoil may be a convergent evolution and share our hypothesis."
"Adipose tissue is rapidly expanding early in life. Identifying the queues facilitating this process will advance our understanding of metabolically healthy obesity. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed compositional differences between pre-wean and adult murine subcutaneous adipose tissue. We identify a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (Dpp4) positive precursor population in pre-wean mice residing at the reticular interstitium of subcutaneous adipose tissue expressing insulin growth factor 2 (Igf2). We show that IGF2 drives proliferation rather than differentiation in these cells. Moreover, loss of Igf2 in Dpp4+ progenitor cells promotes adipogenesis. We show that expression of Igf2 at a limited timeframe during development promotes preadipocyte expansion."
"The identification of RNA motifs plays a crucial role in understanding biological functions, predicting RNA 3D structures, and designing RNA-based therapeutics. One of the efficient strategies approaches this task by analyzing secondary structure graphs annotated with non-canonical base interactions, effectively reframing the problem as a two-dimensional graph-theoretic challenge. However, both the graph isomorphism problem and the maximum common subgraph problem in this domain are classified as NP-complete. Classical computing architectures struggle to address these problems efficiently due to their substantial computational resource demands. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm specifically designed for processing RNA secondary structure graphs. By encoding the adjacency matrix into a quantum circuit and incorporating base interaction families as edge weights, our approach achieves a resource efficiency of [O](log2 N) in terms of qubits. Numerical simulations demonstrate the algorithms capability to identify 15 distinct motifs across three structural categories: hairpin loops, internal loops, and three-way junction loops. Furthermore, the method successfully detects the common motif between two complete RNA chains. Finally, 29 high conserved RNA motifs were identified in four cell lines of a key lung cancer biomarker gene (MIF), and their potential roles as drug targets were explored. This work presents a highly promising quantum computing framework for addressing the RNA motif identification problem."
"Understanding pleiotropic architectures of phenotypes is instrumental for identifying the functional basis of adaptive genetic variation in the wild. Life-history variation may have a morphological basis that mediates resource acquisition allocation pathways, but identifying the underlying genetic basis of such traits is challenging. Using Atlantic salmon juveniles reared in common garden conditions, we test if two life-history associated loci in Atlantic salmon, six6 and vgll3, are also associated with functional morphological traits. These loci had previously shown to exhibit strong signals of adaptation and are highly correlated with sea age at maturity. We show that genetic variation at the vgll3 locus is linked to variation in morphological traits that underlie swimming performance, along a trade-off axis between efficient cruising and maneuvering, while the genetic variation at the six6 locus was linked to variation in body-head proportions suggesting the potential functional importance of these traits for resource acquisition efficiency. However, the direction of changes in morphological traits associated with late-vs. early-maturing alleles was not always consistent with the expected direction of an effect to maturation timing. Our results reveal a complex morphological landscape associated with the genetic variation in these loci, possibly as a result of pleiotropy or linkage across these genomic regions."
"Neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinsons disease (PD) pose significant health challenges. A major hallmark is the aggregation of -synuclein into toxic oligomers (SO) and fibrils. While many efforts focus on slowing disease progression, the molecular origins and mechanisms of SO toxicity remain poorly understood, particularly its proposed link to membrane disruption. To address this, we have developed a single-vesicle analysis platform for direct and real-time measurements of SO and membrane interaction. This allows us to show real-time translocation of dyes through SO pores with single-particle resolution and single-channel electrical recordings for analyzing pore formation in planar lipid bilayers. Across methods, our data reveal evidence for a three-stage model for SO and membrane interactions with initial membrane recruitment followed by partial pore insertion and subsequent full pore formation. Strikingly, while SO recruitment was found to favor curved membranes, pore formation occurred more efficiently in less curved membranes, hence recruitment is divorced from a membrane charge-promoted reorientation and pore integration. Single SO pore formations are undergoing multiple translocation steps hence pore formation is highly dynamic cycling back and forth from partial insertion to full pore formation. The dynamic nature of pore formation can be modulated by lipid charge, lipid headgroup class, and ligand binding. Our findings suggest that increased dynamic pore formation could implies increased membrane toxicity. Evidence for the three-stage model is important for future targeting strategies for blocking SO mitigated PD-related cellular dysfunction and we envision the single-vesicle assay enables screening for ligands modulating the pore formation."
"Navigating everyday environments requires that the brain perform information processing at multiple different timescales. For example, while watching a movie we use sensory information from every video frame to construct the current movie scene, which itself is continuously integrated into the narrative arc of the film. This critical function is supported by sensory inputs propagating from dynamic sensory cortices to association cortices, where neural activity remains more stable over time. The hierarchical organization of cortex is therefore reflected in a gradient of neural timescales. While this propagation of inputs up the cortical hierarchy is facilitated by both rhythmic (oscillatory) and non-rhythmic (aperiodic) neural activity, traditional measures of oscillations are often confounded by the influence of aperiodic signals. The reverse is also true: traditional measures of aperiodic neural timescales are influenced by oscillations. This makes it difficult to distinguish between oscillatory and timescale effects in cognition. Here, we analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) data from participants performing a cognitive control task that manipulated the amount of task-relevant contextual information, called task abstraction. Critically, we separated aperiodic neural timescales from the confounding influence of oscillatory power. We hypothesized that neural timescales would increase during the task, and more so in high-abstraction conditions. We found that task abstraction dilated the aperiodic neural timescale, as estimated from the autocorrelation function, over prefrontal cortical regions. Our findings suggests that neural timescales are a dynamic feature of the cerebral cortex that change to meet task demands.

Significance StatementThough often thought of as indexing anatomical brain structure, neural timescales have recently come under the spotlight for their variability across different task conditions. Here, we investigated whether neural timescales dynamically change during cognitive tasks that require a greater level of contextual control. Previous work quantified neural timescales using the autocorrelation function, but this approach conflates oscillatory and aperiodic contributions to the timescale. Thus, we decomposed the neural timescale into oscillatory and aperiodic components, and found that aperiodic-derived timescale measures dynamically change with contextual control. Oscillatory power also exhibits change in response to task demands, reaffirming previous findings. These results together suggest that both established oscillatory and novel aperiodic measures of neural timescales can dynamically change to meet task demands."
"The Arf (and Arf-like) GTPases, unlike all other Ras family GTPase members, exhibit a repressed conformation in the inactive, GDP-bound form. The N-terminal helix of Arf GTPases, which is missing in the other Ras family members, caps the switch region, confining it to this repressed state. Nucleotide exchange and activation involve a massive conformational change made possible by the dissociation of the N-terminal helix from the core of the protein. Spontaneous switching in Arfs is enhanced upon deletion of this helix. While the structural and functional role of the N-terminal helix in Arf proteins is well-known, the energetic basis for its effects have not been established. Here we mapped the local stability of the Arf1{Delta}17 variant, deleted for the N-terminal helix, using high pressure biophysical approaches and compared it to that of full-length Arf1. Deletion of the N-terminal helix decreased Arf1 stability across the entire structure. Thus, rather than imposing a specific structural pathway for repression, the N-terminal helix exercises global control of Arf1 stability to repress switching.

Statement of SignificanceEnergetic mapping of the N-terminal deletion mutant of Arf1 using high pressure biophysical approaches reveals that this helix maintains the protein in the repressed state unique to Arf and Arf-like GTPases via overall stabilization of the native state rather than unique allosteric communication with the switch region."
"Organisms must adapt to changing environments, and behavioural flexibility plays an important role in adaptation within an individuals lifetime. Stress resilience influences flexibility, as short-term stress can enhance attention and memory, while prolonged stress may impair cognitive function. Nutritional state also plays a role, with overweight individuals often suffering greater consequences of chronic stress. The allostatic load model predicts that these individuals, under prolonged stress, remain in a chronically activated state, potentially reducing flexibility.

Using a social cichlid, we manipulated body condition and exposed individuals to occasional or frequent predator presentations. We then assessed stress responses and behavioural flexibility via a reversal learning test. Contrary to predictions, fish in a high nutritional state exposed to frequent predators recovered rapidly from stress and exhibited enhanced flexibility. Our results provide direct evidence that nutritional state interacts with behavioural flexibility, revealing the costs of coping with repeated stressors.

We highlight a link between brief stress responses, characterized by rapid cortisol recovery, and improved flexibility. This association only emerged in well-nourished individuals facing frequent stressors, suggesting energy reserves buffer the costs of repeated stress. Thus, resilience benefits behavioural flexibility, but it is also energetically costly, as a reduced diet hindered adaptation to environmental change."
"Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is a growing threat to public health due to its increasing prevalence and limited treatment options. The urgent need for alternative therapeutics necessitates novel strategies such as drug repurposing to identify effective antimicrobial agents. In this study, we screened a library of 1,135 antibacterial compounds to identify candidates with activity against VRE. A total of 58 active compounds were identified, with ridinilazole and CRS3123 emerging as the most promising hits. Both compounds exhibited potent antibacterial activity in the nanomolar range against multiple Enterococcus species, including vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-sensitive E. faecium, E. faecalis, E. hirae and E. durans. CRS3123 demonstrated exceptional potency, exhibiting MIC values of <0.007 g/mL against most strains. Ridinilazole exhibited an MIC spectrum of <0.007 to 1 g/mL across all strains, with E. faecium being the most sensitive (MIC: <0.007-0.25 g/mL) and E. faecalis displaying a higher MIC range (0.5-1 g/mL). Time-kill assays indicated that both compounds exhibited bacteriostatic activity comparable to linezolid. Additionally, ridinilazole and CRS3123 displayed low cytotoxicity in Vero cells and no hemolytic activity, suggesting a favorable safety profile. In vivo studies using the C. elegans infection model further confirmed their efficacy, with ridinilazole achieving a 60% reduction in VRE burden, CRS3123 resulting in a 25% reduction, and linezolid demonstrating a 55% reduction. These findings highlight ridinilazole and CRS3123 as promising candidates for further development for managing VRE infections."
"Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is widely used for quantitative protein profiling and has become a powerful tool for studying protein interactions. However, most current research focuses on single-species proteomics to study protein interactions. Protein interactions within more complex microbiomes, composed of 100s of bacterial species, remain largely unexplored. The human gut microbiome, closely linked to human health and disease, has become a key area of study using metaproteomics. Yet, due to the complexity of the microbiome, the interactions between gut microbes and their host remain largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed peptide abundance correlations within a metaproteomics dataset derived from in vitro cultured human gut microbiomes subjected to various drug treatments. Our analysis revealed that peptides from the same protein or taxon exhibited correlated abundance changes. By using t-SNE for visualization, we generated a peptide correlation map in which peptides from the same taxon formed distinct clusters. Furthermore, peptide abundance correlations enabled genome-level taxonomic assignments for a greater number of peptides. In single-species subsets of the dataset, peptide correlation networks constructed using taxon-based normalized peptide abundance (TNPA) linked peptides from functionally related proteins. These networks also provided insights into the potential functions of previously uncharacterized proteins. Altogether, our study demonstrates that analyzing peptide abundance correlations enhances both taxonomic and functional analyses in human gut metaproteomics research."
"MotivationLarge-scale drug sensitivity screens have enabled training drug response prediction models based on cancer cell line omics profiles to facilitate personalized medicine. While model performances reported in the literature appear promising, no successful translation to the clinic has been reported.

ResultsWe identify six primary obstacles to this: non-reproducible models, data leakage leading to poor generalization, pseudoreplication, biased evaluation metrics, missing ablation studies, and inconsistent viability data reducing comparability across models. Together, these issues lead to overly optimistic performance estimates of state-of-the-art models and make it challenging to track progress in the field.

To address this, we present DrEval, a pipeline for unbiased and biologically meaningful evaluation of cancer drug response models. It includes baseline and literature models with consistent hyperparameter tuning, statistically sound evaluations, and cross-study benchmarks. DrEval enables ablation studies and publication-ready visualizations. It allows researchers to focus on model development without implementing their own evaluation protocol.

We find that deep learning models barely outperform a naive model predicting the mean drug and cell line effects, while no complex model significantly outperforms properly tuned tree-based ensemble baselines in relevant settings. We advocate making our pipeline a standard benchmark for cancer drug response prediction, ensuring a clinically relevant and robust assessment.

Availability and implementationDrEval consists of a Python package, available on PyPI (drevalpy) and GitHub (github.com/daisybio/drevalpy), and an accompanying nf-core pipeline (github.com/nf-core/drugresponseeval). All data is available on Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.12633909), preprocessing scripts on github.com/daisybio/preprocess_drp_data."
"While developmental origins are suspected for many adult diseases, the lifespan effects of developmental perturbations have not been well studied. Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (SVD) is a leading cause of stroke and dementia and yet is often an incidental finding in aged patients due to the inaccessibility of brain vasculature to imaging of small vessels. In humans, reduced FOXF2 is associated with an increased stroke risk and SVD. We use a zebrafish partial foxf2 loss of function to model its effect on small vessel biology through development and aging. In the zebrafish, foxf2 is expressed in brain vascular pericytes and promotes vascular stability. We find that the initial pool of pericytes in developing foxf2a mutants is strongly reduced without affecting the endothelial network. The few brain pericytes present in mutants have strikingly longer processes and enlarged soma. foxf2a mutant pericytes can partially repopulate the brain after genetic ablation suggesting some recovery is possible. Nonetheless, adult foxf2a mutant brains show regional heterogeneity, with areas of normal pericyte coverage of vessels, but others with severe pericyte depletion. Both pericyte and endothelial morphology is strongly affected in adults. Taken together, foxf2a mutants fail to generate a sufficient initial population of pericytes and the few pericytes remaining have abnormal cell morphology. Over the lifespan foxf2a loss leads to severely abnormal cerebrovasculature. Our work opens new understanding of the progression of genetic forms of human Cerebral Small Vessel Disease."
"The main structural components of mucus produced in the lung are mucin 5B (MUC5B) and mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) where a relatively higher expression of MUC5B is typical in health. In the lungs of individuals with asthma, there is a shift from MUC5B to MUC5AC as the predominantly secreted mucin which has been shown to impair mucociliary clearance (MCC) and increase mucus plug formation in the airways. Given its role in asthmatic lung disease, MUC5AC represents a potential therapeutic target where a gene delivery approach could be leveraged to modulate its expression. For these purposes, we explored adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6), as a lung-tropic viral gene vector to target airway epithelial cells and reduce MUC5AC expression via siRNA delivery. We confirmed that AAV6 was able to transduce epithelial cells in the airways of healthy mice with high transgene expression in mucus-secreting goblet cells. Using multiple particle tracking analysis, we observed that AAV6 was capable of penetrating both normal and MUC5AC-enriched mucus barriers. Successful transduction with AAV6 was also achieved in IL-13 stimulated human airway epithelial (HAE) cells differentiated at air-liquid interface (ALI). AAV6 expressing MUC5AC-targeting siRNA was evaluated as a prophylactic treatment in HAE cell cultures before IL-13 challenge. IL-13 stimulated HAE cultures treated with AAV6-MUC5AC siRNA had significantly reduced MUC5AC mRNA and protein expression compared to untreated controls. Mucociliary transport in IL-13 stimulated HAE cultures was also maintained and comparable to healthy controls following AAV6-MUC5AC siRNA treatment. Together, these findings support that AAV6 may be used as an inhaled gene therapy to suppress MUC5AC overexpression and restore normal airway clearance function in asthma."
"Accurate modeling of T cell receptor (TCR)-peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) interactions is critical for understanding immune recognition. In this study, we present advances in structural modeling of TCR-pMHC class I complexes focusing on improving docking quality scoring and structural model selection using graph neural networks (GNN). We find that AlphaFold-Multimers confidence score in certain cases correlates poorly with DockQ quality scores, leading to overestimation of model accuracy. Our proposed GNN solution achieves a 25% increase in Spearmans correlation between predicted quality and DockQ (from 0.681 to 0.855) and improves docking candidate ranking. Additionally, the GNN completely avoids selection of failed structures. Additionally, we assess the ability of our models to distinguish binding from non-binding TCR-pMHC interactions based on their predicted quality. Here, we demonstrate that our proposed model, particularly for high-quality structural models, is capable of discriminating between binding and non-binding complexes in a zero-shot setting. However, our findings also underlined that the structural pipeline struggled to generate sufficiently accurate TCR-pMHC models for reliable binding classification, highlighting the need for further improvements in modeling accuracy."
"We developed a generative World Model in the context of biomolecular simulations for proteins. An agent was trained by evolution strategy in a latent spatio-temporal representation of the structural transitions, to learn a policy to drive protein folding simulations via dihedral rotations ({Phi}, {Psi}). Latent configurations were decoded back into atomistic structures using atomistic force fields, allowing for the calculation of structural properties and energetic terms. We show how the model can be regularized by adding Ramachandran-based rewards during the training of the controller. Results have been validated against equilibrium MD data. Markov State Modeling could be applied to reconstruct the dynamics of the system and reconstruct the unbiased folding landscape. The method proposed here facilitates the study of the conformational changes and folding pathways of proteins by generative AI, and can have application in structure-based drug discovery."
"Neuroinflammation, particularly astrocyte reactivity, is increasingly linked to schizophrenia (SCZ). Yet, the crosstalk between astrocytes and microglia in SCZ, especially under pro-inflammatory conditions, remains unclear. Here, we employed human induced-pluripotent stem cells to compare how astrocytes from five age-matched individuals with SCZ and five neurotypical controls, upon stimulation with TNF-, affected microglial biology. TNF-[a] stimulation of SCZ astrocytes, relative to their control counterparts, triggered increased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and CX3CL1. Interestingly, transcriptomic and gene set enrichment analyses revealed that reactive SCZ astrocytes promoted the downregulation of biological processes associated with immune cell proliferation and activation, phagocytosis and cell migration in induced microglial-like cells (iMGs). Under such conditions, iMGs assumed a dystrophic/senescent-like phenotype, which was associated with accelerated transcriptional aging. Functional validations showed that TNF-[a]-stimulated SCZ astrocytes promoted reduced synaptoneurosomes phagocytosis by iMGs. Interestingly, only reactive control astrocytes were capable to induce significant microglial migration in a CX3CR1-dependent manner, despite the greater CX3CL1 secretion by reactive SCZ astrocytes compared to their stimulated control counterparts. This was likely due to SCZ astrocytes triggered reduction in CX3CR1 plasma membrane levels in iMGs. Altogether, these findings suggest that astrocytes contribute to SCZ pathology by altering normal microglial function and inducing a dystrophic phenotype.

"BackgroundHypertension prevalence increases with age, reaching over 70% of people over age 65. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study interrogates a new signaling pathway in vascular smooth muscle of aged mice driven by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, RSK2, and its role in increasing peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure (BP).

MethodsBasal BP measurements were taken at 26-29 month (812-892 day) old mice with global deletion of RSK2 (Rsk2-/-) prior to and following treatment with L-NAME. Cardiac function, vessel stiffness, myogenic responses, Ca2+events, contractility, immuno-staining, histology studies and western blotting were performed.

ResultsResting BP and myogenic vasoconstriction were normal in aged global Rsk2-/- mice and elevated in wild type (WT) littermates. L-NAME treatment increased BP in aged Rsk2+/+ but not aged Rsk2-/-. Vessel stiffness and glycation collagen crosslinking increased in both aged Rsk2+/+ and Rsk2-/- compared to young vessels with no remodeling or increase in collagen content, even though BP in aged Rsk2-/- arterioles was normal. Increased vessel stiffness was dissociated from increased BP. Ca2+ transients increased and sensitivity to NO-induced relaxation decreased in aged Rsk2+/+ compared to young WT arterioles. IEL structures, eNOS and Hb distribution at myoendothelial junctions were disturbed impairing vasorelaxation in aged Rsk2+/+ but not aged Rsk2-/- arterioles.

ConclusionsRSK2 plays a significant role in hypertension associated with aging by downregulating prorelaxant signaling and promoting procontractile events in the vasculature, offering potential new therapeutic targets."
"Agent-based models of malaria transmission are useful tools for understanding disease dynamics and planning interventions, but they can be computationally intensive to calibrate. We present a multitask deep learning approach for emulating and calibrating a complex agent-based model of malaria transmission. Our neural network emulator was trained on a large suite of simulations from the EMOD malaria model, an agent-based model of malaria transmission dynamics, capturing relationships between immunological parameters and epidemiological outcomes such as age-stratified incidence and prevalence across eight sub-Saharan African study sites. We then use the trained emulator in conjunction with parameter estimation techniques to calibrate the underlying model to reference data. Taken together, this analysis shows the potential of machine learning-guided emulator design for complex scientific processes and their comparison to field data.

Author summaryMathematical models can help understand and design interventions for infectious diseases such as malaria, but they can be complex and time-consuming to work with. In this study, we developed a machine learning approach to create a fast and accurate emulator for a detailed malaria transmission model. Our emulator can quickly predict various disease outcomes based on different immune system parameters. We trained it using a large set of simulations created using the EMOD malaria model and tested it against real-world data from multiple African countries. The emulator not only matches the original models predictions closely, but can also be used to efficiently find the best parameter values to match field observations. We hope that this work can serve as a demonstration of machine learning tools to link complex models of disease transmission to field data."
"Internalizing problems (e.g., anxiety and depression) are associated with a wide range of adverse outcomes. While some predictors of internalizing problems are known (e.g., their frequent co-occurrence with neurodevelopmental (ND) conditions), the biological markers of internalizing problems are not well understood. Here, we used deep learning, a powerful tool for identifying complex and multi-dimensional brain-behaviour relationships, to predict cross-sectional and worsening longitudinal trajectories of internalizing problems. Data were extracted from four large-scale datasets: the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, the Healthy Brain Network, the Human Connectome Project Development study, and the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental network. We developed deep learning models that used measures of brain structure (thickness, surface area, and volume) to (a) predict clinically significant internalizing problems cross-sectionally (N=14,523); and (b) predict subsequent worsening trajectories (using the reliable change index) of internalizing problems (N=10,540) longitudinally. A stratified cross-validation scheme was used to tune, train, and test the models, which were evaluated using the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC). The cross-sectional model performed well across the sample, reaching an AUC of 0.80[95% CI: 0.71,0.88]. For the longitudinal model, while performance was sub-optimal for predicting worsening trajectories in a sample of the general population (AUC=0.66[0.65,0.67]), good performance was achieved in a small, external test set of primarily ND conditions (AUC=0.80[0.78,0.81]), as well as across all ND conditions (AUC=0.73[0.70,0.76]). Deep learning with features of brain structure is a promising avenue for biomarkers of internalizing problems, particularly for individuals who have a higher likelihood of experiencing difficulties."
"Grapevine downy mildew, caused by the oomycete Plasmopara viticola, is one of the most devastating diseases of grapevine worldwide. Primary inoculum is increasingly thought to play a decisive role in downy mildew epidemics, but we still know very little about its abundance in vineyard soil. We present a direct and sensitive method for the quantification of P. viticola oospores (i.e. primary inoculum) in vineyard soil, based on digital droplet PCR and an estimation of the number of copies of the ITS sequence used for amplification in the genome of P. viticola. We used this method to describe the spatial distribution of P. viticola oospores in a vineyard. We found oospores in all samples except one, and concentration ranged from 0 to 1858 oospores per gram of soil (303 {+/-} 308 on average). The distribution of oospores at field scale was not random but characterized by 25 m-diameter patches of concentrically increasing oospore concentration. Oospores accumulated 5 times more below the vine stocks than in the inter-row. We conducted a leaf disc bioassay to assess soil infectious potential on a subset of our samples. Soil infectious potential significantly increased with oospore concentration, suggesting that DNA-based methods can have an epidemiological significance. Quantitative data on P. viticola oospores could be useful to design sampling strategy for future research or to improve epidemic risk models.

ImportanceGrapevine downy mildew is an airborne disease caused by the oomycete Plasmopara viticola affecting leaves and bunches and leading to important economic losses for viticulturists. Its control mainly relies on the use of fungicides during the growing season. Due to their harmful effects on human health and biodiversity, European and national policies encourage pesticide use reduction either by developing alternative control strategies or by optimizing use efficiency. Recently, evidences have accumulated that primary inoculum (i.e. oospores in the soil) importantly contributes to disease progress. The significance of our work is in presenting a direct and sensitive method for assessing soil oospore concentration, as well as quantitative and spatially-explicit data on downy mildew primary inoculum, opening the way to new research, the evaluation of new disease control strategies based on primary inoculum management and the improvement of epidemic risk models, that will in fine contribute to lower fungicide use in viticulture."
"BackgroundTransposable elements (TEs) play a crucial role in genome evolution, influencing gene regulation, diversity, and genome architecture. Rust fungi of the order Pucciniales (Subphylum Pucciniomycotina) are the largest group of obligate biotrophic plant pathogens and harbor some of the largest and most TE-rich genomes - up to 1.2Gb - compared to other fungi. This global genomic expansion contrasts with the smaller genomes and minimal mobilome found in other Pucciniomycotina species. Despite the availability of high-quality genome assemblies, our understanding of TE dynamics in Pucciniales remains limited due to inconsistent and incomplete TE annotations.

ResultsWe analyzed the mobilomes of 12 Pucciniomycotina species, producing a manually curated TE library for each genome. In Pucciniales, TEs occupy 47-92% of the genome, whereas 2-36% of TEs are detected in other Pucciniomycotina genomes. The comparison of gene and TE repertoires indicates that TEs, particularly LTR-retrotransposons and TIR-DNA transposons, are the primary contributors to the genome expansion of the Pucciniales. We reconstructed the proliferation histories of TEs in the Pucciniales, combining sequence similarity, clustering, and molecular clock approaches. We highlight recent and ancient TE invasions with some LTR-Gypsy elements predating the divergence of Pucciniomycotina ([~]176 Mya), while most TE accumulation in Pucciniales occurred within the last 50 Mya. However, the TE invasions in the Pucciniales genomes do not seem to result from specific deficiencies in known TE-control mechanisms.

ConclusionOur findings uncover extensive TE proliferation in Pucciniales, predominantly driven by LTR-Gypsy expansions. The retention of ancestral TEs and the consistently TE-rich genomes observed in Pucciniales highlight TE proliferation as an ancestral genomic feature in rust fungi."
"Genetic effects on academic achievement are likely to capture environmental, developmental, and psychological processes. How these processes contribute to translating genetic dispositions into observed academic achievement remains critically under-investigated. Here, we examined the role of non-cognitive skills--e.g., motivation, attitudes and self-regulation--in mediating education-associated genetic effects on academic achievement across development. Data were collected from 5,016 children enrolled in the Twins Early Development Study at ages 7, 9, 12, and 16, as well as their parents and teachers. We found that non-cognitive skills mediated polygenic score effects on academic achievement across development, and longitudinally, accounting for up to 64% of the total effects. Within-family analyses highlighted the contribution of non-cognitive skills beyond genetic, environmental and demographic factors that are shared between siblings, accounting for up to 83% of the total mediation effect, likely reflecting evocative/active gene-environment correlation. Our results underscore the role of non-cognitive skills in academic development in how children evoke and select experiences that align with their genetic propensity."
"Over recent decades, studies of cell-to-cell heterogeneity have shown that meaningful variation in stress responses is an evolved trait, exemplified by bet hedging. Here, we expand upon this work by using a high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics approach in S. cerevisiae to study cell-to-cell variation in stress responses. We measured individual transcriptional profiles of over ten thousand cells subjected to two types of stress: protein misfolding (an intrinsic stress) and nutrient deprivation (an extrinsic stress). Doing so, we saw substantial heterogeneity in responses to stress across and within different conditions. A previously defined canonical stress response is elevated in all stressful conditions, making it useful as a barometer of stress. However, it does not include the majority of the genes that are the most upregulated in response to any of the stresses we study, suggesting stress responses vary across environments. On the other hand, the genes that were downregulated with stress show a much stronger overlap across conditions. Even more striking is the cell-to-cell heterogeneity we observed in stress responses where some stressed cells exhibit neither a canonical stress response nor a transcriptional response that matches most other cells in the same vessel. Further investigation of these cell-to-cell differences revealed a misconception of population-averaged data: While transposable elements (TEs) and chaperones both appear positively correlated with stress at the population level, single-cell analysis revealed they are actually anticorrelated. In other words, some stressed cells upregulate TEs, while others upregulate chaperones. One possible mechanism for this involves chaperones, such as Hsp90, which are thought to help to silence TEs but are unable to do so effectively when these chaperones become overwhelmed during stress. In sum, we have used a powerful single-cell transcriptomics approach to quantify stress-response heterogeneity and to shed light on the mechanisms underlying cell-to-cell variation in stress responses, both of which are crucial for understanding cell evolution and disease."
"In all vertebrates studied to date, a rise(s) in intracellular calcium is indispensable for successful fertilization and further embryonic development. Recent studies demonstrated that zinc is ejected to the extracellular milieu, the  zinc spark, and follows the first few calcium rises of fertilization. However, the role of the zinc sparks in fertilization and development, and the supporting influx mechanism(s) are unknown. In this study, we focused on zinc transporters Zip10/Slc39a10 which was expressed in mouse oocytes through follicular development, and investigated the oocyte-specific deficient mice for Zip10 (Zip10d/d: Zip10flox/flox Gdf9Cre/+). Zip10 mRNA or ZIP10 protein was expressed throughout folliculogenesis in the oocyte or plasma membrane, respectively. The number of ovulated oocytes was examined in Zip10d/d mice, and no change from the number of oocytes was observed. Zip10d/d oocytes decreased zinc level in the oocytes, but did not affect maturation and metaphase II spindles formation. Fertilization-induced calcium oscillations were present in Zip10d/d oocytes, but zinc sparks were not observed. Despite other events of egg activation proceeding normally in Zip10d/doocytes, embryo development into 4-cells and beyond was compromised. We show here for the first time that the zinc transporter ZIP10 contributes to zinc homeostasis in oocytes and embryos, highlighting the role of labile zinc ions in early development.

Submission informationThe zinc transporter, Slc39a10/Zip10, is required for the zinc sparks of fertilization in mice."
"The dynamic regulation of RNA metabolism plays a crucial part in cellular function, with emerging evidence suggesting an important role for RNA modifications in this process. This study explores the relationship between RNA splicing and the TET dioxygenase activity, shedding light on the role of hm5C (RNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine), and TET proteins, in RNA metabolism. Integrating data from mass spectrometry, AlphaFold structural modeling, microscopic analysis, and different functional assays including in vitro splicing, TET proteins were found to regulate splicing. We show that TET1, TET2, and TET3 interact with the splicing factors U2AF1 and U2AF2. Interestingly, TET dioxygenases localize in splicing speckles in mammalian and Drosophila cells. TET speckles association is RNA dependent, as it is TET interaction with splicing factors. Furthermore, in vitro splicing assays revealed that all three TET proteins promote splicing efficiency, and the oxidation of m5C to hm5C can restore splicing efficiency in vitro. The latter highlights the regulatory role of cytosine modifications in RNA metabolism. These findings provide insights into the complex interplay between RNA modifications and splicing, suggesting a multifaceted role for TET proteins in RNA metabolism beyond its canonical DNA demethylation function.

"High-temperature requirement protein A1 (HTRA1) is a secreted serine protease with diverse substrates, including extracellular matrix proteins, proteins involved in amyloid deposition, and growth factors. Accordingly, HTRA1 has been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including a leading cause of blindness in the elderly, age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In fact, genome wide association studies have identified that the 10q26 locus which contains HTRA1 confers the strongest genetic risk factor for AMD. A recent study has suggested that AMD-associated risk alleles in HTRA1 correlate with a significant age-related defect in HTRA1 synthesis in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) within the eye, possibly accounting for AMD susceptibility. Thus, we sought to identify small molecule enhancers of HTRA1 transcription and/or protein abundance using an unbiased high-throughput screening approach. To accomplish this goal, we used CRISPR/Sp.Cas9 engineering to introduce an 11 amino acid luminescent peptide tag (HiBiT) onto the C-terminus of HTRA1 in immortalized ARPE-19 cells. Editing was very efficient ([~]88%), verified by genomic DNA analysis, short interfering RNA (siRNA), and HiBiT blotting. Nineteen-hundred and twenty compounds from two libraries were screened. An azo compound with reported anti-amyloidogenic and cardioprotective activity, Chicago Sky Blue 6B (CSB), was identified as an enhancer of endogenous HTRA1 secretion (2.0 {+/-} 0.3 fold) and intracellular levels (1.7 {+/-} 0.2 fold). These results were counter-screened using HiBiT complement factor H (CFH) edited ARPE-19 cells, verified using HiBiT blotting, and were not due to HTRA1 transcriptional changes. Importantly, serine hydrolase activity-based protein profiling (SH-ABPP) demonstrated that CSB does not affect HTRA1s specific activity. However, interestingly, in follow-up studies, Congo Red, another azo compound structurally similar to CSB, also substantially increased intracellular HTRA1 levels (up to 3.6 {+/-} 0.3 fold) but was found to significantly impair HTRA1 enzymatic reactivity (0.45 {+/-} 0.07 fold). Computational modeling of potential azo dye interaction with HTRA1 suggests that CSB and Congo Red can bind to the non-catalytic face of the trimer interface but with different orientation tolerances and interaction energies. These studies identify select azo dyes as HTRA1 chemical probes which may serve as starting points for future HTRA1-centered small molecule therapeutics."
"New psychoactive substances (NPS) targeting cannabinoid receptor 1 pose a significant threat to society as recreational abusive drugs that have pronounced physiological side effects. These greater adverse effects compared to classical cannabinoids have been linked to the higher downstream {beta}-arrestin signaling. Thus, understanding the mechanism of differential signaling will reveal important structure-activity relationship essential for identifying and potentially regulating NPS molecules. In this study, we simulate the slow (un)binding process of NPS MDMB-Fubinaca and classical cannabinoid HU-210 from CB1 using multi-ensemble simulation to decipher the effects of ligand binding dynamics on downstream signaling. The transition-based reweighing method is used for the estimation of transition rates and underlying thermodynamics of (un)binding processes of ligands with nanomolar affinities. Our analyses reveal major interaction differences with transmembrane TM7 between NPS and classical cannabinoids. A variational autoencoder-based approach, neural relational inference (NRI), is applied to assess the allosteric effects on intracellular regions attributable to variations in binding pocket interactions. NRI analysis indicate a heightened level of allosteric control of NPxxY motif for NPS-bound receptors, which contributes to the higher probability of formation of a crucial triad interaction (Y7.53-Y5.58-T3.46) necessary for stronger {beta}-arrestin signaling. Hence, in this work, MD simulation, data-driven statistical methods, and deep learning point out the structural basis for the heightened physiological side effects associated with NPS, contributing to efforts aimed at mitigating their public health impact."
"Cohesion between sister chromatids ensures accurate alignment and segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Cohesion establishment requires modification of the SMC3 subunit of cohesin by the ESCO2 acetyltransferase. ESCO2 function relies on interactions between ESCO2 and the DNA replication machinery, but how and whether these interactions are regulated during cell cycle progression is not known. Here we have found that phosphorylation of ESCO2 at serine 75 by cyclin-dependent kinase strongly impacts both interaction of ESCO2 with the replication machinery and ESCO2s ability to ensure sister chromatid cohesion. This study provides mechanistic insight into how establishment of sister chromatid cohesion is entrained in S phase by cell cycle-dependent mechanisms."
"The T3SS injectisome is used by Gram-negative bacteria, including important pathogens, to manipulate eukaryotic target cells by injecting effector proteins. While in some bacterial species, T3SS-negative bacteria benefit from the activity of their T3SS-positive siblings, the T3SS model organism Yersinia enterocolitica was thought to uniformly express and assemble injectisomes. In this study, we found that Yersinia actively suppress T3SS expression, assembly and activity at higher cell densities, such as inside microcolonies. This effect is highly specific to the T3SS, reversible, and distinct from stationary phase adaptation. It is conferred by the main T3SS transcription factor VirF, which is downregulated at higher densities and whose in trans expression restores T3SS activity. Transcript analysis showed that this effect is mediated by increased levels of the regulatory RNAs CsrBC, which sequester the regulatory protein CsrA and destabilize the virF transcript. The concomitant downregulation of the VirF-dependent adhesin YadA led to a drastic reduction in bacterial cell adhesion. We propose that this active suppression of T3SS secretion and cell attachment at higher local bacterial densities promotes a switch during Yersinia infection from a T3SS-active colonization stage to a bacterial replication and dissemination phase."
"Cortical and striatal circuits play an important role in motor planning and execution, and encode movement-related information. While neural dynamics in these areas show substantial similarities, possibly reflecting shared information content, studies directly comparing the cortical and striatal encoding of locomotor preparation and performance have been lacking. Here we contrasted the neural coding properties of mouse primary motor and medial prefrontal cortex, as well as dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatum, prior to and during bouts of self-initiated walking. All four areas contained cells active during both the preparatory and performance periods of locomotion. However, the decoding of behaviorally relevant information using population-level activity revealed significant regional variations. Specifically, dorsomedial striatum more accurately encoded the preparatory period prior to walking, while primary motor cortex more accurately encoded rhythmic limb kinematics during walking. Together, this work provides evidence for a complementary neural coding scheme for locomotor preparation and performance in cortical and striatal circuits."
"Neuropeptides play a critical role in neurotransmission and organismal development. Members of phylum Cnidaria, with a diffused nervous system, are one of the earliest divergent animals and might provide insights into the fundamentals of the emergence of neuronal communications. The neuropeptide diversity in Hydra (a cnidarian model) has been extensively studied using various strategies, each with certain limitations. Here, we have developed an in silico pipeline which identified both reported peptides and many new potential candidates. A comparative analysis within Cnidaria suggests a rapid divergence of neuropeptides which might be involved in complex behaviors. We identified new Hydra neuropeptides that belong to the RFamide and PRGamide families and a novel class of peptides lacking amidation (LW-peptides). A detailed expression and functional analysis of a new LW-peptide indicates its role in the longitudinal contraction of Hydra polyps. This study provides compelling evidence for the existence of intricate peptidergic communication in early neuronal circuits. The extensive diversity of neuropeptides within this phylum underscores their rapid evolutionary adaptability. This current pipeline also proves to be simple and adaptable to perform neuropeptide identification in other multicellular organisms."
"The Rev Response Element (RRE) forms an oligomeric complex with the viral protein Rev to facilitate the nuclear export of intron-retaining viral RNAs during the late phase of HIV-1 infection. However, our structural understanding of this crucial virological process remains limited. In this study, we determined several crystal structures of an intact RRE stem-loop II in two distinct conformations, performed negative-staining electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, and revealed that this three-way junction RNA exhibits remarkable structural plasticity. Through in vitro Rev-binding and in vivo Rev-activity assays using various stem-loop II mutants designed to favor one of the conformers, we demonstrated that the structural plasticity of stem-loop II modulates Rev binding and oligomerization. Our findings illuminate emerging perspectives on RRE dynamics-based regulation of HIV-1 RNA nuclear export and provide a framework for developing anti-HIV drugs that target specific RRE conformations."
"Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit drug during pregnancy, with use steadily increasing in the United States as legalization and decriminalization expand to more states. Many pregnant individuals use cannabis to reduce adverse symptoms of pregnancy, considering it to be less harmful than other pharmaceuticals or alcohol. The primary psychoactive component of cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), acts on the endocannabinoid (eCB) system, yet whether it perturbs neural development of the fetus is poorly understood. Previously we have shown that androgen mediated eCB tone in the developing amygdala promotes microglial phagocytosis of newborn astrocytes which has enduring consequences on the neural circuits regulating sex differences in social behavior. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain and express both receptors of the eCB system, CB1R and CB2R, making them likely targets of modulation by THC. It is also plausible that exposure to THC at differing gestational timepoints can result in distinct outcomes, as is the case with alcohol exposure. To model human cannabis use during either late or early pregnancy, we exposed rodents to THC either directly during the early postnatal period via intraperitoneal (IP) injection or in utero during the prenatal period via dam IP injection respectively. Here we show that postnatal THC exposure results in sex specific changes in microglial phagocytosis during development as well as social behavior during the juvenile period. Interestingly prenatal exposure to THC resulted in inverse changes to phagocytosis and social behavior. These findings highlight the differential effects of THC exposure across gestation."
"The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to support cognitive flexibility by forming and maintaining generalized representations of abstract tasks. The formation of these representations as well as their relation to preexisting representations of contextual or spatial information is incompletely understood. In this study, we analyzed longitudinal 1-photon calcium recordings in mice performing an olfaction-guided spatial memory task over an eight-week period that included habituation, training, and sleep epochs. Our results reveal that, while a minority of neurons initially conveyed significant information about the behavior of the animal, the bulk of task-related activity only emerged after the animals reached proficient performance. Although goal arm information is robustly represented at both the single-cell and network levels both during learning and in task proficient mice, it undergoes significant remapping throughout the learning process. Additionally, we identified the establishment of recurring sequences during learning and their replay at reward locations, with no evidence of them existing during odor sampling phase, during sleep or before training. These findings suggest that the mPFC predominantly establishes generalized task representations de novo during learning, relying only minimally on preexisting spatial representations and that sub-second neural sequences in the mPFC are more likely involved in evaluating behavioral outcomes rather than planning future actions."
"Lens vesicle closure is a pivotal event in ocular morphogenesis, and its disruption underlies Peters anomaly, a leading congenital cause of corneal opacity. Here, we elucidate a mechanistic hierarchy in which mTOR-Wnt signaling orchestrates cytoskeletal tension to drive this process. Conditional ablation of mTOR in the lens ectoderm induces aberrant corneal-lenticular stalk formation and transdifferentiation of the ciliary margin into neural retina. mTOR inhibition suppresses Wnt3 expression, and Wnt3 displayed a similar lens stalk phenotype, positioning mTOR as an upstream regulator of Wnt ligand production. Complete ablation of lens-derived Wnt ligands via deletion of the Wnt transporter Wls exacerbates developmental defects, triggering anterior lens herniation and ciliary margin development failure. Disruption of {beta}-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling or dual deletion of Wnt co-receptors Lrp5/6 in lens ectoderm similarly prevents vesicle closure, recapitulating lens herniation. Strikingly, Rac1 deletion rescues corneal-lenticular stalk phenotypes in mTOR, Wls, and {beta}-catenin mutants, directly linking Wnt effectors to cytoskeletal remodeling. Our findings establish an mTOR-Wnt-Rac1 signaling axis as the core regulator of cytoskeletal tension required for lens vesicle closure."
"Malaria in South America remains a serious public health problem. Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) darlingi is the most important malaria vector across tropical Latin America. Vector-targeted disease control efforts require a thorough understanding of mosquito demographic and evolutionary patterns. We present and analyze whole genomes of 1094 A. darlingi (median depth 18x) from six South American countries. We observe deep geographic population structure, high genetic diversity including thirteen putative segregating inversions, and no evidence for cryptic sympatric taxa despite high interpopulation divergence. Strong signals of selection are plausibly driven by insecticides, especially on cytochrome P450 genes, one of which we validated experimentally. Our results will facilitate effective mosquito surveillance and control, while highlighting ongoing challenges that a diverse vector poses for malaria elimination in the western hemisphere."
"The R707W mutation in mitofusin 2, encoded by MFN2, causes a form of Multiple Symmetrical Lipomatosis (MFN2-MSL). This resembles sporadic, alcohol-associated MSL, combining loss of lower body adipose tissue with upper body adipose hyperplasia. Morbidity and sometimes mortality arise both from mechanical complications of head and neck adipose overgrowth, and metabolic complications. We reasoned that interventions that either mitigate the underlying cellular pathology, or that exacerbate it to induce selective death of hyperplastic adipose tissue may be beneficial. We thus assessed the effect of a metabolic or pharmacologic stressors or rapamycin in Mfn2R707W/R707W mice and or derived preadipocytes. 50mmol ethanol had little effect on WT or Mfn2R707W/R707W white preadipocytes, but increased mitochondrial content and blunted mitolysosome formation in Mfn2R707W/R707W brown preadipocytes. Daily consumption of 20% EtOH increased brown adipose tissue mass in female Mfn2R707W/R707W mice, and serum lactate in males. 200nM rapamycin - a candidate treatment - increased size and mitolysosome content of WT and Mfn2R707W/R707W white and brown preadipocytes, but these effects were blunted in Mfn2R707W/R707W cells. In male but not female Mfn2R707W/R707W mice, rapamycin reduced or reversed weight gain, reduced brown adipose mass, and increased serum Fgf21. Finally, a panel of other metabolic and pharmacological mitochondrial stressors solicited no selective death or ISR in Mfn2R707W/R707W preadipocytes. We conclude that ethanol mildly exacerbates MFN-MSL in mice, while rapamycin is tolerated. Lack of sensitisation to mitochondrial stressors implies that the MSL-inducing effect of MFN2 R707W may not be exerted through compromised oxidative phosphorylation."
"Nucleotide metabolism in pathogens is essential for their virulence, supporting growth, survival, and immune evasion during infection. Virulence in Staphylococcus aureus is driven by the production of virulence factors that facilitate nutrient acquisition and promote immune evasion and subversion. One key virulence regulatory system is the Sae two-component system (TCS), which upregulates the production of various virulence factors. The sensor histidine kinase SaeS, a member of the intramembrane family of histidine kinases (IM-HKs), lacks a signal-binding domain, leaving the mechanisms by which these HKs sense signals and regulate gene expression unclear. We report that de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is essential for maintaining Sae activity. Disruption of genes involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis reduces Sae-dependent promoter activity under pyrimidine-limited conditions. Phos-tag electrophoresis confirmed that pyrimidine limitation impacts SaeS kinase activity. The effect of pyrimidine limitation on SaeS was abrogated in a strain producing only the catalytic domain, suggesting that pyrimidines regulate SaeS activity at the membrane. Additionally, defective pyrimidine biosynthesis caused membrane defects and increased incorporation of free fatty acids into the membrane. Further, providing an extracellular sink for free fatty acids restored Sae activity in these mutants. Our study highlights the interplay between nucleotide metabolism and membrane integrity in regulating virulence factor expression through signal transduction systems in pathogens.

ImportanceVirulence is often correlated with nutrient depletion, but our understanding of this coordination is incomplete. In S. aureus, the Sae two-component system (Sae TCS) is a major regulator of virulence factor production and secretion, but as the sensor histidine kinase SaeS lacks an obvious domain to perceive its inducing signal, basic questions surrounding how the kinase is triggered persist. This study aims to investigate the mechanism by which pyrimidines act to promote the activity of the SaeS kinase in S. aureus and further expands on the importance of the roles of pyrimidines in regulating envelope biogenesis. Understanding this intersection between nucleotide metabolism and virulence regulation opens up the possibility for the development of targeted anti-virulence strategies against S. aureus infections."
"M42 peptidases are half-megadalton aminopeptidases characterized by a tetrahedral architecture (TET) ubiquitous across all domains of life. Despite their widespread occurrence, their evolutionary history and functional diversity remain largely unexplored. Here we show an unsuspected and largely untapped wealth of archaeal TET peptidases, exhibiting remarkable functional heterogeneity, as illustrated by the characterization of six novel enzymes. Using structural biology, phylogeny, and enzymatic studies, we establish robust criteria for high-throughput identification of TET peptidases and perform the first systematic study of their genomic distribution and functional diversity across the archaeal kingdom. We propose an 11-group classification for these enzymes and identify one group as the ancestral lineage that first emerged in Archaea. By coupling taxonomic distribution patterns with functional insights, we highlight the presence of multiple TET enzymes with selective activities in heterotrophic and mixotrophic organisms, suggesting a role for TET peptidases in the degradation of environmental peptides. Overall, this work illuminates the underexplored diversity of TET enzymes, uncovering a complex evolutionary history linked to their potential biological function."
"Compelling evidence demonstrates a functional link between neuronal activity and myelination, highlighting the vital importance of axon-oligodendrocyte crosstalk in myelin physiology and function. However, how neuronal activity is relayed to oligodendroglia to regulate myelin formation remains not fully understood. Here, we aimed to characterize how that myelination is regulated by glutamate vesicular release in zebrafish spinal cord. We compared oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and myelinating oligodendrocytes (mOLs) for their close apposition with pre-synaptic boutons and found that these are increased in number on mOLs during myelin internode elongation. Consistently, mOLs show more pre-synaptic boutons during myelin internode elongation compared to OPCs. In addition, we also found that oligodendroglial cells express the post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) along punctated domains, regardless of their differentiation stage. Genetically targeted PSD-95-GFP expression in oligodendroglia revealed post-synaptic-like domains along their processes and sheaths, which are contacted by axonal pre-synaptic varicosities. These contacts are increased in mOLs. Importantly, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion of dlg4 in oligodendroglia impairs myelin sheath growth, in vivo. Overall, our data indicate that PSD-95 is a key component of axons to oligodendrocytes neurotransmission that regulates myelin sheath growth.

"Anthropogenic climate change is altering the environment at unprecedented rates with severe consequences for most living organisms. As a result, species may extend, truncate, or shift their ranges in order to adapt to changing conditions. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) provide a data driven approach to predict future distributions under climate change and prioritize areas for conservation. Here, using a 10-year dataset with 4049 occurrence records of frogs from eight families and 27 genera as well as 733 occurrences of lizards from two families and 11 genera across the Western Ghats, we built SDMs to assess the changes in species distributions due to climate change. As expected, the temperature gradient across elevation and seasonality gradient across latitude contribute most to the climatic limits of species distributions. Latitudinal extents of most species were narrower in future predictions compared to the present, but there was little shift in latitudinal positions. On the other hand, most species shifted their distributions towards higher elevations, but the elevational range sizes remained the same. A total of 75 species of frogs (55%) and 15 species of lizards (45%) lose more than half of the suitable area, with few exceptions in both taxa that show an increase. In cases where a shift or increase in distribution was observed, the ability of the species to access and survive in these areas remains uncertain due to discontinuous topography and the presence of sister species. Overall, the frog and lizard fauna of the Western Ghats will be severely affected by climate change in the future due to a loss in climatic suitability."
"A definitive cure for HIV/AIDS does not exist yet and, thus, patients rely in antiretroviral therapy for life. In this scenario, the emergence of drug resistance is an important concern. The automatic prediction of resistance from HIV sequences is a fast tool for physicians to choose the best possible medical treatment. This paper proposes three kernel functions to deal with this data: one focused on single residue mutations, another on k-mers (close-range information in sequence), and another on pairwise interactions between amino acids (close and long-range information). Furthermore, the three kernels are able to deal with the categorical nature of HIV data and the presence of allelic mixtures. The experiments on the PI dataset from the Stanford Genotype-Phenotype database show that they generate prediction models with a very good performance, while remaining simple, open and interpretable. Most of the mutations and patterns they consider relevant are in agreement with previous literature. Also, this paper compares the different but complementary view that two kernel methods (SVM and kernel PCA) give over HIV data, showing that the former is focused on optimizing prediction while the latter summarizes the main patterns of genetic diversity, which in the Stanford Genotype-Phenotype database are related to drug resistance and HIV subtype."
"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are highly stable chemical contaminants of emerging concern for human and environmental health due to their non-natural chemistry, widespread use, and environmental persistence. Despite conventional metrology, mitigation strategies, and removal technologies, the complexity of this growing problem necessitates the need for alternative approaches to tackle the immense challenges associated with complex environmental PFAS contamination. Recently, biology has emerged as an alternative approach to detect and mitigate PFAS and understand the molecular-level responses of living organisms, including microorganisms, to these compounds. However, further study is needed to understand how microorganisms in different environments and growth phases respond to PFAS. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing at mid-exponential, early stationary phase, and late stationary phase of bacterial growth to determine the global transcriptional response of a model chassis, Escherichia coli MG1655, induced by two PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA), and equivalent non-fluorinated carboxylic acids (NFCA), octanoic acid and dodecanoic acid. Differential gene expression analysis revealed PFOA and PFDoA induced distinct changes in gene expression throughout cultivation. Specifically, we identified significant changes in expression of the formate regulon and sulfate assimilation at mid-exponential phase and ferrous iron transport, central metabolism, the molecular chaperone network, and motility processes during stationary phase. Importantly, many of these changes are not induced by NFCAs. In summary, we found PFAS induced a system-level change in gene expression, and our results expand the understanding of bacterial-PFAS interactions that could enable the development of future real-time environmental monitoring and mitigation technologies.

ImportanceThe prevalence and persistence of PFAS in the environment is a growing area of concern. However, little is understood of the impacts of PFAS on the environment, particularly impacts on microorganisms that play pivotal roles in nearly every ecosystem. Thus, comprehensive measurements that provide systems-level insight into how microorganisms respond and adapt to PFAS in the environment are paramount. Here, we use RNA sequencing to study the global transcriptional response of E. coli MG1655 to two PFAS and non-fluorinated equivalent compounds across growth phases. We find that PFAS induce system-level changes in metabolic, transport, and gene regulatory pathways, providing insight into how these non-natural chemicals interact with a model bacterium. Additionally, the transcriptomic dataset associated with this work provides the community with PFSA-specific gene expression patterns and possible PFAS degradation pathways for the development of future whole-cell biosensors and mitigation efforts."
"Microbial genome-wide association study (GWAS) tools often require manual data processing steps, lack comprehensive workflows, and are limited by scalability issues, thus hindering the exploration of bacterial genetic traits. To address these challenges, we developed BaGPipe, an automated and flexible bacterial GWAS pipeline built using Nextflow and incorporating Pyseer for association analysis. BaGPipe integrates all essential components of a bacterial GWAS--spanning pre-processing, statistical analysis, and downstream visualisation--into a unified workflow that is reproducible and easy to deploy across diverse computational environments. BaGPipe was validated on a publicly available dataset of Streptococcus pneumoniae whole-genome sequences, and reproduced published findings with improved computational efficiency. BaGPipe was then applied to a dataset of Staphylococcus aureus whole-genome sequences, successfully identifying known and novel antibiotic resistance associations. By offering an accessible, efficient, and reproducible platform, BaGPipe accelerates bacterial GWAS and facilitates deeper exploration into the genetic underpinnings of phenotypic traits.

Impact StatementThe increasing availability of bacterial genome sequences has created an opportunity for robust, reproducible tools to facilitate the discovery of novel genotype-phenotype associations. Despite the demonstrated utility of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in identifying genetic determinants of disease, toxicity and antibiotic resistance, existing tools for bacterial GWAS often involve fragmented workflows requiring extensive manual intervention, limiting their adoption and reproducibility. Here, we introduce BaGPipe, a fully integrated bacterial GWAS pipeline that automates pre-processing, statistical analysis, and visualisation, thereby streamlining the entire workflow. With its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use, BaGPipe makes bacterial GWAS more accessible to researchers, enabling faster and more reliable insights into microbial genetics. This is an important step towards overcoming the computational and logistical barriers that have constrained bacterial GWAS, ultimately accelerating research into microbial evolution, resistance mechanisms, and the genetic basis of other key phenotypic traits.

NGSTroubleFinder is implemented in Python and incorporates a custom-built parallelized pileup engine written in C. The tool reports extensive information on the samples both in textual and HTML format including key plots for easy interpretation of the results.

Availability and ImplementationNGSTroubleFinder is written in Python and C, and it can be easily installed with pip. The tool source code and the models are freely available on github (https://github.com/STALICLA-RnD/NGSTroubleFinder) and a containerized version is available on dockerhub (https://hub.docker.com/r/staliclarnd/ngstroublefinder)."
"Yellow fever (YF) is classically conceptualized as a hepatotropic disease; indeed, the liver is the primary site of yellow fever virus (YFV) replication. However, circumstantial evidence suggests that extra-hepatic disease may be important for the [~]30% of YF cases that progress to the severe ""intoxication"" phase of the disease. Using a Syrian hamster-adapted (HA)-YFV, we worked backwards from observations in humans to examine early events that precipitate the intoxication phase of YF. HA-YFV caused severe disease in [~]80% of infected animals characterized by lethargy and weight loss that progressed to widespread petechiae and death by day 6. Clinical chemistry, coagulation testing, histology, immunohistochemistry, and in-situ hybridization were consistent with a cascade of hepatocyte-specific virus replication causing liver damage and a defect in clotting factor synthesis. Despite a lack of extra-hepatic HA-YFV replication, severe pathology was observed in the intestines and pancreas. Histopathological analysis over the time-course of HA-YFV infection revealed an ischemic pattern in these tissues, culminating in fibrinoid/coagulative necrosis of these organs. Further investigation showed that ischemia-induced erosion of the gut epithelial barrier serves as an entry point for luminal bacteria that spread systemically via the portal system. Thus, the intoxication phase of YF is a sepsis-like syndrome caused by translocation of bacteria from a damaged gastrointestinal tract. Evaluation of human YF cases for these previously overlooked disease features confirmed this overarching mechanism: bacteria were identified in the portal vein and liver parenchyma of fatal YF cases along with elevations in plasma markers of bacteremia and a bacteria-driven inflammatory response. Importantly, blood concentrations of the gastrointestinal damage marker intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) were significantly elevated in fatal YF cases relative to non-fatal cases, suggesting that I-FABP measurements could be useful in prognosis and treatment decision making. Our findings tie together several recent and historically unexplained observations surrounding the highly-lethal intoxication phase of YF in humans: a high AST/ALT ratio, ""black vomit,"" pancreatitis, and paradoxical neutrophilia. A better appreciation for the drivers of mesenteric ischemia, and preemption of bacterial sepsis, may improve outcomes in cases of severe YF."
"1.Oyster aquaculture is a vital component of global marine ecosystems and food production, yet winter mortality events threaten both ecological stability and economic viability. Traditional selective breeding methods, reliant on phenotypic traits and slow generational cycles, struggle to address these challenges efficiently. This study introduces an innovative approach integrating machine learning with multi-omics data genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics to optimize oyster breeding for resilience and quality. By analyzing high-resolution datasets encompassing genetic markers, environmental stressors, and survival metrics, our ML models identified key SNPs linked to cold tolerance and disease resistance. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) accelerated breeding cycles, while predictive algorithms achieved 92.4% accuracy in forecasting survival and growth traits. Controlled trials demonstrated a 30% reduction in winter mortality and a 25% improvement in growth rates among ML-selected oyster lineages compared to traditional methods. Additionally, a smartphone-based diagnostic tool was developed to enable real-time monitoring of oyster health, empowering farmers to adapt feeding and environmental strategies dynamically.

This research bridges the gap between conventional aquaculture and computational innovation, offering a scalable framework to enhance genetic diversity, sustainability, and yield. By replacing trial-and-error practices with data-driven precision, our approach not only mitigates immediate industry challenges but also establishes a pathway for climate-resilient aquaculture. The fusion of ML with multi-omics technologies marks a transformative shift, enabling breeders to make rapid, evidence-based decisions that harmonize ecological stewardship with commercial demands."
"Metazoans comprise diverse tissues and cell types, each essential for the survival of the organism. Most of these cell types are established early in embryogenesis and persist into adulthood. However, in indirectly developing sea urchins, the continuity between embryonic and adult stages is thus interrupted by a planktonic larval stage that undergoes complete metamorphosis. In addition, while the gene regulatory networks governing distinct embryonic and larval cell lineages are well studied, the molecular and morphological identities of post-metamorphic sea urchin cell types remain poorly understood. Here, we reconstructed the cell type atlas of post-metamorphic Paracentrotus lividus juveniles using single-nucleus transcriptomics, shedding light on the conservation of genetic regulatory mechanisms in post-metamorphic cell types. We identified cell signatures corresponding to eight distinct cell type groups and analyzed at least twenty-nine neuronal cell families, including fifteen unique photoreceptor cell signatures. By combining single cell transcriptomics with spatial gene expression analysis and high-resolution electron microscopy, we identified homologues of vertebrate neuronal genes and photoreceptive opsins expressed throughout the sea urchin body. These findings provide evidence that the echinoderm body plan is not only predominantly head-like, but also exhibits an all-brain organization in an animal previously considered to have a primitive nervous system."
"Modern DNA-based biodiversity surveys result in massive-scale data, including up to millions of species - of which most are rare. Making the most of such data for inference and prediction requires modelling approaches that can relate species occurrences to environmental and spatial predictors, while incorporating information about their taxonomic or phylogenetic placement. Even if the scalability of joint species distribution models to large communities has greatly advanced, incorporating hundreds of thousands of species has not been feasible to date, leading to compromised analyses. Here we present a novel ""common to rare transfer learning"" approach (CORAL), based on borrowing information from the common species to enable statistically and computationally efficient modelling of both common and rare species. We illustrate that CORAL leads to much improved prediction and inference in the context of DNA metabarcoding data from Madagascar, comprising 255,188 arthropod species detected in 2874 samples."
"Three capsid types have been recognized from the nuclei of herpesvirus-infected cells: empty A-capsids, scaffolding-containing B-capsids, and DNA-filled C-capsids. Despite progress in determining atomic structures of these capsids and extracellular virions in recent years, debate persists concerning the origins and temporal relationships among these capsids during capsid assembly and genome packaging. Here, we have imaged over 300,000 capsids of herpes simplex virus type 1 by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) and exhaustively classified them to characterize the structural heterogeneity of the DNA-translocating portal complex and their functional states. The resultant atomic structures reveal not only the expected A-, B-, and C-capsids, but also capsids with portal vertices similar to C-capsids but no resolvable genome in the capsid lumen, which we named D-capsids. The dodecameric dsDNA-translocating portal complex varies across these capsid types in their radial positions in icosahedral capsids and exhibits structural dynamics within each capsid type. In D-capsids, terminal DNA density exists in multiple conformations including one reminiscent to that in C-capsids, suggesting D-capsids are products of failed DNA retention. This interpretation is supported by varying amounts of DNA outside individual D-capsids and by correlation of capsid counts observed in situ of infected cell nuclei and those after purification. Additionally, an ""anchoring"" segment of the scaffold protein is resolved interacting with the portal baskets of A- and B-capsids but not D- and C-capsids. Taken together, our data indicate that A-capsids arise from failed DNA packaging and D-capsids from failed genome retention, clarifying the origins of empty capsids in herpesvirus assembly.

SignificanceAs the prototypical herpesvirus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) exhibits a global seroprevalence of 67% and approaching 90% in some localities. Herpesvirus infections can cause devastating cancers and birth defects, with HSV-1 infections leading to cold sores among the general population worldwide and blindness in developing nations. Here, we present atomic structures of the capsids sorted out from the nuclear isolates of HSV-1 infected cells, including the previously recognized A-, B-, and C-capsids, as well as the newly identified D-capsid. The structures show the details of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions within each capsid type and the positional and interactional variability of the viral DNA-translocating portal vertex among these capsids. Importantly, our findings suggest that A-capsids are products of failed dsDNA packaging and D-capsids of failed genome retention. Together, the high-resolution 3D structures clarify the processes of genome packaging, maintenance, and ejection during capsid assembly, which are conserved across all herpesviruses."
"In Harrison, Bays, and Rideaux (2023), we presented evidence from electroencephalographical recordings of humans that there is an over representation of horizontal orientations in the visual cortex. Wolf and Rademaker (2024) raise concerns about an analysis used in our study and provide an alternative explanation for our results. Here we address their concerns and provide additional magnetencephalography data supporting the conclusions of our original study."
"Determining RNA 3D structure and conformers remains a grand challenge in structural biology. In this work, we propose trRosettaRNA2, a deep learning-based end-to-end approach to this problem. Considering the scarcity of RNA 3D structure data, trRosettaRNA2 integrates an auxiliary secondary structure (SS) prior module, pre-trained on extensive SS data, to generate informative base-pairing priors. This module also serves as an independent RNA secondary structure prediction method, trRNA2-SS, and achieves state-of-the-art performance. To enable end-to-end prediction, trRosettaRNA2 employs SS-aware attention to generate RNA 3D structure and conformers. Rigorous benchmarks demonstrate that trRosettaRNA2 outperforms other RNA 3D structure prediction methods, despite using significantly fewer parameters and computational resources. Notably, its flexibility in leveraging diverse secondary structure inputs provides a pathway to generate accurate 3D structure and explore the RNA conformers. Based on trRosettaRNA2, our group, Yang-Server, ranks as the top automated server for RNA structure prediction in the CASP16 blind test, surpassing AlphaFold3. This performance highlights that trRosettaRNA2 represents a solid step towards the ""AlphaFold moment"" for RNA structure prediction. Application to the RNase P RNA demonstrates that trRosettaRNA2 successfully captures its structural heterogeneity even without requiring experimental data, showing its potential to predict RNA conformational ensembles."
"Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) plays a critical role in regulating intracellular calcium signaling and is essential for immune cell functions. SOCE blockade with pyrazole derivative BTP2 has been explored as an anti-inflammatory strategy in preclinical models and Zegocractin (CM4620) is being investigated in Phase 2 clinical trials as an immunoregulatory agent. However, the mode of action and differential effects of SOCE blockade on diverse immune cell types remain largely unknown, limiting the precision of current therapeutic applications. Here, we used multiplexed single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the effects of two prototypic SOCE blockers, BTP2 and CM4620, on polyclonally-stimulated, normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The data revealed that SOCE blockade suppresses the expression of cytotoxicity-associated genes in CD8{square} effector T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, restoring them to levels comparable to those in unstimulated cells. Strikingly, SOCE blockade preserved activation-induced expression of anti-inflammatory genes in CD4{square} regulatory T cells, maintaining their tolerance phenotype even after SOCE blockade. These findings suggest that SOCE blockers modulate immune responses with greater selectivity than conventional immunosuppressants by reducing cytotoxicity while preserving tolerance-associated pathways, highlighting their potential for managing immune-mediated conditions, including organ transplantation.

KEY POINTSO_LISOCE blockers BTP2 and CM4620 reduce cytotoxic gene expression in CD8{square} T cells and NK cells.

"AimObesity in pregnant women increases offspring cardiovascular risk and causes fetal cardiac dysfunction. The underpinning mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesised that circulating factors in serum from fetuses of women with obesity induce pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

MethodsPregnant women with obesity or healthy weight were recruited at term and provided umbilical cord serum and placentas, which were used for isolation of primary trophoblast cells. Primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from neonatal rats.

ResultsCompared to serum-free medium, supplementing cardiomyocytes with umbilical cord serum increased their mRNA expression of atrial natriuretic factor (Anf) and brain natriuretic peptide (Bnp), hallmarks of pathological hypertrophy, but did not alter their size. Cord serum from women with obesity further upregulated cardiomyocyte Anf and Bnp, and increased the ratio of beta- to alpha-myosin heavy chain expression (Myh7:Myh6), compared to cord serum from healthy weight women. This effect was prevented by treating the cord serum with heat- freeze cycling and DNase or RNase digestion. Conditioned medium from trophoblast cells from women with obesity also increased cardiomyocyte Anf, Bnp and Myh7:Myh6 expression. MicroRNAs miR-142 and miR-17, which are associated with cardiac function, were increased in abundance in extracellular vesicles isolated from cord serum from women with obesity. However, miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p and miR-17-5p did not increase Anf, Bnp or Myh7:Myh6 expression when they were transfected into cardiomyocytes.

ConclusionThe results show that human fetal circulating and placenta-derived factors induce hallmarks of pathological hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes and may mediate cardiac dysfunction in children of women with obesity."
"Translocating unfolded polypeptides across membranes is essential in all domains of life and in bacteria requires the conserved Sec machinery and ATP. Bacterial Sec substrates fold outside the cell and often use DsbA-catalysed disulfide bond formation between cysteines to ensure correct folding. Extracellular protein misfolding triggers a stress response that involves production of dual function HtrA-family chaperone/proteases. In Gram-negative bacteria this is called the envelope stress response and in Gram-positive bacteria the secretion stress response, but the exact signals sensed by bacteria to trigger these stress responses are not well understood. In Streptomyces bacteria the secretion stress response is mediated by the CutRS and CssRS two-component systems which control the levels of four conserved HtrA-family chaperones. Here we show that the CutS sensor kinase contains two conserved cysteine residues in its extracellular sensor domain that control CutS activity. CssS also has two conserved and invariant cysteines in its sensor domain, and we propose that CutS and CssS detect the extracellular redox state and work together to ensure secreted proteins fold correctly in the fluctuating soil environment. Further analysis of [~]12,800 genomes indicated that 98.9% of strains across all bacterial classes have at least one sensor kinase with two or more extracellular cysteine residues, suggesting that extracellular redox sensing by two-component systems is widespread in bacteria."
"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a critical public health challenge, causing over 1.5 million deaths annually. Rising resistance to existing TB antibiotics threatens to reverse decades of progress in combating the disease. Developing new antibiotics is challenging due to high development costs and failure rates. Artificial intelligence offers a promising solution to streamline early drug discovery by predicting inhibitory properties of novel compounds, generating molecules with desired properties, and automating workflows through large language model agents. In this work, we introduce Fleming, an AI agent designed for TB antibiotic discovery. We curated and generated the largest dataset of TB inhibitors to date (n=114,933), and used these data to train both discriminative and generative models for TB inhibitor identification. Fleming orchestrates four specialized agents--a bacterial inhibition prediction agent, a molecular generation agent, a molecular optimization agent, and an ADMET agent--to perform key tasks in early TB antibiotic discovery. These agents incorporate literature search capabilities and chemical optimization tools, creating an integrated platform for TB antibiotic discovery. Using experimental data and human medicinal chemist review, we demonstrate how Fleming enhances the antibiotic discovery process, and mirrors the decision-making of medicinal chemists through an intuitive natural language interface."
"Homologous recombination (HR) is essential for the maintenance of genome stability and for generating genetic diversity during meiosis. The eukaryotic protein Rad51 is member of the Rad51/RecA family of DNA recombinases and is responsible for guiding the DNA pairing reactions that take place in HR during mitosis. Dmc1 is a meiosis-specific paralog of Rad51 and is responsible for the DNA pairing reactions that take place in HR during meiosis. Rad51 and Dmc1 are both ATP-dependent DNA-binding proteins and both form extended helical filaments on ssDNA which are key intermediates in HR. The stability of these nucleoprotein filaments is highly regulated and is also tightly coupled to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. ATP binding promotes filament assembly whereas the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP reduces filament stability to promote filament disassembly. Here, we present CryoEM structures of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae recombinases Rad51 and Dmc1 in the ADP-bound states and provide a detailed structural comparison to the ATP-bound filaments. Our findings yield insights into the structural transitions that take place during the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and suggest a new model for how these structural changes may be linked to nucleoprotein filament disassembly."
"Emotional experiences are never static but continuously evolve in response to internal and external contexts. Little is known about how neural patterns change as a function of these experiences, particularly in response to complex, real-world stimuli. This study aimed to identify generalizable neural patterns as individuals collectively engage and disengage from emotions dynamically. To do so, we analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) along with subjective emotional annotations from two independent studies as individuals watched negative and neutral movie clips. We used predictive modeling to test if a model trained to predict a group emotional signature response in one study generalizes to the other study and vice versa. Disengagement patterns generalized specifically across intense clips. They were supported by connections within and between the sensorimotor and salience networks, maybe reflecting the processing of feeling states as individuals regulate their emotions. Prediction success for the engagement signature was mixed, primarily linked to connections within the visual and between the visual and dorsal attention networks, supporting visual attention orienting as emotions intensify. This work offers potential pathways for identifying generalizable neural patterns contributing to future affective research and clinical applications aiming to better understand dynamic emotional responses to naturalistic stimuli."
"ESKAPE pathogens include Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp., which account for the major causes of mortality linked to the spread of infection and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) globally. Advances in omics approaches have pointed to bacteriophages as a promising alternative source of antibacterial agents. Here we enriched two samples from sewage and amplified them on Staphylococcus culture, followed by whole metagenome shotgun sequencing with Illumina NovaSe X. We performed metagenomic classification of high-quality sequence reads using the Kraken 2 database, to delineate the diversity and abundances of taxa. Thereafter we assembled the sequence reads with MAGAHIT and binned them with default parameters of the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) before annotating each bin with PhageScope. From assembly, we recovered multiple metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) including Alistipes phage, Escherichia phage, Vibrio phage, Staphylococcus phage, Klebsiella phage and Acinetobacter phage, to mention the top six best hits. From annotation, while the Acinetobacter phage is virulent, the two Klebsiella phage and Staphylococcus phage are temperate. All the phages possess more than four lysis genes, with the potential to disrupt bacterial membranes. Exceptionally, Vibrio phage, Acinetobacter phage and Alistipes phage possess anti-CRISPR genes, the potential to counteract normal bacterial immune response to phage infection. These findings also inform that MAGs from the sewage have the potential to recover phages with anti-CRISPR/Cas activity, which is one of the desirable attributes for effective phage-bacterial infection to control the growth and multiplication of bacteria. Our datasets can be utilized for genome-guided selection of potent phages through lytic and host-range assays, towards the purification of endolysins (lysozymes) as alternative antibacterial agents.

"Over the past 30 years, software for searching tandem mass spectrometry data against a protein database has improved dramatically in speed and statistical power. However, existing tools can still struggle to analyze truly massive datasets, when either the number of spectra or the number of proteins being analyzed grows too large. Here we describe enhancements to the Tide search engine that allow it to handle datasets containing >10 million spectra and databases containing >7 billion peptides on commodity hardware. We demonstrate that the new Tide architecture is around 2-7 times faster than the previous version and is now comparable to MSFragger and Sage in speed while requiring much less memory. Tide is open source and is publicly available as pre-compiled binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac."
"Staphylococcus aureus utilises a type VII secretion system (T7SS) to secrete antibacterial toxins that target competitor bacteria. EsxX is a T7SS substrate protein secreted by ST398 strains that has an LXG domain at its N-terminus. Here we show that the EsxX C-terminus is a membrane-depolarising toxin with a glycine zipper motif. EsxX is profoundly toxic to bacteria, displaying toxicity from both cytoplasmic and extracellular compartments. A pair of polytopic membrane proteins, ExiCD, protect cells from intoxication by extracellular EsxX. By contrast, a distinct soluble heterodimer, ExiAB, neutralises cytoplasmic EsxX by sequestration of its glycine zipper motif in a binding groove on ExiB. The exiA-exiB gene pair co-occur in staphylococcal genomes with esxX, invoking a model whereby ExiAB protects EsxX-producing cells from self-toxicity prior to EsxX secretion. By contrast ExiCD is encoded by both EsxX producers and in antitoxin islands of competitor strains that do not encode EsxX, consistent with providing immunity against the secreted form of the toxin. This work defines a new class of antibacterial toxin requiring two distinct types of immunity protein which follow different phylogenetic distributions."
"Deep learning has made remarkable progress in protein design, yet current protein representations remain largely black-box and scale poorly with protein length, leading to high computational costs. We propose a fragment-based protein representation that balances interpretability and efficiency. Using a curated set of 40 evolutionarily conserved fragments, we represent proteins as fragment sets or fragment graphs, significantly reducing dimensionality while preserving functional information. Here, we show that fragment-based representations capture significantly more information at much lower dimensions compared to traditional methods. On a dataset of 215 functionally diverse proteins, our approach outperforms traditional sequence- and structure-based methods in clustering by protein function at[&le;] 30% sequence identity. Additionally, fragment-based search achieves comparable accuracy while using 90% fewer tokens. It also runs[~] 68.7x faster than RMSD-based methods and[~] 1.64x faster than sequence-based methods, even when including fragment pre-processing overhead. Finally, we show that fragments can guide RFDiffusion backbone generation, with recovery rates higher than 40%. We propose fragment-based representations as a scalable and interpretable alternative for the next generation of protein design tools, spanning backbone and sequence design to functional searches in protein structure databases."
"The Lotka-Volterra equations, a cornerstone of predator-prey modeling, provide a valuable frame-work for understanding sustainable population dynamics. This chapter explores how these equations, through analysis of dynamic equilibrium and stability, illuminate sustainability principles within ecological systems. By analyzing predator-prey interactions, we gain important insights into population management, resource conservation, and the delicate balance of ecosystems. Furthermore, we discuss the broader implications of the Lotka-Volterra model, highlighting its potential to inform our understanding of complex systems dynamics in various fields. These include their relevance to educational frameworks, where the model can enhance student engagement with sustainability concepts and foster a deeper understanding of systems thinking."
"Whole-body regeneration requires adult stem cells with high plasticity to differentiate into missing cell types. Planarians possess a unique configuration of organs embedded in a vast pool of pluripotent stem cells. How stem cells integrate positional information with discrete fates remains unknown. Here, we use the planarian pharynx to define the cell fates that depend on the pioneer transcription factor FoxA. We find that Roundabout receptor RoboA suppresses aberrant pharynx cell fates by altering foxA expression, independent of the canonical ligand Slit. An RNAi screen for extracellular proteins identifies Anosmin-1 as a potential partner of RoboA. Perturbing global patterning demonstrates that roboA/anosmin-1 functions locally in the brain. By contrast, altering pharynx fate with foxA knockdown induces head-specific neurons in the pharynx, indicating a latent plasticity of stem cells. Our data links critical extracellular cues with cell fate decisions of highly plastic stem cells, ensuring the fidelity of organ regeneration."
"BACKGROUNDJuxtaglomerular (JG) cells are sensors that control blood pressure (BP) and fluid-electrolyte homeostasis. They are arranged as clusters at the tip of each afferent arteriole. In response to a decrease in BP or extracellular fluid volume, JG cells secrete renin, initiating an enzymatic cascade that culminates in the production of angiotensin II (AngII), a potent vasoconstrictor that restores BP and fluid-electrolyte homeostasis. In turn, AngII exerts negative feedback on renin release concomitantly with increased intracellular Ca2+, preventing excessive circulating renin and hypertension. However, within their native structural organization, the intricacies of intracellular Ca2+ signaling dynamics and their sources remain uncharacterized.

METHODSWe generated mice expressing the JG cell-specific genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator (GCaMP6f) to investigate Ca2+ dynamics within JG cell clusters ex vivo and in vivo. For ex vivo Ca2+ imaging, acutely prepared kidney slices were perfused continuously with a buffer containing variable Ca2+ and AngII concentrations {+/-} Ca2+ channel inhibitors. For in vivo Ca2+ image capture, native mouse kidneys were imaged in situ using multi-photon microscopy with and without AngII administration. ELISA measurements of renin concentrations determined acute renin secretion ex vivo and in vivo, respectively.

RESULTSEx vivo Ca2+ imaging revealed that JG cells exhibit robust and coordinated intracellular oscillatory signals with cell-cell propagation following AngII stimulation. AngII dose-dependently induced stereotypical burst patterns characterized by consecutive Ca2+ spikes, which inversely correlated with renin secretion. Pharmacological channel inhibition identified key sources of these oscillations: endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ storage and release, extracellular Ca2+ uptake via ORAI channels, and intercellular communication through gap junctions. Blocking ORAI channels and gap junctions reduced AngII inhibitory effect on renin secretion. In vivo Ca2+ imaging demonstrated robust intracellular and intercellular Ca2+ oscillations within JG cell clusters under physiological conditions, exhibiting spike patterns consistent with those measured in ex vivo preparations. Administration of AngII enhanced the Ca2+ oscillatory signals and suppressed acute renin secretion in vivo.

CONCLUSIONAngII elicits coordinated intracellular and intercellular Ca2+ oscillations within JG cell clusters, ex vivo and in vivo. The effect is driven by endoplasmic reticulum-derived Ca2+ release, ORAI channels, and gap junctions, leading to suppressed renin secretion."
"Predictive cues significantly influence perception through associative learning. However, it is unknown whether circuits are conserved across domains. We investigated how associative learning influences perceived intensity and valence of pain and hedonic taste and whether the mechanisms that support expectancy-based modulation vary as a function of aversiveness and modality. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to receive either painful heat, unpleasant liquid saline, or pleasant liquid sucrose during fMRI scanning. Following conditioning, cues that were initially associated with low or high intensity outcomes were intermittently followed by stimuli calibrated to elicit medium intensity ratings. Learned cues modulated expectations and subjective outcomes similarly across domains. Consistent with this, the orbitofrontal cortex exhibited domain-general anticipatory activation. The left anterior insula mediated domain-general cue effects on subjective intensity, whereas the thalamus mediated cue effects on subjective valence. Notably, these two regions were nearly identical to those previously implicated in mediating cue effects on pain (nearly identical to those previously implicated in cue effects on mediating pain (Atlas et al., 2010). Pain specificity was evident when we measured variations in stimulus intensity, whether we used univariate or multivariate approaches, but there was minimal evidence of specificity by modality or aversiveness when we examined cue effects on medium trials. These findings suggest that shared neural circuits mediate the effects of learned expectations on perception, linking pain with other areas of affective processing and perception across domains."
"Bacteria and cancer cells inhabit spatially heterogeneous environments, where migration shapes microhabitat structures critical for colonization and metastasis. The interplay between growth, migration, and spatial structure complicates the prediction of population responses to drug treatment - such as clearance or persistence - even under the same spatially averaged growth rate. Accurately predicting these responses is essential for designing effective treatment strategies. Here, we propose a minimal growth-migration model to study population dynamics on discrete microhabitat structures under spatial drug heterogeneity. By applying a kernel transformation, we map the original structure to an effective fully connected graph and derive a new exact criterion for population response based on a regularized Laplacian kernel reweighted by local growth rates. This criterion connects to forest closeness centrality and yields analytical bounds and sufficient conditions for population growth or decline. We find that higher structural connectivity - like increased migration - generally promotes decline. Our framework also informs optimal spatial drug assignments, which reduce to selecting interconnected subcores in the effective complete graph. For partially controllable microhabitats or unknown drug distributions, we identify strategies that ensure population decline. Overall, our results offer a new theoretical perspective on drug response in spatially structured populations and provide practical guidance for optimizing spatially explicit dosing strategies in heterogeneous environments."
"Identifying cell intrinsic regulators of immune sexual dimorphism is critical for treatment of several immunopathologies. We show that Malat1 is required for appropriate cytokine expression in female but not male Th2 cells. Malat1 deficiency impairs in vitro Th2 differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells from female mice, characterised by transcriptome-wide effects and suppression of cytokine expression, particularly IL10. Upon IL10R blockade a pronounced effect is also seen on IL4 and IL13. Mechanistically, naive CD4+ T cells from Malat1-/- female mice demonstrate altered early activation kinetics and impaired early differentiation gene expression, including up-regulation of an interferon stimulated gene (ISG) module. This is followed by suppression of IL2R and IL2R{gamma} expression and IL2-mediated differentiation. Mimicking the effect of Malat1 loss by maintaining early ISG expression in WT cells with IFN{beta} treatment partially phenocopies the effects of Malat1 deficiency. A subset of the effects of Malat1 loss in female cells is also observed in male cells. However, this does not affect endpoint Th2 differentiation. Male CD4+ T cells demonstrate stronger early activation, higher ISG expression during early differentiation, maintenance of IL2R expression independently of Malat1, and lower sensitivity to exogenous IL2 during late differentiation compared to female cells. In vivo, female, but not male, Malat1-/- mice demonstrate altered Th2 cytokine expression characterised by a reduction in IL10+ Th2 cells in both lung and spleen following priming and challenge with Schistosoma mansoni eggs, a model of lung type 2 inflammation. Overall, these findings reveal Malat1 as a novel determinant of immune sexual dimorphism."
"Protein phosphorylation is a common and essential post-translational modification that affects biochemical properties and regulates biological activities. Phosphorylation is particularly common for intrinsically disordered proteins and can significantly modulate their function and potential to interact with binding partners. To understand the biophysical origins of how phosphorylation of disordered proteins influences their function, it is valuable to investigate how the modifications lead to changes in their conformational ensembles. Here, we have used a top-down data-driven approach to develop a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model compatible with the CALVADOS protein simulation model to study the effects of serine and threonine phosphorylation on the global structural properties of disordered proteins. We parameterise the model using experimental data on the effects of phosphorylation on global dimensions. By comparing with baseline models and simulations using the phosphomimetics aspartate and glutamate, we show that the effect of phosphorylation on the global dimensions of disordered proteins is mostly driven by the additional charge. We envisage that our model can be applied to study the effects of phosphorylation of disordered proteins at the proteome scale as well as to study the important roles of protein phosphorylation on phase separation."
"In 2010, a Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae biovar 3 (Psa3) incursion into New Zealand kiwifruit orchards devastated susceptible Actinidia chinensis cultivars. In contrast, many Actinidia species maintained in germplasm collections were resistant to Psa3 and showed limited symptoms. Recent genome biosurveillance revealed the emergence of widespread leaf spot symptoms in Psa3-resistant Actinidia germplasm. Surprisingly, few Psa3 isolates were recovered from symptomatic tissues, despite the frequent isolation of phenotypical Pseudomonas isolates on selective agar. Despite the poor recovery of Psa3 isolates, Psa3 was found in all symptomatic leaf tissue through qPCR and metabarcoding analysis. Metabarcoding revealed stark differences in bacterial community composition from samples taken from lesion-carrying or lesion-free material from the same leaf. Host genotype also appeared to influence community composition but to a lesser extent. Whole genome sequencing of diverse Pseudomonas spp. isolates revealed that many belonged to the P. syringae species complex. Curiously, the kiwifruit-associated P. syringae pv. actinidifoliorum (Pfm), was never recovered, nor were any other phylogroup 1 pathovars. Pathogenicity and competitive assays revealed that while individually diverse Pseudomonas isolates were not more pathogenic than Pfm or Psa3 on resistant Actinidia hosts, they could interact with Psa to sometimes improve their growth, suggesting that these isolates may form pathogenic consortia in these disease-associated phyllosphere communities on typically Psa3-resistant hosts.

"Resistance breeding offers invaluable perspectives for environment-friendly crop protection, but its success may be limited by the breakdown of plant resistance by pathogen strains. This threat is particularly acute for perennial crops, which may be cultivated for several decades. With the increasing use of new varieties carrying multiple major resistance loci, grapevine (Vitis spp.) represents a distinctive model to investigate the broad agreement that combining several resistance genes (pyramiding) enhances both resistance efficacy and durability. To this end, grapevine progenies segregating for four resistance loci against Plasmopara viticola (Rpvs) were used to evaluate the efficiency of single and pyramided major loci when confronted to naive and Rpv-breaking pathogen strains. In the context of polygenic resistance, both undefeated and defeated Rpvs provided significant quantitative effects. However, interactions between pyramided Rpvs were either beneficial, neutral or detrimental to the level of resistance, depending on the loci combination and pathogen strain. In particular, the fact that the presence of defeated resistance loci may compromise the resistance provided by functional major loci has important implications for crops resistance breeding. Thorough phenotypic investigations of pyramiding breeding schemes emerge as a critical step for the effective and durable management of genetic resistances and plant diseases."
"The impact of missense genetic variations on protein function is often enigmatic, especially for mutations that map to intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Given the functional importance of phase separation of IDRs, it has been proposed that mutations that modulate phase separation might preferentially lead to disease. To examine this idea, we used the robust predictability of phase-separating (PS) IDRs and annotation of disease-associated proteins and mutations to map the correlation between disease and phase separation. Consistent with previous work linking phase separation to cancer and autism spectrum disorder, we find a higher prevalence of predicted phase separation behavior in disease-associated proteins than typical for human proteins. We map the prevalence of phase separation across a wide range of diseases, finding that most, but not all, show an enrichment of phase separation in the proteins associated with them. Strikingly, the frequency of pathogenic mutations in predicted PS IDRs was elevated three-fold relative to IDRs not predicted to phase separate. Substitutions involving arginine and the aromatic types were among the most pathogenic for PS IDRs, while substitutions involving serine, threonine, and alanine the most benign. We applied these trends to mutations of uncertain clinical significance and predict that half found in PS IDRs are likely pathogenic. We find that phosphorylation sites were enriched in PS IDRs when compared to other protein regions, though mutations at such sites were mostly benign. Pathogenicity was highest for mutations in predicted PS IDRs when also found in a short linear motif, known mediators of protein-protein interactions."
"Under starvation conditions, B. subtilis survives by differentiating into one of two cell types: biofilm matrix-producing cells or sporulating cells. These two cell-differentiation pathways are activated by the same phosphorylated transcription factor - Spo0A~P. Despite sharing the activation mechanism, these cell fates are mutually exclusive at the single-cell level. This decision has been shown to be controlled by the effects of growth rate on gene dosage and protein dilution in the biofilm matrix production network. In this work, we explore an alternative mechanism of growth rate-mediated control of this cell fate decision. Namely, using deterministic and stochastic modeling, we investigate how the growth-rate-dependent pulsing dynamics of Spo0A~P affect biofilm matrix deactivation and activation. Specifically, we show that the Spo0A~P pulsing frequency tunes the biofilm matrix deactivation probability without affecting the probability of biofilm matrix activation. Interestingly, we found that DNA replication is the cell cycle stage that most substantially contributes to the deactivation of biofilm matrix production. Finally, we report that the deactivation of biofilm matrix production is not primarily regulated by the effects of growth rate on gene dosage and protein dilution. Instead, it is driven by changes in the pulsing period of Spo0A~P. In summary, our findings elucidate the mechanism governing biofilm deactivation during the late stages of starvation, thereby advancing our understanding of how bacterial networks interpret dynamic transcriptional regulatory signals to control stress-response pathways.

Author SummaryBacteria have evolved various adaptation mechanisms to survive under challenging environmental conditions. For instance, under mild starvation, B. subtilis bacteria form biofilms -- communities of cells encapsulated in a protective extracellular matrix. On the other hand, these bacteria differentiate into highly resistant spores under severe starvation. Interestingly, sporulating cells are often found within biofilm communities, but they do not contribute to biofilm matrix production. This is thought to be an energy-conservation strategy, as biofilm formation is an energy-intensive process and is therefore halted before sporulation begins. Though previous work has focused on the mechanisms driving biofilm disassembly, few studies have explored the regulatory processes that B. subtilis employs to halt matrix production prior to starting sporulation. In this study, we use mathematical models to demonstrate that the temporal dynamics of the biofilm master regulator Spo0A~P control the deactivation of matrix production. Understanding the regulation of biofilm, a common lifestyle in bacteria, can lead to the development of synthetic strategies to either enhance or disrupt biofilm formation, with potential applications in medicine and industry."
"We investigated the G-quadruplex binding selectivity of short aromatic oligoamide helical foldamers comprising quinoline (Q) and pyridine (P) units. We found that the foldamers prefer parallel G-quadruplex structures, especially when the external G-quartets are sterically accessible. A crystal structure of the tetramer QQPQ with the parallel G-quadruplex formed by dTGGGTTGGGTTGGGTTGGGT shows two quinoline subunits interacting with an external G-quartet through {pi}-stacking, and solution NMR confirms that the foldamer targets the 3 and 5 ends of this G-quadruplex. Foldamers can also selectively target sequence variants of the telomeric sequences containing adenine-to-thymine mutation in the loops. The conformational selectivity of foldamers originates from the bulkiness of oligomers with four or more subunits, which imposes steric restrictions on G-quadruplex binding. The flexibility provided by the pyridine subunits was also key to improve affinity. Mixed quinoline-pyridine foldamers are thus a promising class of selective G-quadruplex ligands, and their unique modular scaffold offers new avenues to further improve their affinity and selectivity."
"Single-cell genomics methods have unveiled the heterogeneity present in seemingly homogenous populations of cells, however, these techniques require meticulous optimization. How exactly does one handle and manipulate the biological contents from a single cell? Here, we introduce and characterize a novel semi-permeable capsule (SPC), capable of isolating single cells and their contents while facilitating biomolecular exchange based on size-selectivity. These capsules maintain stability under diverse physical and chemical conditions and allow selective diffusion of biomolecules, effectively retaining larger biomolecules including genomic DNA, and cellular complexes, while permitting the exchange of smaller molecules, including primers and enzymes. We demonstrate the utility of SPCs for single cell assays by performing the simultaneous culture of over 500,000 cellular colonies, demonstrating efficient and unbiased nucleic acid amplification, and performing combinatorial indexing-based single-cell whole genome sequencing (sc-WGS). Notably, SPC-based sc-WGS facilitates uniform genome coverage and minimal cross-contamination allowing for the detection of genomic variants with high sensitivity and specificity. Leveraging these properties, we conducted a proof-of-concept lineage tracing experiment using cells harboring the hypermutator polymerase {varepsilon} allele (POLE P286R). Sequencing of 1000 single cell genomes at low depth facilitated the capture of lineage marks deposited throughout the genome during each cell division and the subsequent reconstruction of cellular genealogies. Capsule-based sc-WGS expands the single-cell genomics toolkit and will facilitate the investigation of somatic variants, resolved to single cells at scale."
"BackgroundNon-encapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae (NESp) represent up to 19% of circulating pneumococci and exhibit high rates of antimicrobial resistance. Saliva is increasingly used as a pneumococcal carriage study specimen, and we recently developed a qPCR assay to enhance carriage surveillance and characterization of NESpn in saliva. Previous work has established that pneumococci remain viable in unsupplemented saliva for extended periods under various conditions, however these findings may not be applicable to NESp. Therefore, to ensure the robustness of NESp detection in saliva-based carriage studies we evaluated the impact of transport and storage conditions of saliva samples on NESp detection.

MethodsSix NESp strains from two clinically relevant NESp null capsule clades (NCC), NCC1 (carrying pspK) and NCC2 (carrying aliC and aliD), were spiked into lytA-negative saliva and incubated through various temperatures and freeze-thaw conditions. Endpoints were processed using either culture-enrichment and DNA extraction (CE-DNA), or an extraction-free method without CE, before testing for lytA using qPCR. Detection stability was assessed using regression modelling over temperature, time and freeze-thaws.

ResultsFollowing CE-DNA, detection of NESp remained stable for [&le;]24 or [&le;]72 hours when stored at room temperature or 4{degrees}C, respectively, and over 2 freeze-thaw cycles (-80{degrees}C), with glycerol-supplementation providing slight benefits. Stability of detection when using CE-DNA depended on NCC; detection of NCC2 strains was lower, and less stable than NCC1. Compared to CE-DNA, extraction-free detection was more stable, with no significant loss over 72 hours at room temperature and over 3 freeze-thaw cycles. With extraction-free detection, there were also negligible diderences in detection between NCC1 and NCC2. Additionally, extraction-free detection of NCC1, and less so NCC2, increased over the first 24 hours when stored at 20-30{degrees}C, suggesting growth in saliva. Testing of{Delta} aliCaliD and{Delta} pspK mutants revealed these genes increased in vitro viability of NCC2 and NCC1, respectively, but did not significantly alter competitive fitness during CE.

ConclusionNCC1 NESp strains exhibit similar stability patterns in unsupplemented saliva as encapsulated pneumococci. NCC2 strains, however, are less resilient during CE, likely due to competition with other oral microbes. Therefore, recovery of NCC2 NESp may be impacted by transport and storage conditions, leading to an underestimation of carriage prevalence when tested using CE-based methods. For the reliable carriage surveillance of NESp, samples should be stored at 4{degrees}C soon after collection and at -80{degrees}C within 72 hours. Methods which directly detect DNA without CE may provide a less biased accounting of NCC2 strains."
"Neuroimmune communication is known to control various regulatory systems in the body. Serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine, HT) is one of the neurotransmitters produced predominantly by enterochromaffin cells in the gut and the neurons of the central nervous system. Immune and cancer cells express several HT receptors (HTRs), and how HTRs modulate various immune pathways and contribute to cancer growth and metastasis is unclear. RNA-seq data analysis shows that human colon adenocarcinoma tissues with high HTR2B expression are associated with poor anti-tumor immune response and poor patient survival. Using an orthotopic mouse model of tumors, we show that HTR2B and other serotonergic molecule expressions are positively associated with colon tumor progression. Antagonizing the HTR2B using specific chemical antagonists significantly suppresses the progression of colon, breast, and melanoma tumors and metastasis in mice by promoting antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cell response and downregulating the PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. Further, treatment with a combination of suboptimal doses of HTR2B antagonists and suboptimal doses of immunotherapy (anti-PD1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA4 mAb) or chemotherapeutic drugs (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, or irinotecan) showed a robust anti-tumor response and inhibited colon tumor growth. Our finding showed that antagonizing the HTR2B holds a potent therapeutic advantage as a combinatorial regimen of either immunotherapy or chemotherapy to treat colon cancer.

One sentence summaryHTR2B expression is associated with colon tumor progression, and antagonizing the HTR2B inhibits tumor growth and metastasis."
"The societal effects of childrens learning in cultural evolution have been underexplored. Here, we investigate using agent-based models how a propensity for early exploration in childhood contributes to cultural adaptation and the evolution of long human childhood. Using a complex cultural task, we implemented a two-stage strategy for exploring this space - children explore broadly, more likely to learn new behaviours, while adults exploit behaviours already known, incrementally improving them. We found that populations that followed this two-stage strategy achieved higher payoffs in the long term than populations using the two exploration strategies in a random order. Our models point at a  just right length of childhood - neither too long, nor too short - allowing individuals enough time to explore before exploiting what they learned. Social learning increased payoffs when agents could copy individuals of a variety of ages. Payoffs decreased under environmental change, especially for long childhoods, because adults did not have enough time to recover between bouts of change."
"Working memory supports goal-directed behavior by maintaining task-relevant information. However, a growing number of studies shows that even task-irrelevant features are automatically encoded and can interfere with the recall of task-relevant information. While this phenomenon is well documented in unisensory contexts, it remains unclear whether and how task-irrelevant information persists in multisensory working memory. We examine the role of cross-modal binding by tracking the dynamic neural representation of audio-visual objects under varying selective attention conditions, using an EEG-based audio-visual delayed-match-to-sample task. Participants attended to either auditory or visual features (selective attention), or to both features (conjunction) of two sequential audio-visual items and subsequently compared those task-relevant features to an audio-visual probe. Further, to investigate the influence of bottom-up factors on cross-modal binding, we manipulated spatial congruency by presenting both features from either the same (i.e., in the center) or from disparate positions. Behaviorally, task-irrelevant features interfered with performance even under selective attention, consistent with automatic cross-modal binding and encoding into working memory. This interference was even stronger with spatially disparate presentation, suggesting that bottom-up attentional dynamics strengthen cross-modal bindings and their subsequent storage. Condition-level representational similarity analysis (RSA) showed that EEG activity patterns under selective attention more closely resembled those of conjunction trials than unisensory trials, indicating that task-irrelevant features were incorporated into multisensory object-level representations. This conjunction-similarity persisted in attend-visual trials, but declined over time in attend-auditory trials, reflecting partial filtering of task-irrelevant orientations. Crucially, activity patterns never shifted fully towards an auditory-only profile, indicating that irrelevant visual features were not fully excluded. In addition, feature-level RSA corroborated that both sound frequency-specific and orientation-specific information were present in EEG activity patterns, irrespective of the attended modality. Overall, these results demonstrate the persistence of task-irrelevant information in multisensory working memory and offer critical insights into how attentional processes shape its representational architecture."
"Sensory substitution devices (SSDs) convert images to sounds to equip blind individuals with nominally visual functions, like face or letter sensitivity. Prior studies showed that image-to-sound SSDs engage cortices ordinarily specialised for visual functions. However, the brain dynamics of SSD-supported perception remains unknown. Either visual cortices are the first locus of discrimination of SSD percepts, or their activation is a byproduct of perceptual processes unfurling elsewhere, such as in auditory cortices. Resolving this uncertainty is critical for understanding the contribution of visual cortices to mechanisms subserving SSD-induced perceptions in the blind. Using electrical neuroimaging of EEG data from congenitally blind adults, we show for the first time that visual cortices are the earliest site of face and letter sensitivity when conveyed via SSDs, though with distinct temporal dynamics and spatial localizations. In the case of faces versus scrambled faces, differences first manifested at 460ms post-stimulus onset as topographic EEG modulations that were in turn localized to a network of right-hemisphere regions, including the fusiform face area (FFA) as well as lateral occipital cortices. In the case of discerning vertically versus horizontally oriented letter shapes, differences first manifested at 370ms post-stimulus onset as topographic EEG modulations that were localized to a network of left-hemisphere regions, including the occipital pole and the occipito-temporal junction extending into the angular gyrus. Notably, early-latency auditory evoked potentials did not differ based on visual properties of the soundscapes. These collective data support the proposition that responses to soundscapes are routed to brain circuits ordinarily specialized for processing visual information and that these circuits are the loci of the initial discriminant processes. By providing the temporal dynamics of SSD perception, our findings provide unique evidence for the theory that cortices are characterised by task-contingent functional organisation.

eTOC blurbWe characterise for the first time the brain dynamics of the blind using soundscapes for face and letter discrimination. Faces recruited the FFA at 460ms post-stimulus onset, whereas letters recruited the occipital pole, occipito-temporal junction, and angular gyrus at 370ms post-stimulus onset. Our findings of the temporal dynamics of SSD perception uniquely support the theory that cortices are characterised by task-selective sensory-independent functional organisation."
"The neural code remains undiscovered and understanding synaptic input integration under in vivo-like conditions is just the initial step toward unraveling it. Synaptic signals generate fast dendritic spikes through two main modes of temporal summation: coincidence detection and integration. In coincidence detection, dendrites fire only when multiple incoming signals arrive in rapid succession, whereas integration involves summation of postsynaptic potentials over longer periods with minimal membrane leakage. This process is influenced by ionic properties, especially as the membrane potential approaches the firing threshold, where inactivating currents play a critical role. However, the modulation of temporal summation by these currents under in vivo-like conditions has not been thoroughly studied. In our research, we used computer simulations of a single dendritic branch to investigate how three inactivating currents -- A-type potassium, T-type calcium, and transient sodium -- affect temporal summation. We found that calcium and sodium currents promote integrative behavior in dendrites, while potassium currents enhance their ability to act as coincidence detectors. By adjusting the levels of these currents in dendrites, neurons can flexibly switch between integration and coincidence detection modes, providing them with a versatile mechanism for complex tasks like multiplexing. This flexibility could be key to understanding how neural circuits process information in real time.

SignificanceNeurons consist of specialized structures that shape computation. The soma processes inputs from dendrites and communicates via its axon. Dendrites have a branched architecture. They receive excitatory signals and generate dendritic spikes. These spikes allow individual branches to convert inputs into spiking patterns prior to somatic integration. Depending on input synchrony, branches operate as coincidence detectors or integrators, which is determined by ionic currents. Our study explores how these currents affect signal summation. We found that potassium currents favor coincidence detection, while calcium and sodium currents promote integration. Cellular mechanisms finely tune these currents, enabling dendrites to adjust processing modes in response to synaptic inputs."
"Live cell imaging experiments have shown that, although eukaryotic chromosomes are compact, the distal dynamics between enhancers and promoters are unexpectedly rapid and cannot be explained by standard polymer models. The discordance between the compact static chromatin organization (structure) and the relaxation times (dynamics) is a conundrum that violates the expected structure-function relationship. To resolve the puzzle, we developed a theory to predict chromatin dynamics by first calculating the accurate three-dimensional (3D) structure using static Hi-C contact maps or fixed-cell imaging data. The calculated 3D coordinates are used to accurately forecast the two-point dynamics reported in recent experiments that simultaneously monitor chromatin dynamics and transcription. Strikingly, the theory not only predicts the observed fast enhancer-promoter dynamics but also reveals a novel scaling relationship between two-point relaxation time and genomic separation that is in near quantitative agreement with recent experiments. The theory also predicts that cohesin depletion speeds up the dynamics between distal loci. Both the rapid dynamics between distal loci pairs in interphase chromosomes and the acceleration of chromatin loci diffusion upon cohesin depletion are explained in terms of structure-based centrality measure used in graph theory. Our framework shows that chromatin dynamics can be predicted based solely on static experimental data, reinforcing the concept that the three-dimensional structure determines their dynamic behavior. The generality of the theory opens new avenues for exploring chromatin dynamics, especially transcriptional dynamics, across different biological contexts."
"Cranial suture formation is a dynamic process requiring precise cellular and molecular coordination to regulate bone growth and suture homeostasis. Despite the recognized role of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) in this process and its association with Muenke syndrome, one of the most common syndromic craniosynostoses, its precise function remains undefined. Through analyses of cranial suture formation and maintenance in a fgfr3 LoF zebrafish model displaying abnormal suture morphology, we demonstrate for the first time that Fgfr3 plays a pleiotropic role during these events. Transmission electron microscopy and second harmonic generation imaging revealed that Fgfr3 is involved in the proper organization of the collagen network within the suture. By employing specific transgenic reporter lines and studying gene expression of suture mesenchymal stem cell markers via RNAscope in situ hybridization, we show that Fgfr3 is crucial for regulating osteogenesis within the suture. Specifically, Fgfr3 limits the number of osteoprogenitors at the osteogenic front and promotes osteoblast maturation at the suture edge. Finally, our results reveal that Fgfr3-mediated regulation of osteogenesis involves cross-talk between FGF, canonical Wnt, and potentially BMP signaling pathways. In conclusion, these data position Fgfr3 as a central regulator of cranial suture formation and open new perspectives for understanding suture homeostasis and FGFR3-related craniosynostoses."
"A critical step before data-sharing of human neuroimaging is removing facial features to protect individuals privacy. However, not only does this process redact identifiable information about individuals, but it also removes non-identifiable information. This introduces undesired variability into downstream analysis and interpretation. This registered report investigated the degree to which the so-called defacing altered the quality assessment of T1-weighted images of the human brain from the openly available ""IXI dataset"". The effect of defacing on manual quality assessment was investigated on a single-site subset of the dataset (N=185). By comparing two linear mixed-effects models, we determined that four trained human raters perception of quality was significantly influenced by defacing by modeling their ratings on the same set of images in two conditions: ""nondefaced"" (i.e., preserving facial features) and ""defaced"". In addition, we investigated these biases on automated quality assessments by applying repeated-measures, multivariate ANOVA (rm-MANOVA) on the image quality metrics extracted with MRIQC on the full IXI dataset (N=581; three acquisition sites).

This study found that defacing altered the quality assessments by humans and showed that MRIQCs quality metrics were mostly insensitive to defacing."
"Cervical mucus changes throughout the menstrual cycle in response to hormonal fluctuations, regulating access of sperm and pathogens to the reproductive tract. CFTR is an anion channel that plays a critical role in mediating epithelial mucus secretions. Primary endocervical cells obtained from rhesus macaques Macaca mulatta were cultured using conditional reprogramming and treated with vehicle controls or CFTR inhibitors. In order to measure changes in hydration and viscosity of secreted mucus, we adapted two airway mucus assays, airway surface liquid and particle-tracking microrheology, for our endocervical culture system. Endocervical cells treated with CFTR inhibitors demonstrated dehydrated, thicker mucus secretions compared to controls in both assay outputs. Our studies suggest that CFTR may be an important mediator of fertility changes and provide experimental evidence for the infertility phenotype seen in women with cystic fibrosis. Additionally, assays developed in these studies provide new endpoints for assessing cervical mucus changes in vitro.

Summary SentenceInhibition of CFTR, a key epithelial ion channel in primary endocervical cells leads to dehydrated, thickened mucus production in vitro"
"MotivationThe combination of long-read sequencing technologies like Oxford Nanopore with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) assays enables the detailed exploration of transcriptomic complexity, including isoform detection and quantification, by capturing full-length cDNAs. However, challenges remain, including the lack of advanced simulation tools that can effectively mimic the unique complexities of scRNAseq long-read datasets. Such tools are essential for the evaluation and optimization of isoform detection methods dedicated to single-cell long read studies.

ResultsWe developed AsaruSim, a workflow that simulates synthetic single-cell long-read Nanopore datasets, closely mimicking real experimental data. AsaruSim employs a multi-step process that includes the creation of a synthetic UMI count matrix, generation of perfect reads, optional PCR amplification, introduction of sequencing errors, and comprehensive quality control reporting. Applied to a dataset of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), AsaruSim accurately reproduced experimental read characteristics.

"Genome editing has the potential to treat genetic disorders at the source. This can be achieved by modifying the defective DNA through the intentional insertion, deletion, or substitution of genomic content. Among all genome editing technologies, CRISPR/Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR-associated protein) is considered the gold standard. CRISPR/Cas uses a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to direct the Cas nuclease to a target DNA region. Due to the ease at creating small RNA molecules, it is possible to have the CRISPR/Cas complex target any arbitrary DNA sequence, thus making it a versatile tool. The efficacy of the complex is dependent on the ability of the sgRNA to bind to a complementary DNA sequence, which varies based on the sequence. Thus, a major challenge is finding sgRNA sequences that have good efficacy. This is where computational models can aid scientists: by predicting the activity of sgRNAs to help narrow the search space of finding the optimal sgRNA. We have used a large new dataset to build and compare the ability of several different machine learning architectures ability to predict on-target CRISPR/Cas activity. Additionally, we explored how adding GC content affects our sgRNA activity predictions. Our novel hybrid model, ChromeCRISPR, combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, has outperformed state-of-the-art models, including DeepHF and AttCrispr, establishing a new benchmark for predictive accuracy in CRISPR/Cas9 efficacy predictions."
"Elucidating the rules that govern community assembly and enable the coexistence of species is central to ecology. Much of the current understanding revolves around the composition of communities at equilibrium. In contrast, transient ecological dynamics, in particular the succession of species following an environmental disturbance, remain largely unexplored. We present Gymnogaster buphthalma beetle carcasses as a model to study species coexistence in disequilibrium. In this community, nematodes appear in succession - with multiple feeding and reproductive strategies, transience, and associated dispersal - creating a perfect model for metacommunity ecology. We computationally reconstructed decaying G. buphthalma beetles sampled from the wild using experimentally-derived life history data, i.e. emergence times, sex ratios, and fecundity measurements. Through agent-based modeling, we show that nematode coexistence is possible over a wide range of scenarios. This work provides a unique experimental and computational framework to synthesize various approaches to metacommunity and species succession theories."
"Stomatal opening is crucial for gas exchange, but it unavoidably offers invasion by pathogens. In response, plants close stomata to prevent pathogen entry, while the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pto) produces coronatine (COR), a jasmonate (JA) mimic, to counteract this plant response. Here, we demonstrate that by COR, Pto exploits CYP707A1 activation in Arabidopsis thaliana, encoding an enzyme that degrades abscisic acid, essential for stomatal closure. Notably, COR-induction of CYP707A1 is absent in other Brassicaceae species, such as Capsella rubella and Eutrema salsugineum, rendering them resistant to Pto invasion. In contrast, in A. thaliana, CYP707A1 enables rapid stomatal opening at dawn in a JA-dependent manner, enhancing gas exchange and chlorophyll content, unlike C. rubella and E. salsugineum. Promoter-swap experiments confirm that the regulatory region of CYP707A1 underlies these evolutionary diversifications. Together, our study presents a mechanism underlying an evolutionary trade-off between stomatal defense and gas exchange."
"Large serine integrases (LSIs) catalyze unidirectional site-specific DNA recombination reactions, yet those reactions are reversed by the presence of a cognate recombination directionality factor (RDF). Mechanistic understanding of directionality control has been hampered by a lack of structural information. Here, we use cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) to determine the structures of six SPbeta integrase-DNA complexes along the integrative (-RDF) and excisive (+RDF) reaction pathways, at 4.16-7.18[A] resolution. Our findings reveal how RDF-mediated repositioning of an integrase subdomain (1) dictates which pairs of DNA sites can be assembled into a synaptic complex to initiate recombination and (2) dictates which product complexes will be conformationally locked, preventing the back reaction. These mechanistic insights provide a conceptual framework for engineering efficient and versatile genome editing tools."
"Macrophages comprise a significant portion of the glioblastoma tumor microenvironment and are essential in promoting immunosuppression and tumor progression. Solid tumors such as glioblastoma generate solid stress as they expand, creating a compressive microenvironment for mechanosensitive immune cells including macrophages. Macrophages are known to respond to various mechanical stimuli but have not yet been studied in the context of chronic compression observed in growing tumors. Here, we used a custom in vitro compression system to elucidate the effects of compressive solid stress on murine macrophages. We found that macrophages have significant morphological, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional responses to compression. These changes corresponded to both canonical pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophage states. The gene expression signatures of compressed macrophages more closely resembled those of glioma-associated macrophages known to be associated with worse patient outcomes. These results indicate that compression alone, independent from tumor cell-derived biochemical factors, may contribute to the pathological tumor-associated macrophage phenotype. This could represent a vicious cycle of tumor immunomechanics and mechano-immunology. Targeting solid stress in tumors or the response to solid stress by macrophages may interrupt this feedback loop to help normalize the tumor immune microenvironment and improve glioblastoma response to immunotherapy."
"Mammalian genomes are pervasively transcribed into long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), whose functions and modes of action remain poorly understood. EPB41L4A-AS1 is an evolutionary conserved, broadly and highly expressed lncRNA that produces the H/ACA snoRNA SNORA13 from one of its introns. We studied the consequences of EPB41L4A-AS1 perturbation in breast cancer cells and found that it acts both in cis, to enhance transcription of the proximal EPB41L4A gene and additional genes in its two flanking topologically associated domains, and in trans by broadly regulating gene expression, including expression of snoRNAs, transcription of genes involved in nucleolar biology and the distribution of nucleolar proteins. These effects are phenocopied by the loss of SUB1, an interactor of EPB41L4A-AS1, and are observed following transient perturbations of EPB41L4A-AS1 that do not affect steady-state SNORA13 levels or the rRNA modification it helps install. Exogenous expression of the full-length EPB41L4A-AS1 locus but not SNORA13 expression can rescue the trans-acting transcriptional effects of its perturbation. The EPB41L4A-AS1 gene is thus a versatile locus producing RNA molecules acting on multiple levels for key cellular functions."
"In industrial biotechnology, cell density is a critical parameter that influences key process control variables such as feed rate, harvest timing, and product recovery. Traditional biomass measurements are indirect, incapable of quantifying population heterogeneity, and often prone to inaccuracies due to manual handling and interference from culture media compounds. This study introduces an automated flow cytometry approach to enable continuous, real-time monitoring of bacterial cultures in a continuous bioreactor. Our method employs a double-staining protocol that combines DAPI for assessing total DNA content with Alexa Fluor 488 via Click-iT technology to detect the percentage of cells with active DNA replication through EdU incorporation. This streamlined protocol, which integrates cell fixation, permeabilization, staining, and measurement, was applied to three Gram-negative strains: Bradyrhizobium sp., Escherichia coli, and Stenotrophomonas rhizophila. The approach successfully captured both growth dynamics and cell cycle progression, providing rapid and quantitative insights into culture composition. The enhanced temporal resolution achieved by this method facilitates timely adjustments of process parameters, ultimately improving bioprocess efficiency and product quality. These results underscore the potential of automated flow cytometry as a powerful tool for real-time monitoring and control in industrial biotechnology."
"Physical activity (PA) is a fundamental aspect of preventive medicine, offering profound benefits for cardiovascular health and overall well-being. Despite its widespread benefits, the molecular mechanisms underlying PA-induced improvements in microvascular functions remain poorly understood. The skin microvasculature is uniquely affected by exercise-induced shear stress, especially during thermoregulation. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigated how voluntary exercise influences the transcription profile of endothelial cells in the skin microvasculature of mice. We assigned 20 mice to either a sedentary group or a 1-month voluntary exercise program involving running wheels. Post-intervention, we collected skin biopsies from twelve mice for transcriptomic analyses. The differential expression analysis showed a significant increase in the expression of the Zbtb16 gene in vascular endothelial cells (vECs). Additionally, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) with nominally differentially expressed genes in vECs highlighted the suppression of pathways related to oxidative stress, cell proliferation and metabolism in the exercise group. This suggests an exercise-triggered transition towards improved metabolic efficiency and enhanced homeostasis in vECs. These results begin to reveal how exercise induces molecular changes in vECs of the skin microvasculature, highlighting the role of PA in influencing endothelial function."
"This paper presents the first scientific investigation of the corky bark of Eucalyptus suberea (cork mallee). The study involved outer bark samples from two trees with diameters of 23 cm (A) and 47 cm (B), collected from a plantation in Portugal. Anatomical analysis was performed using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), enabling detailed observation of bark to reveal the cork cells presence. The chemical characterization included summative chemical analysis, FTIR, and GC-MS/FID for suberin composition and Py-GC-MS for lignin composition. The extractive-free bark mass of E. suberea from trees A and B contained 29% and 25% suberin, 30% and 37% lignin, and 39% and 38% polysaccharides, respectively. The bark A exhibited a higher extractives content (49%) than just 14% for bark B. Conversely, dichloromethane extract from bark A was notably rich in alkanol ferulates. FTIR spectra revealed a characteristic cork tissue pattern, showing a low suberin content but high levels of polysaccharides and free carboxylic acids. The main components of E. suberea A and B suberins were glycerol, with 15% and 11%, {omega}-hydroxyacids, with 45% and 50%, and ,{omega}-diacids, with 30% and 17%, representing a total of ca. 90% and 78% of E. suberea A and B suberins mass, respectively. Both suberins showed low contents of epoxides and vic-diols; also, both presented the particularity of having high contents of free acid groups, especially the suberin of bark B, suggesting a structure with short aliphatic chains. E. suberea corky bark presents a lignin composition that differentiates from the cork G-lignins analyzed until now with a monomer composition exhibiting a GS character, with more G- (53-56%) than S-units (34-37%) with an S/G ratio between 0.64 to 0.66, for A and B lignins, respectively."
"Evolutionary algorithms, a class of optimization techniques inspired by biological evolution, have emerged as powerful tools for the optimization of complex systems, including the evolution of mass-action chemical reaction networks. This work explores the application of evolutionary algorithms in this domain, presenting a novel approach inspired by neural network evolution methodologies. A key feature of the algorithm is speciation, which separates candidate reaction networks into groups based on their similarity, which maintains diversity and protects innovations. Crossover has also been shown to be an effective means of improving evolutionary success in other domains. However, crossover of mass-action networks is tested and found to be detrimental to the evolutionary process. This work goes beyond theoretical exploration by offering a practical contribution in the form of a user-friendly software module. This module encapsulates the newly devised algorithm, enabling researchers and practitioners to readily apply the speciation-based approach in their own investigations of mass-action chemical reaction networks.

Author summaryEvolutionary algorithms are an optimization technique inspired by biological evolution. They can be used to solve complex multi-dimensional problems for which analytic solutions are infeasible. We developed a novel evolutionary algorithm for use with mass-action chemical reaction networks. This algorithm implements two features of biological evolution, speciation and crossover, in an effort to generate chemical reaction networks with specific behaviors. Here, this novel algorithm is demonstrated by generating chemical reaction networks whose chemical species oscillate in time. This algorithm is encapsulated in a julia package and is publicly available as ReactionNetworkEvolution.jl."
"How the brain constructs meaning from individual words and phrases is a fundamental question for research in semantic cognition, language and their disorders. These two aspects of meaning are traditionally studied separately, resulting in two large, multi-method literatures, which we sought to bring together in this study. Not only would this address basic cognitive questions of how semantic cognition operates but also because, despite their distinct focuses, both literatures ascribe a critical role to the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in each aspect of semantics. Given these considerations, we explored the notion that these systems rely on common underlying computational principles when activating conceptual semantic representations via single words, vs. building a coherent semantic representation across sequences of words. The present study used magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography to track brain activity in participants reading nouns and adjective-noun phrases, whilst integrating conceptual variables from both literatures: the concreteness of nouns (e.g., ""lettuce"" vs. ""fiction"") and the denotational semantics of adjectives (subsective vs. privative; e.g., ""bad"" vs. ""fake""). Region-of-interest analyses show that the left, and to a lesser extent the right, ATLs responded more strongly to phrases at different timepoints, irrespective of concreteness, suggesting a unified ATL function for semantic memory and composition. Decoding analyses further revealed a time-varying representational format for adjective semantics, whereas representations of noun concreteness were more stable and maintained for around 300 ms. Further, the neural representation of noun concreteness was modulated by the preceding adjectives: decoders learning concreteness signals in single words generalized better to subsective relative to privative phrases."
"Recent clinical trial data have shown that cell therapy holds curative potential for type-I diabetes. The required cell differentiation process exhibits substantial variability, even among clones of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). We apply an EfficientNet-V2-S model to obtain a novel early prediction for the outcome of the differentiation process from patient-derived iPSC to {beta}-cells using only phase-contrast images. In contrast to many established data sets in medical imaging, human experts struggle to predict the ground truth in this type of images. Therefore, to gain critical insight into the learned features, we applied layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), and Fourier-based frequency analysis. LRP analysis shows that the negative class contains more hole-like regions between cells. We show that the model learns features related to patch variance, and that patch-normalization improves patch accuracies for times after cell washing with less cell debris.

"Pathogen recognition by the immune system relies on germline-encoded pathogen recognition receptors which identify conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as the lipid A section of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The assumption that pathogens and mammalian-associated bacteria remodel their lipid A PAMP because of host-microbe co-evolution is a long held-belief of microbial pathogenesis. We set out to test this fundamental principle by interrogating a Gram-negative genus presenting evidence of evolutionary events linked to the acquisition of essential virulence traits, resulting in pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. The genus Yersinia fulfil these requirements; the acquisition of the pYV virulence plasmid is one of the evolutionary events associated with virulence. At 37{degrees}C, only pathogenic Yersinia switch to deacylated lipid A, a modification that diminishes TLR4/MD-2 recognition and reduces inflammation. An engineered chimeric pathogenic Yersinia strain expressing the non-pathogenic lipid A profile efficiently engages with TLR4, demonstrating it is sufficient to switch the acylation pattern to modify the recognition by TLR4 and subsequent activation of inflammation. The lipid As of pathogenic and non-pathogenic species are modified with aminoarabinose and palmitate; therefore, only the reduced acylation of the lipid A PAMP is a trait associated with virulence. The decorations of lipid A do not alter TLR4 engagement but confer resistance to antimicrobial peptides. The chimeric pathogenic Yersinia strain expressing the non-pathogenic lipid A profile allows to ascertain whether the switch in the lipid A PAMP affects virulence. This strain showed enhanced motility due to an upregulation of the flhDC master regulator, and impaired cellular invasion through downregulation of rovA, a key invasion regulator. The expression and function of pYV-encoded virulence factors Yops and YadA were not affected. Nonetheless, the chimeric strain was attenuated in vivo, demonstrating that virulence factors cannot overcome a switch in the lipid A PAMP associated with pathogenicity."
"Crosslinked cytoskeletal filament networks provide cells with a mechanism to regulate cellular mechanics and force transmission. An example in the microtubule cytoskeleton is mitotic spindle elongation. The three-dimensional geometry of these networks, including the overlap length and lateral microtubule spacing, likely controls how forces can be regulated, but how these parameters evolve during filament sliding is unknown. Recent evidence suggests that the crosslinker PRC1 can resist microtubule sliding by two distinct modes: a braking mode and a less resistive coasting mode. To explore how molecular-scale mechanisms influence network geometry in this system, we developed a computational model of sliding microtubule pairs crosslinked by PRC1 that reproduces the experimentally observed braking and coasting modes. Surprisingly, we found that the braking mode was associated with a substantially smaller lateral separation between the crosslinked microtubules than the coasting mode. This closer separation aligns the PRC1-mediated forces against sliding, increasing the resistive PRC1 force and dramatically reducing sliding speed. The model also finds an emergent similar average sliding speed due to PRC1 resistance, because higher initial sliding speed favors the transition to braking. Together, our results highlight the importance of the three-dimensional geometric relationships between crosslinkers and microtubules."
"Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive bacterium and opportunistic pathogen that acquires resistance to a wide range of antibiotics by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The rapid increase of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria including MDR E. faecalis necessitates the development of alternative therapies and a deeper understanding of the factors that impact HGT. CRISPR-Cas systems provide sequence-specific defense against HGT. From previous studies, we know that E. faecalis CRISPR-Cas provides sequence-specific anti-plasmid defense during agar plate biofilm mating and in the murine intestine. Those studies were mainly conducted using laboratory model strains with a single, CRISPR-targeted plasmid in the donor. MDR E. faecalis typically possess multiple plasmids that are diverse in sequence and may interact with each other to impact plasmid transfer and CRISPR-Cas efficacy. Here, we altered multiple parameters of our standard in vitro conjugation assays to assess CRISPR-Cas efficacy, including the number and genotype of plasmids in the donor; laboratory model strains as donor versus recent human isolates as donor; and the biofilm substrate utilized during conjugation. We found that the plasmids pTEF2 and pCF10, which are not targeted by CRISPR-Cas in our recipient, enhance the conjugative transfer of the CRISPR-targeted plasmid pTEF1 into both wild-type and CRISPR-Cas-deficient (via deletion of cas9) recipient cells. However, the effect of pTEF2 on pTEF1 transfer is much more pronounced, with a striking 6-log increase in pTEF1 conjugation frequency when pTEF2 is also present in the donor and recipients are deficient for CRISPR-Cas (compared to 4-log for pCF10). We also identified that E. faecalis {Delta}cas9 has altered biofilm structure and thickness relative to the wild-type strain when cultured on a plastic substrate, but equivalent growth in the agar plate biofilms widely used for conjugation studies. Overall, this study provides insight about the interplay between plasmids and CRISPR-Cas defense, opening avenues for developing novel therapeutic strategies to curb HGT among bacterial pathogens, and highlighting pTEF2 as a plasmid for additional mechanistic study.

IMPORTANCEThe emergence of MDR bacteria, including MDR E. faecalis, limits treatment options and necessitates development of alternative therapeutics. In these circumstances, bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems are being explored by the field to develop CRISPR-based antimicrobials. However, in many cases CRISPR-Cas efficacy has only been assessed using laboratory model strains. More studies are required that investigate clinical isolates, as those are the intended targets for CRISPR antimicrobials. Here, we demonstrated how the number of plasmids harbored by an E. faecalis donor strain can affect the apparent efficacy of CRISPR-Cas anti-plasmid defense in a recipient strain. Overall, our research is important to develop improved CRISPR-based antimicrobials to combat the spread and accumulation of antibiotic resistance determinants."
"We have developed the HybriSeq method for single-cell RNA profiling, which utilizes in situ hybridization of multiple probes for targeted transcripts, followed by split-pool barcoding and sequencing analysis of the probes. We have shown that HybriSeq can achieve high sensitivity for RNA detection with multiple probes and profile entire transcripts without an end bias. The utility of HybriSeq is demonstrated in characterizing cell-to-cell heterogeneities of a panel of 196 genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the detection of missed annotations of transcripts."
"Circuit function results from both intrinsic conductances of network neurons and the synaptic conductances that connect them. In models of neural circuits, different combinations of maximal conductances can give rise to similar activity. We compared the robustness of a neural circuit to changes in their intrinsic versus synaptic conductances. To address this, we performed a sensitivity analysis on a population of conductance-based models of the pyloric network from the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG). The model network consists of three neurons with nine currents: a sodium current (Na), three potassium currents (Kd, KCa, A-type), two calcium currents (CaS and CaT), a hyperpolarization-activated current (H), a non-voltage-gated leak current (leak), and a neuromodulatory current (MI). The model cells are connected by seven synapses of two types, glutamatergic and cholinergic. We produced one hundred models of the pyloric network that displayed similar activities with values of maximal conductances distributed over wide ranges. We evaluated the robustness of each model to changes in their maximal conductances. We found that individual models have different sensitivities to changes in their maximal conductances, both in their intrinsic and synaptic conductances. As expected the models become less robust as the extent of the changes increase. Despite quantitative differences in their robustness, we found that in all cases, the model networks are more sensitive to the perturbation of their intrinsic conductances than their synaptic conductances."
"In 2015, we published the complete genome assembly of Sporisorium scitamineum, the fungal pathogen responsible for sugarcane smut disease, generated from PacBio long-read sequencing and polished with Illumina short reads. Since then, the tools for genome assembly have improved considerably, including advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics workflows, motivating us to revisit our original assembly. Here, we present an updated genome version, using newly generated high-quality Illumina short-read data and DeepVariant-based polishing, resulting in corrections at approximately 5,500 genomic positions. BUSCO benchmarking in protein mode demonstrated increased genome completeness from the original 94.2% to 99.3%, indicating substantial improvements in both accuracy and gene annotation reliability. Additionally, comparison with publicly available assemblies reveals that most sequence polymorphisms occur in isolates belonging to the Asian lineage, consistent with earlier population-level studies. This enhanced genome assembly provides a significantly improved reference resource, enabling more robust genetic, evolutionary, and functional studies of this economically important sugarcane pathogen."
"Establishing the anterior-posterior body axis is a fundamental process during embryogenesis, and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, provides one of the best-known case studies of this process. In Drosophila, localized mRNA of bicoid serves as anterior determinant (AD). Bicoid engages in a concentration-dependent competition with nucleosomes and initiates symmetry-breaking along the AP axis by promoting chromatin accessibility at the loci of transcription factor (TF) genes that are expressed in the anterior of the embryo. However, ADs of other fly species are unrelated and structurally distinct, and little is known about how they function. We addressed this question in the moth fly, Clogmia albipunctata, in which a maternally expressed transcript isoform of the pair-rule segmentation gene odd-paired is localized in the anterior egg and has been co-opted as AD. We provide a de novo assembly and annotation of the Clogmia genome and describe how knockdown of zelda and maternal odd-paired transcript affect chromatin accessibility and expression of TF-encoding loci. The results of these experiments suggest direct roles of Cal-Zld in opening and closing chromatin during nuclear cleavage cycles and show that Clogmias maternal odd-paired activity promotes chromatin accessibility and anterior expression during the early phase of zygotic genome activation at Clogmias homeobrain and sloppy-paired loci. We conclude that unrelated dipteran ADs initiate anterior-posterior axis-specification at the level of enhancer accessibility and that homeobrain and sloppy-paired homologs may serve a more widely conserved role in the initiation of anterior pattern formation given their early anterior expression and function in head development in other insects."
"A longstanding barrier in genome engineering with CRISPR-Cas9 has been the inability to measure Cas9 edit outcomes and their functional effects at single-cell resolution. Here we present Superb-seq, a new technology that leverages T7 in situ transcription and single-cell RNA sequencing to jointly measure on- and off-target Cas9 edits and their effects on gene expression. We performed Superb-seq on 10,000 K562 cells, targeting four chromatin remodeler genes with seven guide RNAs. Superb-seq identified 11,891 edit events in 6,230 edited cells at all seven on-target sites and at an additional 36 off-target sites. Although the seven guides were selected for high specificity, six of them caused off-target edits, ranging in frequency from 0.03% to 18.6% of cells. A notable off-target edit within the first intron of USP9X disrupted the expression of this gene and over 150 downstream genes. In summary, Cas9 off-targeting is pervasive due to a combination of rare and common edit events, occurs primarily within introns of off-target genes, and can exert widespread effects on gene expression. Superb-seq uses off-the-shelf kits, standard equipment, and requires no virus, which will enable genome-wide CRISPR screens in diverse cell types as well as functional characterization of clinically-relevant guides."
"PurposeLittle is known about sialic acids of the human retina, despite their integral role in self/non-self-discrimination by complement factor H (CFH), the alternative complement pathway inhibitor.

MethodsA custom sialoglycan microarray was used to characterize the sialic acid-binding specificity of native CFH or recombinant molecules where IgG Fc was fused to CFH domains 16-20 (contains a sialic acid-binding site), domains 6-7 (contains a glycosaminoglycan-binding site) or the CFH-related proteins (CFHRs) 1 and 3. We analyzed macular and peripheral retinal tissue from post-mortem ocular globes for amount, type, and presentation (glycosidic linkage type) of sialic acid in individuals with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and age-matched controls using fluorescent lectins and antibodies to detect sialic acid and endogenous CFH. Released sialic acids from neural retina, retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) cells and the Bruchs membrane (BrM) were labelled with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene-2HCl (DMB), separated and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (DMB-HPLC).

ResultsBoth native CFH and the recombinant CFH domains 16-20 recognized Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc that is 2-3-linked to the underlying galactose. 4-O-Actylation of sialic acid and sulfation of GlcNAc did not inhibit binding. Different linkage types of sialic acid were localized at different layers of the retina. The greatest density of 2-3-sialic acid, which is the preferred ligand of CFH, did not colocalize with endogenous CFH. The level of sialic acids at the BrM/choroid interface of macula and peripheral retina of individuals with AMD were significantly reduced.

ConclusionsThe sialome of the human retina is altered in AMD. This can affect CFH binding and consequently, alternative complement pathway regulation."
"IRE1 and its downstream XBP1 signal is the most conserved unfolded protein response pathway that cells utilize to combat endoplasmic reticulum stress, also known to be utilized by tumor cells to adapt to harsh environment, leading to tumor progression. Several inhibitors against IRE1 have been developed, some of which show promising effect in clinical trial for cancer therapy, but none of them have been used in practice. Considering that hyper-activation of IRE1 induces cell death, we hypothesize that activation of IRE1 could be an alternative way for tumor suppression. Here, we identified divalent manganese ion as a potent activator to IRE1, which interacts with the cytosolic part of IRE1 directly, augmenting the downstream pro-apoptotic pathway but not the pro-survival outcome. Mn2+ limits tumor growth in xenograft model in an IRE1-dependent way. Our finding suggests pharmacological activation of IRE1 as an underestimated but promising way in cancer therapy.

HighlightsO_LIMn2+ binds to cytosolic segment of IRE1 and promotes its oligomerization
C_LIO_LIMn2+ hyper-activates IRE1 and induces downstream terminal UPR under ER stress
C_LIO_LIMn2+ does not elevate XBP1s expression

"Lactobacilli are prevalent members of the intestinal and reproductive tract microbiota of humans and other species. They are commonly used in probiotics and various food products due to their beneficial effects on human health. For example, these beneficial microbes are used to treat diarrhea caused by antibiotic therapy and are commonly given during antibiotic treatment. Despite the many studies conducted to understand the beneficial effects of Lactobacilli, less is known about their resistance and heteroresistance to antibiotics. In this study, we evaluated the resistance heterogeneity in eight Lactobacillus species. Our results demonstrate that several Lactobacilli species, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, are heteroresistant to antibiotics, a recently discovered phenotype commonly seen in multidrug-resistant organisms that cause clinical failures but understudied in commensals and probiotics."
"Flexible behaviour requires decision-making that integrates both perceptual and mnemonic-related information. While the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) is known to support decision-making based on perceptual computations, its contributions to decisions based on mnemonic information for motor planning are underexplored. Here, investigating local field potential (LFP) oscillations in PMd of monkeys performing a transitive inference task required the formation and retrieval of mnemonic representations of an arbitrarily defined rank order among perceptual items. Our results highlight that a dynamic interplay between lower frequencies (Theta, Alpha, Beta) and high-Gamma oscillatory activity of LFP reflects a mechanism for accessing and manipulating memory-related information underlying decision-making. These findings provide evidence that the PMd plays a role in multiplexing both perceptual and mnemonic information, extending its competence beyond the association of perceptual input with motor decisions."
"Individuals who have experienced a left hemisphere cerebrovascular accident (LCVA) have been shown to make errors in naturalistic action tasks designed to assess the ability to perform everyday activities such as preparing a cup of coffee. Naturalistic action errors in this population are often attributed to limb apraxia, a common deficit in the representation and performance of object-related actions. However, naturalistic action impairments are also observed in right hemisphere stroke and traumatic brain injury, populations infrequently associated with apraxia, and errors across all these populations are influenced by overall severity. Based on these and other data, an alternative (though not mutually exclusive) account is that naturalistic action errors in individuals with LCVA are also a consequence of deficits in general attentional resource availability or allocation. In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of data from a group of 51 individuals with LCVA who had completed a test of naturalistic action, along with a battery of tests assessing praxis, attention allocation and control, reasoning, and language abilities to determine which of these capacities contribute uniquely to naturalistic action impairments. Using a regularized regression method, we found that naturalistic action impairments are predicted by both praxis deficits (hand posture sequencing and gesture recognition), as well as attention allocation and control deficits (orienting and dividing attention), along with language comprehension ability and age. Using support vector regression-lesion symptom mapping, we demonstrated that naturalistic action impairments are associated with lesions to posterior middle temporal gyrus and anterior inferior parietal lobule regions known to be implicated in praxis; as well the middle frontal gyrus that has been implicated in both praxis and attention allocation and control. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that naturalistic action impairments in people with LCVA are a consequence of apraxia as well as deficits in attention allocation and control."
"Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA molecules that enable horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, often conferring advantages such as antibiotic resistance. Despite their significance, plasmids are underrepresented in genomic databases due to challenges in assembling them, caused by mosaicism and micro-diversity. Current plasmid assemblers rely on detecting circular paths in single-sample assembly graphs, but face limitations due to graph fragmentation and entanglement, and low coverage. We introduce PlasMAAG (Plasmid and organism Metagenomic binning using Assembly Alignment Graphs), a framework to recover plasmids and organisms from metagenomic samples that leverages an approach that we call ""assembly-alignment graphs"" alongside common binning features. On synthetic benchmark datasets, PlasMAAG reconstructed 50-121% more near-complete plasmids than competing methods and improved the Matthews Correlation Coefficient of geNomad contig classification by 28-106%. On hospital sewage samples, PlasMAAG outperformed all other methods, reconstructing 33% more plasmid sequences. PlasMAAG enables the study of organism-plasmid associations and intra-plasmid diversity across samples, offering state-of-the-art plasmid reconstruction with reduced computational costs."
"Protein condensation is the basis for formation of membrane-less organelles in the cell. Most famously, weak, polyvalent interactions, often including RNA, may lead to a liquid-liquid phase separation. This effect greatly enhances local concentrations and is thought to promote interactions that would remain rare in dilute solution. Synthetic systems provide a means to clarify the underlying biophysical mechanisms at play, both in vitro and in the cell via exogenous expression. In this regard, ferritin is a useful substrate, as its composition of 24 subunits with octahedral symmetry supports self-assembly by close packing in 3D. The conventional diagnostic tool for protein condensation is fluorescence imaging. In this work we explore the use of refractive index mapping to detect states of condensation and decondensation. Using two related ferritin-based self-assembly systems, we find that refractive index is a sensitive indicator for reversible condensation. Surprisingly, refractive index indicates a rapid decondensation even when molecular dispersal kinetics are slow according to fluorescence. Conversely, in a photo-activated condensation where long activation results in slow decondensation kinetics, the refractive index provides reliable evidence for the physical state independent of fluorescence. The observations suggest a distinction between condensation to a sparse biomolecular network, or to a material continuum that supports an optical polarizability distinct from that of the dilute phase in solution."
"Marginal zone (MZ) B cells are considered to be innate-like immune cells, and follicular (FO) B cells are considered to be adaptive immune B cells. Yet, the proliferative response of MZ and FO B cells to different innate stimuli remains unclear. Here, we investigated cell growth, division, and death to determine the collective proliferative response of MZ and FO B cells in response to innate stimuli, LPS and CpG. We show that the growth rate of FO B cells is higher than that of MZ B cells in response to CpG, though MZ B cells acquire a higher mass at division, whereas both the growth rate and mass at division for MZ and FO B cells remain similar in response to LPS stimulation. We show that MZ B cells divide faster and induce a higher cRel expression in response to both CpG and LPS stimulation than FO B cells. A higher proportion of MZ B cells enter first division in response to LPS stimulation, not in response to CpG stimulation, than FO B cells. Interestingly, CpG stimulation, not LPS stimulation, leads to higher cell death in MZ B cells than FO B cells. In response to LPS stimulation, MZ B cells show a higher cell number at early time and a reduced/ similar cell number at late time, whereas in response to CpG stimulation, MZ B cells show a lower cell number at both early and late time. Our study suggests that LPS and CpG stimulation impact cell growth, division, and death differently, which in turn regulate different proliferative responses of MZ and FO B cells. Thus, our study offers a new perspective that different innate stimuli regulate different features of proliferative responses."
"Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles primarily carry PD-L1 via exosomes, which interact with PD-1 receptors on T cells, impacting immune responses in the tumor microenvironment and beyond, leading to a more extensive immunosuppressive landscape. However, the mechanisms governing exosomal PD-L1 sorting and secretion remain elusive. In this study, we identified Munc13-4 as a crucial regulator of exosomal PD-L1 sorting and secretion. Deletion of Munc13-4 in breast tumors enhances T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity, suppresses tumor growth, and improves the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our results illustrate how Munc13-4 collaborates with HRS, Rab27, and SNAREs to facilitate PD-L1 sorting and secretion via exosomes. The cryo-EM structure of the Munc13-4-Rab27a complex provide new insights into its role in exosome secretion. Importantly, we discovered that Munc13-4 has a novel role in sorting PD-L1 onto exosomes, which relies on the formation of a ternary complex with PD-L1 and HRS. In addition, IFN{gamma} stimulation modifies Munc13-4 and HRS, establishing a dynamic regulatory mechanism that enables tumor cells to adapt to immune pressure by modulating PD-L1 sorting. Using a specially designed peptide to disrupt the Munc13-4-PD-L1 interaction and impede PD-L1 sorting significantly enhances anti-tumor immunity and slows tumor growth in vivo. These results highlight the potential of targeting the Munc13-4-PD-L1 axis to suppress tumor immune evasion."
"IntroductionSleep deprivation, also known as ""wake therapy"", has long been recognized as a powerful antidepressant. Phase-targeted auditory stimulation (PTAS) has been suggested as an auspicious non-invasive nocturnal substitute for sleep deprivation. Down-PTAS with stimuli presentation during the down-phase of slow waves, in particular, may have therapeutic potential to improve mood by selectively reducing slow-wave activity (SWA). With down-PTAS being more nuanced than sleep deprivation, its effects presumably develop over multiple nights, thus necessitating transfer from sleep laboratory to home settings. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the technical feasibility, tolerability, and potential risks associated with a wearable device employed for down-PTAS in an unsupervised home setting.

MethodsWe recorded frontal EEG using the MHSL Sleepband Version 3 (MHSL-SB) in five healthy participants (23.8 {+/-} 0.8 years, three women) over seven consecutive nights with (STIM) and without (SHAM) tone application at their homes. Tones were delivered shortly before the negative peak of slow waves during N2/N3 sleep, using alternating 10-s ON-OFF windows. Sleep staging followed American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines. Of the 67 available sleep recordings, we excluded three due to parameter adjustments and another six for technical issues, leaving 58 sleep recordings (29 SHAM, 29 STIM) for further analyses. Low SWA (0.5-2 Hz, lSWA) was computed across the entire night, ON-OFF windows, and sleep cycles. Time-frequency analyses were performed time-locked to stimulus onset. We computed linear mixed effect models with condition (STIM vs. SHAM) as a fixed effect and random participant intercepts.

ResultsData quality was sufficient for analyses in 87% of the available sleep recordings, with an average of over 1500 correctly delivered stimuli per recording. Down-PTAS did not affect sleep architecture, but it reduced lSWA primarily during the first sleep cycle when sleep pressure and lSWA were highest, and particularly in OFF windows. Additionally, stimulation elicited a K-complex-like auditory evoked response, aligning with previous laboratory findings.

ConclusionOur results demonstrate the successful implementation of down-PTAS in a home setting, confirming its feasibility for long-term, unsupervised use. The K-complex-like auditory evoked response may mask potential reductions in lSWA during ON windows, posing a scientific analytical challenge. Taken together, future clinical research should now assess the effects of down-PTAS in depressed patients, in whom reducing lSWA may partly mimic sleep deprivation."
"The standard of care in high-grade gliomas has remained unchanged in the past 20 years. Efforts to replicate effective immunotherapies in non-cranial tumors have led to only modest therapeutical improvements in glioblastoma (GB).

Here, we demonstrate that intratumoral administration of recombinant interleukin-12 (rIL-12) promotes local cytotoxic CD8POS T cell accumulation and conversion into an effector-like state, resulting in a dose-dependent survival benefit in preclinical GB mouse models. This tumor-reactive CD8 T cell response is further supported by intratumoral rIL-12-sensing dendritic cells (DCs) and is accompanied by the co-stimulatory receptor 4-1BB expression on both cell types. Given that DCs and CD8POS T cells are functionally suppressed in the tumor microenvironments of de novo and recurrent glioma patients, we tested whether anti-tumor response at the rIL-12-inflamed tumor site could be enhanced with 4-1BBL, the ligand of 4-1BB. 4-1BBL was delivered using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector targeting GFAP-expressing cells and resulted in prolonged survival of rIL-12 treated GB-bearing mice.

This study establishes that tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cell activity can be directed using an AAV-vector-mediated gene therapy approach, effectively enhancing anti-GB immunity."
"Plant functional traits are fundamental to ecosystem dynamics and Earth system processes, but their global characterization is limited by the availability of field surveys and trait measurements. Recent expansions in biodiversity data aggregation, including large collections of vegetation surveys, citizen science observations, and trait measurements, offer new opportunities to overcome these constraints. Here we demonstrate that combining these diverse data sources with high-resolution Earth observation data enables accurate modeling of key plant traits at up to 1 km resolution. Our approach achieves high predictive power, reaching correlations up to 0.63 (15 of 31 traits exceeding 0.50) and improved spatial transferability, effectively bridging gaps in under-sampled regions. By capturing a broad range of traits with high spatial coverage, these maps can enhance our understanding of plant community properties and ecosystem functioning globally, and can serve as useful tools in modeling global biogeochemical processes and informing worldwide conservation efforts. Ultimately, our framework highlights the power and necessity of crowdsourced biodiversity data in high-resolution plant trait modeling. We anticipate that advancements in biodiversity data collection and remote sensing capabilities will further refine global trait mapping, fostering a dynamic trait-based understanding of the biosphere."
"Characterizing the dynamics of the backbone of flexible polymers such as Intrinsically Disordered Regions and Proteins (IDRs and IDPs) has proven to be a significant challenge in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations due to the high conformational variability. The widely-used mobility metric Root-Mean-Squared Fluctuations (RMSF) is powerless to provide information as defining a relevant reference structure is often not possible. We previously introduced a new flexibility metric to remedy this gap : the Local Flexibilities (LFs), derived -alongside the Local Curvatures (LCs)- from the Proteic Menger Curvatures (PMCs). Here we present a numba accelerated implementation for any polymer of the calculation of Menger curvatures as a MDAKit from the widely-used MDAnalysis package. We perform a benchmark with the RMSF and another flexibility metric derived from Proteic Blocks (PBs), the Equivalent Number of PBs (Neq), and show that the PMCs are an order of magnitude faster to compute on a modern CPU chip. We applied all 3 flexibility metrics to a {beta}III-tubulin monomer as an example, as tubulins are known to possess the entire range of proteic elements, from -helix and {beta}-sheets to a flexible loop and a disordered C-terminal tail (CTT). RMSF, LFs and Neq all succeed in identifying the flexible loops and the CTT, although the RMSF requires a system-specific alignment to do so. We believe that Menger curvatures will prove to be a valuable metric to study protein dynamics and polymers in general. The MDAKit package Menger_Curvature is readily available at https://github.com/EtienneReboul/menger_curvature"
"Insights into the admixture history between modern and archaic humans require accurately inferred introgressed fragments within modern genomes. Here, we introduce two enhancements to hidden Markov models (HMMs) implemented in hmmix. First, we develop a method for sampling hidden state sequences conditional on observed genomic data, enabling robust estimation of admixture summary statistics--such as admixture proportion and fragment length distributions. This represents an improvement compared to relying solely on point estimates as provided by classical decoding methods. Additionally, we integrate the Finite Markov Chain Imbedding (FMCI) framework, allowing exact analytical calculation of these admixture statistics, tailored to large scale human genomes. Second, we implement a novel hybrid decoding method which combines the strengths of Viterbi and Posterior decoding methods, substantially improving the reliability of archaic fragments identified. We validate these improvements on data from the 1000 Genomes Project and demonstrate that our sampling method yield more accurate admixture estimates from single individuals compared to existing approaches requiring extensive population-level datasets. Moreover we show how hybrid decoding can be instrumental in resolving the inference of local archaic haplotype structure in modern human genomes. These methodological advancements broadly enhance HMM-based analyses and will provide deeper insight into the complex history of genetic interactions between archaic and modern human populations."
"Microbial chain elongation is a sustainable process to convert organic residues into valuable biochemicals via anaerobic fermentation. The operating conditions for the bioreactor and the ecological interactions among functional populations are crucial in controlling this process, but they have not been completely ascertained. Here, we unraveled two operating conditions (i.e., environmental factors): (1) the substrate ratio of ethanol and lactate as co-electron donors, and (2) the temperature, which affected both the product specificity (i.e., function) and microbial dynamics of chain-elongating microbiomes in a continuously fed bioreactor with product extraction. Specifically, we found that the increase in the substrate ratio of ethanol to lactate shifted the microbiomes toward n-caprylate (C8) production, while the slightly higher operating temperatures of 37{degrees}C or 42{degrees}C were advantageous to n-caproate (C6) production. We detected a core microbiome that was similar for all environmental conditions and the two bioreactors, consisting of populations from Sphaerochaeta spp., Caproiciproducens spp., and Oscillospiraceae. Besides the core microbiome, we observed positive correlations between Erysipelaclostridiaceae UCG-004, Bacteroides spp., Oscillospiraceae NK4A214, Rikenellaceae RC9, and Pseudoclavibacter spp. with n-caprylate production. Similar populations compared to the core microbiome were positively correlated with n-caproate production. We showed that we can steer microbiomes toward a high specificity of certain medium-chain carboxylates.

"We have formed new short telomeres in Schizosaccharomyces pombe using an inducible nuclease that cuts near telomere repeats in cells that lack, cannot recruit or cannot fully activate telomerase. Sequencing these new telomeres showed that cells can divide at least 4 times with [~]30 bp of non-telomeric sequence at the chromosome end in cells lacking telomerase, which contrasts with current models for the roles of terminal single-stranded telomere repeats and the telomere proteins in telomere protection and replication. Cells that cannot recruit or activate telomerase had similar results, with additional rearrangements or telomere repeat addition, respectively."
"Making decisions often requires the integration of multiple pieces of information. An extensive body of research has investigated the neural architecture underpinning evidence accumulation in perceptual tasks where information is continuously present, but less is known about how this neural architecture operates in situations affording only intermittent glimpses of an evidence source. In two electroencephalography (EEG) experiments, participants judged the direction of up to two pulses of motion evidence separated by gaps of varying duration. Our behavioural analysis found that participants used both pulses but underutilised the second, and showed no systematic decrease in accuracy as a function of gap duration. At the neural level, motor beta lateralisation tracked cumulative evidence across pulses, maintaining a sustained representation of the decision variable through the gap and until response. In contrast, the centroparietal positivity (CPP), a previously-characterised signature of evidence accumulation, built up transiently to a peak that scaled with each pulses contribution to the decision variable (i.e. the absolute belief update it produced), falling back to baseline in between pulses. These patterns were recapitulated in a model where pulse-information transiently integrated at the CPP level is fed to and maintained at a bounded motor level, so that information presented later on in a trial is integrated only if a bound has not yet been reached."
"Respiration is a crucial metabolic process that converts macronutrients, carbohydrates and fats, and oxygen (O2) into energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) to support motor actions. In addition to the energy demands of movements, the brain is a significant energy consumer, accounting for approximately 20% of the bodys total energy expenditure and relying primarily on carbohydrates for neural activity and plasticity. However, it is not known whether O2-CO2 gas composition in breathing can serve as an indicator of neural activity and plasticity as they can for movement intensity. In the human reaching movement tasks, we evaluated time-constants of sensorimotor learning while recording O2-CO2 gas exchange. We computed the respiratory exchange ratio (RER), indicating which carbohydrate or fat is used preferentially, and found that the RER was unaffected by the execution and learning of reaching movements and that it was stable within individuals but varied across individuals. Interestingly, using computational modeling to identify short and long-time constants of sensorimotor learning, individual RER levels correlated with the magnitude of long-term, but not short-term memory. Furthermore, to experimentally manipulate the individual RER, we provided 200 kcal of glucose immediately before the task. Surprisingly, this simple intervention dramatically increased 24-hour retention by 21%. Together, the RER served as a remarkable proxy for long-term motor memory, and glucose intake shifted the physiological idling state for sensorimotor learning."
"Cardiac cycle duration, or interbeat interval (IBI), is the period from one heartbeat to the next. IBI changes from cycle to cycle. Periods with longer IBI are associated with higher sensitivity to external sensory stimuli (exteroception). Warning cues induce a state of attentive anticipation characterized by an increase in IBI (anticipatory cardiac deceleration) and faster reaction times. Ageing reduces the increase in IBI induced by warning cues and response speed. However, it is unclear which mechanism, if any, connects IBI with reaction time. The heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) is a cortical response evoked by the heartbeat, modulated by attention and associated with sensitivity to external sensory stimuli. HEP might be affected by IBI and mediate the association between cardiac output and cortical processing.

We investigated if the HEP was affected by warning cues as well as spontaneous fluctuations in IBI. To explore the impact of age-related changes in cardiac responses, we included young and older people [N = 33/29; 26/23 women; mean age 23/61 years]. We analysed the electroencephalograms and electrocardiograms simultaneously acquired during auditory cued simple reaction time and go/no-go tasks.

The warning cue did not induce significant changes in the HEP. Yet, fluctuations in IBI (not locked with the warning cue) affected the HEP and HEP amplitude was associated with average reaction time in the older group. However, on a trial-by-trial basis, reaction time was independent from IBI fluctuations.

In conclusion, we found no evidence that the HEP mediates the effect of attention orienting on reaction time."
"Specific character traits of mineralized endoskeletal tissues need to be clearly defined and comprehensively examined among extant chondrichthyans (elasmobranchs, such as sharks and skates, and holocephalans, such as chimaeras) to understand their evolution. For example, tiles of mineralized polygonal structures called tesserae occur at cartilage surfaces in chondrichthyans, but recent studies showing trabecular mineralization at elasmobranch cartilage surfaces suggest that tesserae are not as common as previously thought. Also, while areolar mineralized tissue in elasmobranchs is generally considered a unique, shared chondrichthyan feature, some chondrichthyan species demonstrate bone-like tissues in both a specific region of tesserae termed the cap zone and continuous (not tiled) mineralized neural arches. To clarify the distribution of specific endoskeletal features among extant chondrichthyans, adult skeletal tissues in a holocephalan chimaera (spotted ratfish) and two elasmobranchs (small-spotted catshark and little skate) were characterized using synchrotron radiation and desktop micro-CT imaging, and histological and immunofluorescent assays. Endoskeletal mineralization in the ratfish, catshark, and little skate varied both quantitively in tissue mineral density (TMD), and qualitatively in the morphology and localization of mineralized structures and tissues. For example, TMD of several skeletal elements was significantly lower in ratfish, compared to catshark and little skate. Trabecular and areolar mineralization were shared among these extant chondrichthyan species, but tesserae and bone-like tissues were not. Interestingly, three separate analyses argued that the chimaera endoskeleton retains embryonic features (i.e., paedomorphic with respect to elasmobranchs). This study further proposes general terminology for character states of the extant chondrichthyan endoskeleton and infers those states in ancestral chondrichthyans with reference to fossil data."
"Elevated extracellular matrix (ECM) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is associated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis. We hypothesized that modifying the ECM may enhance response to chemotherapy. We measured chemotherapy-induced changes in the TME of two mouse models of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) that differed in chemotherapy response. Treatment of the chemo-sensitive tumors triggered dynamic transcriptional ECM and immune changes and structural modifications of ECM proteins. These changes, observed over twenty-days post-chemotherapy, had relevance to HGSOC patient responses to chemotherapy. Integrating transcriptomics with ECM structure metrics, we identified ECM targets, including lysyl oxidase (LOX), that might enhance chemotherapy in less responsive mouse tumors. Given alone or in combination with chemotherapy, a pan-LOX inhibitor (PXS-5505) modulated fibroblast and immune cell distribution and reduced tumor stiffness in HGSOC chemo-resistant mouse tumors. Moreover, pre-treatment with PXS-5505 improved response to chemotherapy. We conclude that pretreatment with ECM targeting agents may improve response to chemotherapy, by altering ECM structure and immune responses."
"Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase 2 (MTHFD2), the rate-limiting enzyme of mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism, is one of the most highly expressed metabolic enzymes across diverse cancers and lymphoproliferative disorders. However, its exact roles in oncogenic metabolism remain poorly defined. We show that MTHFD2 is a key regulator of mitochondrial energetics in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), an in vitro model of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). We also delineate a role for MTHFD2 in fueling de novo creatine synthesis; MTHFD2 mediates the production of glycine, a necessary substrate for creatine synthesis, through serine catabolism. Aminomethyltransferase (AMT) suppression short-circuits the glycine cleavage system (GCS) to augment LCL mitochondrial glycine levels. Creatine synthesis is hypostatic to mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism; inhibition of creatine synthesis improves LCL fitness only when MTHFD2 is lost. Our findings emplace MTHFD2 at the nexus of amino acid and energy metabolism pathways in LCLs, with potential clinical ramifications for PTLD.

Highlights* Complete activation of creatine synthesis in an in vitro cellular model of PTLD

* Creatine synthesis is a major sink for mitochondrial 1C-derived glycine

* Reverse GCS activity due to AMT deficiency in lymphoblastoid cells

* Epistasis between mitochondrial 1C metabolism and creatine synthesis

eTOC BlurbLeung et al. demonstrate that MTHFD2 is crucial for creatine synthesis in lymphoproliferative disorders. MTHFD2 supports forward 1C flux through SHMT and drives reverse GCS activity to augment mitochondrial glycine, a substrate for creatine synthesis. Tumor-suppressive effects of creatine synthesis are unmasked with MTHFD2 loss, exhibiting metabolic epistasis."
"The vasculature is a prominent component of developmental and adult tissue microenvironments. How, tissue specific characteristics and environmental states influence vascular biology and function, remains largely understudied.

Previously, we discovered crosstalk between the adult intestinal epithelium and the vasculature-like tracheal system of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which is driven by reactive oxygen species (ROS) during pathogen induced-intestinal regeneration. However, chemical stress signals alone are insufficient to explain the rich diversity of vasculature/tissue interactions in living systems and justify the widely observed adaptation of the vascular network in physiology and disease. Here, we uncover reciprocal, mechanochemical interorgan communication between the adult intestine and its vascular niche, which shapes vascular and epithelial tissue adaptations and drives stem cell proliferation during intestinal regeneration and tumour growth. Mechanistically, apoptotic epithelial cells within the regenerating intestine induce local and global mechanical changes in the gut, which results in activation and upregulation of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo in a subset of gut-associated trachea. Piezo drives a specific molecular program within the trachea through activation of the mechanosensitive transcription factor Yorkie/YAP, leading to tracheal remodelling and intestinal stem cell proliferation. Furthermore, we identify a non-redundant role of vascular Piezo1 driving remodelling of the intestinal crypt vasculature and inducing crypt growth, WNT signalling activity, and stem cell proliferation in the regenerating mouse small intestine.

Our cross-species in vivo study reveals previously unrecognised mechanosensory regulation of intestinal regeneration and tumourigenesis through the vascular-stem cell niche and highlights the importance of studying tissue and context specific vascular cell biology to understand intestinal plasticity and the complexity of tissue/vasculature interactions within a living organ."
"Visual perception is typically based on a one-to-one mapping between stimuli and conscious experiences. However, under bistable conditions, identical sensory inputs can elicit alternating perceptions, requiring the brain to resolve ambiguity. The mechanisms underlying transitions between distinct perceptual states and their sustained maintenance remain poorly understood. In this ultra-high-field (7T) fMRI study, we investigated the neural dynamics of perception using a bistable motion stimulus (ambiguous motion quartet) that evoked endogenous alternations between horizontal and vertical motion, compared to a control condition (physical motion quartet) with unambiguous sensory input. Consistent with previous findings, the human motion complex (hMT+) played a central role in processing both physical and ambiguous motion conditions. By dissociating neural activity during perceptual transitions from sustained perceptions, we found that hMT+ mostly interacts dynamically with area 46 in the frontal cortex and PF/PFm within the inferior parietal lobe during transitions and with subregions of the superior parietal lobe during sustained perceptions. Beyond local activity, computational modeling revealed an increase in hierarchical organization across cortical networks during the ambiguous condition. In particular, the same frontal and parietal regions exhibited ascension within the functional hierarchy, likely reflecting their specific role in coordinating computations for resolving ambiguity."
"MotivationHighly mutable viruses continuously evolve, with some posing major pandemic risks. However, standardized neutralization assays and up-to-date viral panels are often lacking, limiting evaluation of immunogens and identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Closing these gaps is essential for guiding effective countermeasure development.

ResultsIn this study, we present Viral Protein Panel Design (VIProDesign), a computational tool for designing viral protein panels that address the high sequence diversity of rapidly evolving viruses. VIProDesign uses the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm to select representative strains and applies the elbow-point method based on cumulative Shannon entropy to balance diversity and panel size. We used VIProDesign to generate optimized panels for Betacoronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), Influenza virus, Norovirus, and Lassa virus. The tool also supports customizable panel sizes, making it suitable for both resource-limited contexts and early-stage research. This flexible approach streamlines viral panel design across diverse pathogens. Although VIProDesign was originally developed for viral proteins, its underlying framework is broadly applicable to the selection of representative protein panels across diverse taxa, including bacterial species, toxins, and other biologically relevant protein families."
"Recent prior work suggests a preferential relationship between working memory capacity (WMC) and proactive control, yet the neural mechanisms that support this relationship are still not well understood. We directly addressed this question by leveraging the Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control (DMCC) project, as it employed a fMRI neuroimaging design optimized to test for individual differences (sample N > 100), with task variants that independently assessed proactive and reactive control relative to baseline conditions. Behavioral analyses replicated prior work with the AX-CPT paradigm, in which a measure of target preparation based on contextual cues (the A-cue Bias index) was both reliably increased under task conditions encouraging proactive control and positively associated with WMC. Analyses of fMRI activity indicated that A-cue Bias was selectively linked to increased cue-related neural activity in left motor cortex (lMOT). Additionally, WMC was associated with increased cue-related activation in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC), even when statistically controlling for baseline and reactive conditions. The relationship between these two effects was supported by a latent path analysis, which suggested that the rDLPFC-lMOT circuit preferentially mediates the WMC-A-cue Bias relationship present under proactive task conditions. The results suggest this neural circuit may translate strategic task goals into active response preparation as a mechanism of proactive control. Individuals high in WMC may be better able to implement proactive task strategies when instructed via contextual cues. The sensitivity of the rDLPFC-lMOT circuit to individual differences suggest it as a potential target for cognitive enhancement."
"Sleep and pregnancy are contentious bedfellows; sleep disorders and disturbances are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, although much is still unknown about this relationship. Sleep and pregnancy have been studied in many models, but most focus heavily on mammals. However, pregnancy is ubiquitous across the animal kingdom - a hallmark of convergent evolution; similarly sleep is a shared feature across diverse species. Here, we present an ideal model in which to study the dynamics between sleep and pregnancy in invertebrates. The Pacific beetle mimic cockroach, Diploptera punctata, is a viviparous cockroach species that uses milk proteins to nourish its young with a broodsac over a three month pregnancy. However, little is known about the relationship between this unique reproductive biology and daily rhythms of activity and sleep. We established that D. punctata displayed a peak in activity shortly following sunset, with males significantly more active than females. When scavenging behavior was examined, males and non-pregnant females emerged more often and traveled further from a shelter compared to pregnant females, suggesting reduced risk-taking behavior in late pregnancy. Chronic disturbance of sleep during pregnancy negatively impacted embryo development by increasing gestational duration and decreasing the transcription of milk proteins. These findings indicate that sleep is key to embryo development and that pregnancy has a significant impact on the daily rhythms of activity in Diploptera punctata. More broadly, we present a tractable invertebrate model for understanding the relationship between sleep and pregnancy, which will aid in the exploration of the poorly understood interface between these two ubiquitous and highly conserved traits."
"The ERK5 signaling pathway has recently emerged as a critical regulator of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) biology, contributing to tumor initiation, progression, and maintenance. In this study, we identify VCAN, a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, as a novel transcriptional target of ERK5 and a central mediator of ERK5-related oncogenesis. Through a combination of genetic (silencing, overexpression) and pharmacological approaches, applied in both a chemically induced murine sarcoma model and several human STS cell lines, we demonstrate that ERK5 positively regulates VCAN expression. Functionally, VCAN silencing (by shRNAs) recapitulates the phenotypes of ERK5 silencing, including impaired migration, adhesion, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. Conversely, VCAN overexpression rescues these effects, confirming its essential role in ERK5-mediated oncogenesis. Furthermore, transcriptomic profiling reveals that VCAN accounts for a substantial portion of ERK5-regulated gene expression program. Analyses of human STS patient samples reveal significantly elevated mRNA levels of both VCAN and ERK5 compared to normal tissues. Notably, a strong correlation between VCAN and ERK5 expression, both at mRNA and protein levels, emerged in biopsies from leiomyosarcomas and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas. Together, these findings uncover VCAN as a key effector in ERK5-driven tumorigenesis and highlight the ERK5/VCAN signaling axis as a promising therapeutic target in soft tissue sarcomas."
"Three capsid types have been recognized from the nuclei of herpesvirus-infected cells: empty A-capsids, scaffolding-containing B-capsids, and DNA-filled C-capsids. Despite progress in determining atomic structures of these capsids and extracellular virions in recent years, debate persists concerning the origins and temporal relationships among these capsids during capsid assembly and genome packaging. Here, we have imaged over 300,000 capsids of herpes simplex virus type 1 by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) and exhaustively classified them to characterize the structural heterogeneity of the DNA-translocating portal complex and their functional states. The resultant atomic structures reveal not only the expected A-, B-, and C-capsids, but also capsids with portal vertices similar to C-capsids but no resolvable genome in the capsid lumen, which we named D-capsids. The dodecameric dsDNA-translocating portal complex varies across these capsid types in their radial positions in icosahedral capsids and exhibits structural dynamics within each capsid type. In D-capsids, terminal DNA density exists in multiple conformations including one reminiscent to that in C-capsids, suggesting D-capsids are products of failed DNA retention. This interpretation is supported by varying amounts of DNA outside individual D-capsids and by correlation of capsid counts observed in situ of infected cell nuclei and those after purification. Additionally, an ""anchoring"" segment of the scaffold protein is resolved interacting with the portal baskets of A- and B-capsids but not D- and C-capsids. Taken together, our data indicate that A-capsids arise from failed DNA packaging and D-capsids from failed genome retention, clarifying the origins of empty capsids in herpesvirus assembly.

SignificanceAs the prototypical herpesvirus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) exhibits a global seroprevalence of 67% and approaching 90% in some localities. Herpesvirus infections can cause devastating cancers and birth defects, with HSV-1 infections leading to cold sores among the general population worldwide and blindness in developing nations. Here, we present atomic structures of the capsids sorted out from the nuclear isolates of HSV-1 infected cells, including the previously recognized A-, B-, and C-capsids, as well as the newly identified D-capsid. The structures show the details of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions within each capsid type and the positional and interactional variability of the viral DNA-translocating portal vertex among these capsids. Importantly, our findings suggest that A-capsids are products of failed dsDNA packaging and D-capsids of failed genome retention. Together, the high-resolution 3D structures clarify the processes of genome packaging, maintenance, and ejection during capsid assembly, which are conserved across all herpesviruses."

"Although high-affinity and high-specificity aptamers can be obtained by SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment), and have good activity in vitro, their performance in vivo is poor. This is mainly because of the degradation of linear nucleic acids by nucleases in body fluids and the difficulty of maintaining stable 3D structures in complex body fluid environments, which seriously hinders the clinical application of aptamers. This makes circular aptamers, which can resist degradation and are more stable in complex body fluid environments, an attractive option. However, the cyclization process may have a considerable impact on the structure of the original linear aptamer, and blind cyclization may lead to a decrease in its affinity. Here, we developed a new method to guide the cyclization of saxitoxin (STX) aptamers based on molecular computation, and verified the activity of circular aptamers through bioactivity experiments to further verify the authenticity and reliability of our methods. Consistent with the computational analysis, although circularization disrupts the G4 structure, circular aptamer not only has a higher affinity than the linear one but also provides certain protection to mice and greatly prolongs their survival, which proves the accuracy and reliability of the circular structure designed by our computational method. Our findings provide important ideas for better guidance in the design of circular aptamers and demonstrate their great potential in therapeutic applications."
"ObjectiveTranscranial Electrical Stimulation and Visual Stimulation in the gamma band (30-100 Hz, especially 40 Hz) are increasingly used to study and even enhance human cognition. Combining both techniques would be of scientific and clinical value, provided that Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) are measured concurrently to determine any neuronal effects of the electrical brain stimulation. This poses a substantial methodological challenge. We aimed to demonstrate that recording visually evoked 40 Hz activity with EEG during electrical brain stimulation is possible and to explore potential interactions.

ApproachWe tested if electrical and visual stimulation might interact depending on which brain areas are electrically stimulated (Experiment 1; N=25) and how closely the respective frequencies match (Experiment 2; N=25). Experiment 3 (N=25) assessed how effectively the data processing pipeline can mitigate electrical artefacts and recover real evoked neuronal activity. SSVEPs were processed and analysed in the time domain using an optimised adaptive template subtraction approach.

Main Results40 Hz SSVEPs were successfully recorded during frequency-matched electrical stimulation applied between central and occipital regions. Waveform correlations revealed that SSVEPs from combined visual and electrical stimulation were more similar in shape to baseline SSVEPs from visual stimulation alone than to control data from electrical stimulation alone. Accordingly, during combined stimulation, the recovered signals were stronger in amplitude than the electrical control data. We found no evidence of interactions between electrical and visual stimulation.

SignificanceWe demonstrated that 40 Hz SSVEPs can be reliably measured with EEG during frequency-matched electrical brain stimulation, distinguishing neuronal activity from electrical or physiological confounds. This method enables fundamental and clinical researchers to combine rhythmic sensory and electrical stimulation in the gamma band and concurrently quantify neuronal electrophysiological effects."
"Recombination has long been considered the primary mechanism to bring beneficial alleles together, which can increase the speed of adaptation from standing genetic variation. Recombination is fundamental to the transporter hypothesis proposed to explain precise parallel adaptation in Threespine Stickleback. We studied an instance of freshwater adaptation in the Threespine Stickleback system using whole genomic data from an evolutionary time series to observe the genomic dynamics underlying rapid parallel adaptation. Our experiment showed that rapid adaptation to a freshwater environment depended on a few individuals with large haploblocks of freshwater-adaptive alleles (jackpot carriers) present among the anadromous (i.e., sea-run) founders at low frequencies. Biological kinship analyses indicate that mating among jackpot carriers and between jackpot carriers and non-jackpot individuals led to a rapid increase in freshwater-adaptive alleles within the first few generations. This process allowed the population to overcome a substantial bottleneck likely caused by the low fitness of first-generation stickleback with a few freshwater-adaptive alleles born in the lake. Additionally, we found evidence that the genetic load that emerged from population growth after the bottleneck may have been reduced through an increase in homozygosity by inbreeding, ultimately purging deleterious alleles. Recombination likely played a limited role in this case of very rapid adaptation."
"Tuberculosis (TB) pathology involves complex immune responses within granulomatous lesions. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized the cellular compositions of necrotizing granulomatous lesions that developed in the lungs of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice. We identified 11 distinct major cell types, including phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages, and T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Among T cells, particularly, Pdcd1 {gamma}{delta} T cells were detected in necrotizing granulomatous lesions, suggesting their potential role in the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis. Within the macrophage populations, we identified a cluster with significantly higher Plin2 expression compared to other clusters, whose transcriptomic profile was consistent with that of foamy macrophages. A subset of the Plin2-expressing macrophages was identified as a major source of Ifnb1 and Cxcl1, suggesting their involvement in type I interferon signaling and neutrophil recruitment. Furthermore, we identified Flrt2, Hyal1, and Mmp13 as novel molecular markers of Plin2-expressing macrophages, which were localized to the peripheral rim regions of necrotizing granulomas. In conclusion, our results provide the immune landscape of necrotizing granulomas and reveal novel functional states of macrophages contributing to TB pathogenesis."
"Cell morphogenesis is crucial for the physiology of animals and fungi alike. While animals typically shape their cells using the actin cytoskeleton, fungi control cell shape through polarized deposition of new cell wall material, which is inflated by intracellular osmotic ""turgor"" pressure. Understanding where and when these mechanisms evolved is essential for understanding the evolution of cell morphogenesis. To this end, we study chytrid fungi, which have a cell type that lacks a cell wall (the ""zoospore"") and a cell type that has a cell wall (the ""sporangium""). While chytrid sporangia rely on polarized cell wall growth to control shape, we previously showed that the ""frog-killing"" chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) uses actin to control zoospore shape. Whether either zoospores or sporangia also use intracellular pressure regulation in cell shape control remains an open question. Here, we use live-cell imaging, environmental perturbations, and small molecule inhibitors to show that Bd sporangia generate and maintain turgor pressure, while Bd zoospores use specialized organelles called contractile vacuoles to pump water out of the cell, thereby keeping internal pressure low. Because chytrid fungi diverged prior to the evolution of the Dikarya--the fungal group comprising yeast, mushrooms, and filamentous fungi--these findings suggest that turgor pressure evolved early, and that cell morphogenesis underwent a major transition during early fungal evolution. We also suggest that the last common fungal ancestor may have, like chytrid fungi, employed stage-specific strategies for cell shape control--illustrating how developmental flexibility in cellular mechanisms can serve as a wellspring of evolutionary innovation."
"Engineered living materials (ELMs) leverage the integrative advantages of materials science and synthetic biology for advanced functionalities. Predicting and controlling cellular behavior is essential for designing and building ELMs, requiring fundamental understanding of the growth dynamics of encapsulated cells. Here, we interrogate the interference of constrained growth on the engineered functionalities and cellular physiology of cyanobacteria and unveil the dynamic interaction between cell growth and spatial confinements within photosynthetic ELMs. We observed that engineered cyanobacteria within ELMs exhibited compromised performances in growth, uptake of non-natural substrate, and synthesis of customized products, while ELMs could protect encapsulated cells from external stresses. Besides commonly accepted external influences, we identified abnormally high levels of reactive oxygen species and impaired oxygenic photosynthesis inside the cells encapsulated in ELMs. Finally, we illustrated the dynamics of cell growth within the confined spaces enveloped by the material matrices, forming clustered cell aggregates and compressed growth bubbles until the spatial limits. Our study provides a fundamental yet often overlooked connection between cellular behavior and spatial confinements, consolidating the foundation for advanced ELM innovations."
"The superficial white matter (SWM), immediately beneath the cortical mantle, is thought to play a major role in cortico-cortical connectivity as well as large-scale brain function. Yet, this compartment remains rarely studied due to its complex organization. Our objectives were to develop and disseminate a robust computational framework to study SWM organization based on 3D histology and high-field 7T MRI. Using data from the BigBrain and Ahead 3D histology initiatives, we first interrogated variations in cell staining intensities across different cortical regions and different SWM depths. These findings were then translated to in-vivo 7T quantitative myelin-sensitive MRI, including T1 relaxometry (T1 map) and magnetization transfer saturation (MTsat). As indicated by the statistical moments of the SWM intensity profiles, the first 2 mm below the cortico-subcortical boundary were characterized by high structural complexity. We quantified SWM microstructural variation using a non-linear dimensionality reduction method and examined the relationship of the resulting microstructural gradients with indices of cortical geometry, as well as structural and functional connectivity. Our results showed correlations between SWM microstructural gradients, as well as curvature and cortico-cortical functional connectivity. Our study provides novel insights into the organization of SWM in the human brain and underscores the potential of SWM mapping to advance fundamental and applied neuroscience research.

"Astrocytes play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis through functional gap junctions (GJs) primarily formed by connexin43 (Cx43) in the cortical gray matter. These GJs facilitate electrical and metabolic coupling between astrocytes, allowing the passage of ions, glucose, and metabolites. Dysregulation of Cx43 has been implicated in various pathologies, including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and acquired epilepsy. After mild TBI/concussion, we previously identified a subset of atypical astrocytes, which are correlated with the development of spontaneous seizures. These astrocytes exhibit reduced Cx43 expression and coupling. However, atypical astrocytes represent a relatively small subset of astrocytes within the cortical gray matter and previous studies suggest an overall increase of Cx43 protein after TBI. Additionally, Cx43 also has non-junctional and channel-independent functions, which include hemichannel communication with the extracellular milieu, cell adhesion, protein trafficking, protein-protein interactions, and intracellular signaling. In the present study, we set out to determine how mild TBI initiates alterations to Cx43 protein expression and localization, how they may be regulated, and whether they contribute to seizure susceptibility. We demonstrate remarkable heterogeneity of Cx43 protein levels from astrocyte to astrocyte. In accordance with our previous findings, a subset of astrocytes lost Cx43 expression, yet total cortical Cx43 protein increased. At the subcellular level, junctional Cx43 protein levels remained stable, while hemichannels and/or cytoplasmic Cx43 were increased. Phosphorylation of Cx43 at serine 368, a key regulatory site influencing GJ assembly and function, increased after mild TBI. Critically, Cx43S368A mutant mice, lacking this phosphorylation, exhibited reduced susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. These findings suggest that TBI-induced Cx43 phosphorylation enhances seizure susceptibility, while inhibiting this modification presents a potential therapeutic avenue for mitigating neuronal hyperexcitability and seizure development.

Significance statementConnexin43 (Cx43) is the main protein comprising astrocyte gap junctions which mediate astrocyte coupling into cellular networks, but it also has other non-junctional functions. Many pathologies present with altered Cx43 regulation. In this study, we assessed Cx43 alterations after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) in a mouse model. We found that while some astrocytes lost Cx43 expression, other astrocytes had increased cytoplasmic and hemichannel Cx43. This increase correlated with an increase in phosphorylated Cx43 at serine 368. Cx43S368A mutant mice, lacking this phosphorylation, exhibited reduced susceptibility to seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). These findings suggest that TBI-induced Cx43 phosphorylation enhances seizure susceptibility."
"Crop models need to be regularly upgraded with parametrization for new cultivars but this requires calibration, which is a major challenge. With winter wheat cultivar Rubisko as a case study, we propose to apply a calibration protocol to estimate the parameters of this new cultivar with multi-trials experimental data. We tested the calibration protocol in different conditions including or not LAI and/or biomass experimental data and we found that the resulting LAI and biomass dynamics strongly diverge. Several key findings emerge from this study: (1) RUE parameters should be excluded from the calibration process, as their critical role in biomass dynamics causes the optimization algorithm to treat them as adjustment parameters, resulting in unrealistic values for multiple parameters; (2) either LAI or biomass variables alone are sufficient for calibration, enabling experimental efforts to focus on one variable rather than both; and (3) the use of a synthetic dataset has facilitated the identification of the optimal type and timing of data collection needed to parameterize a new variety in the model. Moreover, the proposed methodology offers extrapolatable solutions applicable to other contexts (e.g., different models or datasets) and provides guidance on acquiring the most effective dataset for optimal calibration. The unbalanced structure of our dataset also highlighted the need to mobilize other calibration criteria (weighted RMSE) and alternative solutions to bridge the gap between quantitative metrics and empirical visual assessments."
"Neurons rely on spatial and temporal control of protein synthesis to respond rapidly and locally to external stimuli, a process facilitated by the dynamic localization and modification of ribosomes. While previous research has shown that neuronal activity can regulate ribosome localization and modify translation rates, little is known about ribosomal assembly within neuronal processes. Here, we investigated the potential for local ribosome maturation in rat neurons using proteomics, RNA sequencing, and imaging methods. We detected an abundance of ribosome biogenesis factors (RBFs) in distal neuronal compartments, particularly those associated with the late stages of ribosome assembly. Moreover, we detected cytosolic pre-rRNA species in dendrites, alongside the enzymes necessary for their processing, suggesting that local ribosome maturation can occur far from the nucleus. These findings challenge conventional models that confine ribosome biogenesis to nuclear and perinuclear regions and suggest that neurons may fine-tune local protein synthesis by regulating ribosome assembly near synaptic sites. This mechanism may enable rapid modulation of the translational capacity in response to physiological changes, regulating synaptic plasticity and local protein synthesis in neurons.

Significance StatementNeurons require precise spatial and temporal regulation of protein synthesis to adapt rapidly to external stimuli, particularly at synapses. Our study challenges the view that new ribosomes can be made exclusively near the nucleus and reveals that ribosome biogenesis factors and pre-rRNA processing enzymes are present in distal neuronal compartments. These findings suggest that ribosome maturation can occur locally in dendrites, enabling rapid, spatially targeted modulation of translational capacity. This mechanism provides a different framework for understanding how neurons regulate synaptic plasticity and adapt to physiological changes. By demonstrating that ribosome assembly may extend beyond the nucleus, this work highlights a previously unrecognized layer of neuronal protein synthesis control, potentially transforming our understanding of how neurons orchestrate local responses to environmental cues."
"Cancer progression involves loss of differentiation and acquisition of stem cell-like traits, broadly referred to as ""stemness"". Here, we test whether the level of stemness, assessed by a transcriptome-derived Stemness score, can quantitatively track prostate cancer (PCa) development, progression, therapy resistance, metastasis, plasticity, and patient survival. Integrative analysis of transcriptomic data from 87,183 samples across 26 datasets reveals a progressive increase in Stemness and decline in pro-differentiation androgen receptor activity (AR-A) along the PCa continuum, with metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) exhibiting the highest Stemness and lowest AR-A. Both the general Stemness score and a newly developed 12-gene ""PCa-Stem Signature"" correlate with and predict poor clinical outcomes. Mechanistically, increased AR-A may promote Stemness in early-stage PCa while MYC amplification and bi-allelic RB1 loss likely drive greatly elevated Stemness in mCRPC where AR-A is suppressed. Our findings establish Stemness as a robust quantitative measure of PCa aggressiveness and offer a scalable framework for PCa risk stratification."
"BackgroundThe P100/P100m component of auditory event-related potentials/fields is considered a potential biomarker of atypical arousal and language abnormalities in children with ASD. When elicited by complex speech-like sounds with regular temporal or frequency structure, P100/P100m may be influenced by sustained negativity (SN), which can reduce its amplitude due to opposing current polarity.

MethodsUsing MEG, we investigated how acoustic regularities affect P100m latency and amplitude differences between TD children and those with ASD. MEG was recorded in 35 ASD and 39 TD boys (7-12 years) in response to control sounds (non-periodic, non-vowels) and stimuli with temporal regularity (periodic non-vowels), frequency regularity (non-periodic vowels), or both (periodic vowels). P100m was estimated using distributed source localization.

ResultsIn both groups, P100m amplitude and latency decreased in response to acoustic regularities, accompanied by a proportional increase in SN. No group differences were observed in P100m latency, amplitude, or their modulation by stimulus characteristics. In ASD, P100m latency variability was increased, and higher P100m amplitudes in the left auditory cortex were negatively associated with cumulative language and intellectual abilities.

ConclusionsIn children, changes in P100m in response to acoustic regularities are most parsimoniously explained by an enhancement of SN with opposite polarity. No consistent relationship was found between P100m parameters or their modulation by acoustic regularities and ASD diagnosis. However, variations in cortical maturation and/or habituation processes, which affect the left-hemispheric P100m, may be relevant to cognitive and language functioning in children with ASD."
"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication and sensory processing. The ability to orient towards sounds is a key component of social interactions, yet auditory spatial attention remains relatively understudied in ASD, despite some prior research indicating differences in this domain. Here, we investigate the neural signatures associated with passive auditory spatial attention in children with ASD (n = 21, ages 6-17) relative to age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children (n = 31), using source-localized magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants listened passively, while watching a silenced movie, to non-social auditory stimuli designed to either remain lateralized to one hemifield (stay trials), or to change in location from one side to the contralateral hemifield (jump trials). Linear mixed effect modeling showed lower cortical activation in the auditory cortex in the ASD group in response to jump trials, relative to the TD group. Additionally, functional connectivity analyses showed higher alpha-band functional connectivity in the ASD group between auditory cortex seeds and frontoparietal regions known to be recruited during auditory spatial attention. Right prefrontal alpha-band connectivity estimates were associated with worse behaviorally assessed auditory processing scores and increased ASD symptomatology. Our results align with the hypothesis that auditory spatial attention generally, and specifically orientation to sounds even when experienced passively, differs in ASD individuals."
"The use of camera traps to monitor unmarked animal populations has expanded during the last decade, leading to the development of several density estimation methods. This plethora of methods may be confusing for the newcomer to the field. Some methods, such as the random encounter model, require the knowledge of the mean travel speed of the animals, while others, such as camera trap distance sampling, do not rely on such assumptions. Different methods, like instantaneous sampling, camera trap distance sampling, and the association model, rely on similar types of data, but do not seem identical. In this article, I explore the relationships between different density estimators, including the random encounter model, the random encounter and staying time model, the time-to-event model, camera-trap distance sampling, the association model, and the space-to-event model. I show how these different estimators are related under two simplifying assumptions (perfect detectability, and animal movements following the ideal gas model). I develop a map of mathematical relationships between these estimators, which can help newcomers to understand how these methods are interconnected."
"Small membrane proteins represent an abundant and ubiquitous class of proteins that are often up-regulated when cells encounter unfavorable conditions, yet details about their exact function are largely missing. In bacteria, these proteins consist of typically less than 50 amino acids and contain a single transmembrane domain, but lack any detectable catalytic activity. Thus, the benefit of producing these proteins during stress conditions is unknown. In the current study we used a multidisciplinary approach to determine the function of the 27 amino acid long protein YohP in E. coli. Our proteomics approach revealed that YohP production leads to an up-regulation of proteins involved in membrane protection and to a down-regulation of many enzymes involved in key metabolic processes, such as nucleotide biosynthesis. Further biochemical characterizations revealed increased cardiolipin content in the membrane, a partial dissipation of the membrane potential and reduced membrane fluidity in YohP-containing membranes. Finally, our data show that YohP production induces the stringent response and leads to elevated levels of (p)ppGpp. Overall, our data indicate that the YohP-induced proteome and membrane changes initiate a state of metabolic silencing that protects E. coli against stress and helps to conserve cellular resources."
"Bacteria on leaf surfaces encounter highly variable access to nutrients and water. This oligotrophic environment is partly due to the presence of cuticular waxes that render the leaf surface hydrophobic, reducing the leaching of nutrients and water loss from inside the leaf. Bacteria have evolved adaptations to survive under these conditions. While alkB, an alkane hydroxylase gene, is widely prevalent in leaf-associated bacteria, its role and activity is unclear. Here, we developed a bioreporter in Pseudomonas sp. FF2 (PFF2) to investigate alkB promoter activity in diesel and on Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. In general, alkB promoter activity is highly heterogeneous, with a subpopulation exhibiting strong activation, suggesting bet-hedging in alkane metabolism. In planta, the promoter remained active over the course of seven days, indicating constant access of alkanes over time. Single-cell fluorescence intensity was heterogeneous, reflecting differences in microhabitats on the leaf surface or bet-hedging. While our results support a role of alkB in bacterial adaptation to the phyllosphere, direct evidence of cuticular wax degradation is missing. Future studies should trace the incorporation of plant-derived aliphatic compounds to elucidate the potential use of alkanes and other aliphatic compounds as resources for bacteria in the leaf environment."
"Invasion of erythrocytes by members of the Plasmodium genus is an essential step of the parasite lifecycle, orchestrated by numerous host-parasite interactions. In P. falciparum Rh5, with PfCyRPA, PfRipr, PfCSS, and PfPTRAMP, forms the essential PCRCR complex which binds basigin on the erythrocyte surface. Rh5 is restricted to P. falciparum and its close relatives; however, PTRAMP, CSS and Ripr orthologs are present across the Plasmodium genus. We investigated PTRAMP, CSS and Ripr orthologs from three species to elucidate common features of the complex. Like P. falciparum, PTRAMP and CSS form a disulfide-linked heterodimer in both P. vivax and P. knowlesi with all three species forming a complex (PCR) with Ripr by binding its C-terminal region. Cross-reactive antibodies targeting the PCR complex differentially inhibit merozoite invasion. Cryo-EM visualization of the P. knowlesi PCR complex confirmed predicted models and revealed a core invasion scaffold in Plasmodium spp. with implications for vaccines targeting multiple species of malaria-causing parasites."
"Genes and other genomic elements have variable presence absence patterns across most bacterial species. Pangenome fluidity is often invoked to measure this genome flux. Fluid pangenomes contain genes found only in subsets of species strains. Tighter pangenomes contain more genes that define a shared core. Species definitions are often tied to this pangenome diversity. In any global comparative framework, pangenomes must be calculated across all known species. But defining pangenomes is fraught with computational and biological challenges, requiring assembly, annotation, alignment, and phylogenetics of millions of orthologs. We offer an alternate view that de-centers the gene and emphasizes the raw information content of sequences. Information is data that reduces uncertainty. Tight pangenomes, with elements repeated across every strain in a species ensemble, contain more complete information. In contrast, fluid pangenomes have more uncertainty, higher complexity, and higher information diversity. Bacterial lifestyle has been shown to drive this information diversity. For example, challenging environments often increase information diversity by encouraging the accrual of auxiliary genes. Here, we employ agile complexity metrics to quantify this increase. Ensembles of free-living, motile, and non-pathogenic species have high genomic complexity. Ensemble complexity decreases in species bound to specific hosts. Because we eliminate annotation and alignment, our method is fast enough to evaluate species across all known bacterial genomes. The approach democratizes classification and our results highlight how broad the term ""species"" has become."
"The cerebral cortex shows species-specific variations in size and organization, likely accounting for distinct behavioral abilities. These structural differences may reflect evolutionary changes in the developmental expression of shared genes. To investigate this possibility, we compared cell-type-specific gene expression across species in the developing mouse and human neocortex, and human cortical organoids, by generating a shared transcriptional reference framework. This identified genes with conserved/divergent expression patterns, providing a molecular foundation to interrogate species-specific cellular properties. Using this resource, we discovered that the transcription factor JUNB is expressed in human but not mouse progenitors. Through cell-type-specific gain- and loss-of-function experiments in mice and human organoids, we demonstrate that JUNB bidirectionally controls human cortical features, including progenitor proliferation rates, neuronal production timing, and total neuronal output. This reveals how cell-type-specific regulation of shared genes during development can drive species-specific cortical features, providing a framework for understanding the molecular basis of cortical evolution."
"The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is a critical brain region orchestrating survival behaviours including feeding. Its sparse intrinsic synaptic connectivity allows long-range projections to modulate its activity. Some of these projections arise from the cerebral cortex, which is known to influence feeding. However, the functional and anatomical organization of cortico-hypothalamic pathways have remained poorly studied. We used anatomical and optogenetic mapping to show that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is the strongest cortical input source to the LH, followed by a lateral associative region including the insular cortex (IC), and the ventral subiculum. Input from the mPFC and IC had markedly different synaptic dynamics and were integrated supralinearly. IC input surpassed that of the mPFC in a subpopulation of highly excitable dorsal LH neurons which had a strong h-current. Input from the mPFC showed selective targeting to LH neurons which project back to the mPFC, suggesting the existence of a direct feedback loop. Overall, these results identify a direct prefrontal hypothalamic pathway which is poised to dominate rapid cortical control of hypothalamic activity."
"Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are small dsDNA viruses that replicate in the host cell nucleus, primarily relying on the viral encoded large tumor antigen (LTA). Aided by recent advances in molecular biology techniques, the list of known PyVs is rapidly growing, revealing unexpected broad sequence, and host heterogenicity. Given their dependence on nuclear localization, large tumor antigens represent an attractive model for studying the nuclear transport process. A comprehensive analysis of the evolution of classical nuclear localization signals (cNLSs) within LTAs encoded by PyVs infecting mammals highlighted strong positional conservation of cNLSs between the LXCXE motif and the origin-binding domain (OBD). Here we extend such analysis to PyVs infecting non-mammalian hosts. We combined biochemical, structural and functional assays to demonstrate that Black Sea Bass (BSB) PyV-LTA is transported into the nucleus by the Importin (IMP)/{beta}1 heterodimer thanks to the recognition of a bipartite cNLS located downstream of the SF3 helicase domain, rather than between the LXCXE motif and the OBD. Such cNLS binds with high affinity to several IMP isoforms by simultaneously interacting with the minor and major binding sites. Substitution of NLS key basic residues abrogating binding to IMP, or co-expression with the well characterized IMP/{beta}1 inhibitor Bimax2 suppressed nuclear localization. Intriguingly a cNLS could be identified in a similar position in LTAs from other PyVs infecting ray-finned fishes, but not cartilaginous fishes, birds or scorpions, where cNLSs were predicted elsewhere. Our study suggests that LTAs from PyVs infecting different non-mammalian hosts might bear cNLS in distinctive positions, possibly reflecting processes of virus-host adaptation."
"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPR) is tuned by the balance between unfolded proteins and chaperones. While reserve chaperones are known to suppress the UPR transducers via their stress-sensing luminal domains, the underlying structural mechanisms remain unclear. Cellular and biophysical analyses established that the ER chaperone AGR2 forms a repressive complex with the luminal domain of the UPR transducer IRE1{beta}. Structural prediction, X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy identify critical interactions between an AGR2 monomer and a regulatory loop in IRE1{beta}s luminal domain.

However, in the repressive complex it is an AGR2 dimer that binds IRE1{beta}. Cryo-EM reconstruction reveals a mechanism of unanticipated simplicity: one AGR2 protomer engages the regulatory loop, while the second asymmetrically binds IRE1{beta}s luminal domains C-terminus, blocking IRE1{beta}-activating dimerization.

Molecular dynamic simulations indicate that the second, disruptive AGR2 protomer exploits rare fluctuations in the IRE1{beta} dimer that expose its binding site. Thus, AGR2 actively disrupts IRE1{beta} dimers to suppress the UPR, while chaperone clients compete for AGR2 to trigger UPR signalling"
"Antigen-specific regulation of T cell response is crucial for limiting hyperimmune response. In this study, we discovered that antibodies specific to the antigen peptide-MHC class II complex are produced during helper T cell responses to various antigens. These antibodies specifically inhibited T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of MHC class II molecules presenting specific antigen peptide. We have termed these antibodies  immuneinduced TCR-like antibodies (iTabs). Immunization with peptides containing flanking residues induced iTabs, whereas immunization with peptides lacking flanking residues did not. Furthermore, immunization of iTab-inducible peptide as well as iTab treatment suppressed autoimmune disease development. Our findings provide a strategy for suppressing antigen-specific helper T cell responses using specific peptides, potentially controlling autoimmune diseases."
"The de novo purine synthesis pathway is fundamental for nucleic acid production and cellular energetics, yet the role of mitochondrial metabolism in modulating this process remains underexplored. In many cancers, metabolic reprogramming supports rapid proliferation and survival, but the specific contributions of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes to nucleotide biosynthesis are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that the TCA cycle enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is essential for maintaining optimal de novo purine synthesis in normal and cancer cells. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SDH markedly attenuates purine synthesis, leading to a significant reduction in cell proliferation. Mechanistically, SDH inhibition causes an accumulation of succinate, which directly impairs the purine biosynthetic pathway. In response, cancer cells compensate by upregulating the purine salvage pathway, a metabolic adaptation that represents a potential therapeutic vulnerability. Notably, co-inhibition of SDH and the purine salvage pathway induces pronounced antiproliferative and antitumoral effects in preclinical models. These findings not only reveal a signaling role for mitochondrial succinate in regulating nucleotide metabolism but also provide a promising therapeutic strategy for targeting metabolic dependencies in cancer."
"Recent studies have shown that sensory rhythmic stimulation can enhance executive functions by synchronizing, entraining, oscillations within higher-order cortical networks. However, whether this entrainment extends to subcortical structures and shapes human behavior remains unclear. In a first experiment, we used intracranial EEG recordings in epileptic patients during a visual search task. While neutral stimulation induced moderate entrainment, we demonstrated that 5 Hz negative-valence stimulation can significantly entrain theta oscillations in a widespread task-related cortico-subcortical network, with increased synchrony in the ventral visual stream, the hippocampus, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In a second behavioral experiment in healthy individuals, visual search performance improved under both stimulation conditions, but memory for target images, assessed through an additional recognition task, was significantly enhanced after negative stimulation. These findings unravel the role of valence in modulating subcortical brain activity and behaviors through rhythmic sensory stimulation and pave the way for its further application in clinical intervention."
"Research with BSL-4 viruses such as Ebola, Marburg, and Nipah presents significant challenges due to their high virulence and the stringent containment measures required. A major limitation in studying viral pathogenesis and developing therapeutic strategies is the absence of suitable animal models that accurately replicate human disease. In this context, 3D cell culture systems offer significant advantages over traditional 2D monolayer cultures, mimicking native physiological conditions including cell polarization and composition. Human airway organoids, derived from pluripotent or adult stem cells, closely replicate the structure and function of the human respiratory system, providing a relevant and accessible environment for studying viral replication and pathogenesis. In contrast to conventional cell lines, airway organoids enable investigation of virus-host interactions within a human tissue context, providing insights that are more directly translatable to human disease. In our study, we generated airway organoids from both clinical donor tissues and commercially available nasal epithelial cells and showed in comparative analyses with whole lung tissue that these organoids are comparable in terms of cell composition. Despite donor-specific variations due to genetic factors, airway organoids derived from different sources and donors exhibit a remarkably similar cellular make-up. We further demonstrated that organoids derived from nasal swabs can effectively replicate BSL-4 viruses, establishing them as a standardized 3D model for broader research applications and advancing our understanding of these pathogens, especially in the absence of reliable animal models.

Author SummaryThis study establishes human airway organoids as a robust model for investigating BSL-4 pathogens, such as Ebola, Marburg, and Nipah virus. Airway organoids represent reliable systems due to their ability to replicate the complexity of human respiratory epithelia and support viral infection. These organoids exhibit high susceptibility to these viruses, allowing for subsequent analysis of infection kinetics, immune evasion, and tissue-specific tropism within a controlled environment. This platform provides a powerful tool for antiviral testing and studying virus-host interactions, thus helping bridge critical gaps in high-containment virus research."
"The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is an eco-friendly control method that may prove effective against Bagrada hilaris, a pest native to India, Southeast Asia, and Middle and central Africa and reported as invasive in the southwestern USA, Hawaii, Mexico, South America, and two Mediterranean islands. This insect causes significant crop damage due to its intense feeding behavior and is currently managed almost exclusively with synthetic insecticides. In this context, SIT offers a promising alternative for controlling B. hilaris populations, provided that sufficient numbers of sterile males are continuously released. Based on this premise, we conducted a preliminary laboratory study to evaluate the overflooding ratio (OFR)--the proportion of non-irradiated to irradiated males required to suppress the populations fertility. We tested various OFRs (1:1, 1:2, 1:5, and 1:10), monitoring both the number of eggs laid and hatching rates. Our results show a significant decrease in fertility as the percentage of irradiated males increases. Among the ratios examined, 1:5 emerged as the most advantageous in terms of both reducing fertility and ease of application. Although further validation under field conditions is needed, our findings suggest that SIT could effectively contribute to an integrated management strategy for B. hilaris, reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides and supporting a more sustainable approach."
"Passerine birds are among the most diverse and species-rich groups of vertebrates, but the timescale of their evolution has been difficult to resolve with confidence. The fossil record of early passerines is relatively sparse and molecular-clock estimates of the passerine crown age have varied widely, with most previous studies relying on external fossil calibrations or assumptions relating to Gondwanan vicariance. In this study, we estimated the passerine evolutionary timescale by incorporating a set of 43 passerine fossils selected through a detailed assessment, while using a Bayesian tip-dating approach with the unresolved fossilized birth-death process. Our analyses ultimately place the passerine crown age in the Eocene, which largely closes the gap between molecular and palaeontological estimates of the passerine evolutionary timescale. Our date estimates are somewhat influenced by the prior probability density for the starting time of the diversification process. Through a simulation study, we show that the effect of the starting-time prior can be attenuated by the inclusion of morphological data for fossil and extant taxa. Overall, our study demonstrates that incorporating a curated, comprehensive set of fossils is effective in producing a well-resolved estimate of the passerine evolutionary timescale, while highlighting potential avenues for refining this estimate using Bayesian tip-dating analyses."
"All animals have outsourced about half of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids (AAs). We recently demonstrated that the loss of biosynthetic pathways for these outsourced AAs is driven by energy-saving selection. Paradoxically, these metabolic simplifications enabled animals to use costly AAs more frequently in their proteomes, allowing them to explore sequence space more freely. Based on these findings, we proposed that environmental AA availability and cellular respiration mode are the two primary factors determining the evolution of AA auxotrophies in animals. Remarkably, our recent analysis showed that bacterial AA auxotrophies are also governed by energy-related selection, thereby roughly converging with animals. However, bacterial AA auxotrophies are highly heterogeneous and scattered across the bacterial phylogeny, making direct ecological and physiological comparisons with the animal AA outsourcing model challenging. To better test the universality of our model, we focused on Bdellovibrionota and Myxococcota--two closely related bacterial phyla that, through aerobic respiration and a predatory lifestyle, best parallel animals. Here, we show that Bdellovibrionota, driven by energy-related selection, outsourced a highly similar set of AAs to those in animals. This sharply contrasts with Myxococcota, which exhibit far fewer AA auxotrophies and rarely show signatures of energy-driven selection. These differences are also reflected in Bdellovibrionota proteomes, which are substantially more expensive than those of Myxococcota. Finally, we found evidence that the expression of costly proteins plays a crucial role in the predatory phase of the Bdellovibrio life cycle. Together, our findings suggest that Bdellovibrionota, through their obligate predatory lifestyle, exhibit the closest analogy to the AA auxotrophy phenotype observed in animals. In contrast, facultative predation, as seen in Myxococcota, appears to substantially limit the evolution of AA auxotrophies. These cross-domain convergences strongly support the general validity of our AA outsourcing model."
"The anti-ageing response of Dietary Restriction (DR) is thought to be an ancient mechanistic response, reasoning from its phenotypic conservation in a wide range of organisms. However, DR is implemented using different diets and methods across species, and evidence for conservation at the mechanistic level remains limited. Here we tested the longevity and fecundity response to DR across eight different species of Drosophila using the same diets in a reaction norm framework. We confirm that DR is phenotypically conserved across Drosophila. Next, we used comparative transcriptomics across six species and found strongly concordant differential expression in response to DR (rs > 0.28, < 0.72, P < 0.0001). We studied the evolutionary history of the top concordantly differentially expressed orthologous genes and identified that the large majority of these genes are ""young"" genes and are Diptera specific. Our results indicate that large parts of the DR response are likely to be taxonomic specific, suggesting that the genetic basis of DR is not widely conserved. To validate this hypothesis we tested whether the 15 most conserved genes that change in transcription in response to DR using conditional in vivo RNAi. Surprisingly, we found that 12 out of 15 genes tested had a lifespan phenotype, with 9 extending lifespan. Five of these genes are related to cysteine metabolism implicating it in the mechanisms of DR, further suggesting physiological compensation to DR is ubiquitous and providing a possible biomedical target. Our findings suggest that while large parts of the DR response are taxonomically specific, some core mechanisms are conserved across divergent species. The comparative approaches we used here hold promise to identify shared mechanisms relevant to our own species and therefore ultimately anti-ageing interventions."
"The nocebo effect, the evil twin of the better-known placebo effect in which anticipation of harm causes that harm, is increasingly thought to be responsible for poor clinical outcomes. In humans, nocebo hyperalgesia (i.e., increased sensitivity to pain) is blocked by proglumide, a cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist. Yet the neural circuitry underlying nocebo hyperalgesia remains unidentified, largely due to lack of appropriate animal models. Independently, our two laboratories developed unique animal models of CCK-dependent nocebo hyperalgesia in which expectation of pain resulted from environmental or social cues. We find that both nocebo paradigms share a neural circuit involving CCK release from neurons projecting from the anterior cingulate cortex to the lateral periaqueductal gray. This pathway, which had not been previously recognized, could represent a promising target for therapeutic interventions in pain-related disorders.

One-Sentence SummaryPain expectations, whether environmentally conditioned or transmitted socially, share a neural circuit, with cholecystokinin (CCK) projections from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to the lateral periaqueductal gray (PAG) playing a pivotal role."
"The recovery of microbial genomes from large metagenomic datasets is a critical step for identifying uncultivated microbial populations and explaining their functional roles. This process requires metagenomic binning, which involves clustering assembled contigs into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). However, existing computational binning methods often fail to leverage contigs sequence context effectively. Most of them cannot incorporate taxonomic knowledge from external databases, and insufficient training data frequently limits the deep learning-based binning methods. To address these challenges, we propose CompleteBin, an innovative pretrained deep language model enhanced by dynamic contrastive learning. CompleteBin trains a pretrained deep language model using both long and short contigs and clusters the contigs based on their embeddings generated by the language model. This approach uniquely integrates the sequence context of contigs, incorporates taxonomic knowledge from external databases, and leverages unlimited data during training to significantly improve binning accuracy. Compared to state-of-the-art binning tools such as CONCOCT, MetaBAT2, SemiBin2, and COMEBin, CompleteBin achieves higher performance across both simulated datasets (CAMI I and II) and diverse real-world datasets, including ocean, plant, freshwater, and human fecal samples. On average, CompleteBin achieves a 39.7% improvement on simulated datasets and a 58.9% improvement on real-world datasets in terms of the number of near-complete MAGs when compared to the best-performing results of other binning methods. These results highlight CompleteBins robust capability to recover high-quality MAGs from long and short contigs, establishing it as a powerful tool for advancing metagenomic research. CompleteBin is open-source and available at https://github.com/zoubohao/CompleteBin."
"The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a type I membrane protein that mediates target cell recognition and membrane fusion. Its transmembrane domain (TMD) is usually considered a passive physical anchor that attaches the protein to the viral envelope. However, current knowledge of the dynamics and biogenesis of integral membrane proteins indicates that TMDs generally play key functions beyond membrane anchoring. Here, we explored the role of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein TMD during viral entry. To do so, we generated a series of amino acid substitutions and insertions within the hydrophobic core of the TMD and analyzed their impact on protein function. Our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is highly susceptible to changes in its TMD. Furthermore, the TMD sequence and structural parameters relevant for viral entry are distributed across the entire segment, albeit with a stronger implication of the N-terminal portion. The relative orientation of the regions before and after the TMD was also found to be relevant for particle entry. Finally, our results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein TMD can form homo-oligomers through a motif in which small residues are necessary."
"Tropicalization, the process by which tropical species expand their ranges poleward due to global ocean warming, is a prominent threat to Mediterranean marine ecosystems, challenging their effective management and conservation. The arrival of non-indigenous fish is exacerbated by the Suez Canal that allows Indo-Pacific species to enter the region from the Red Sea. While some non-indigenous species (NIS) have already changed the composition and function of native Mediterranean communities, many others continue to arrive but often go unnoticed without regular surveys or until they are strongly established. We conducted biodiversity surveys using underwater visual census (UVC), aqueous environmental DNA (eDNA) and sponge-derived eDNA (i.e., eDNA accumulated in sea sponge tissue) at two protected locations in Zakynthos, Greece. Seven NIS were detected by eDNA, but only one (dusky spinefoot, Siganus luridus) was detected with all three methods. The fish assemblages of the two locations could be distinguished based on both UVC and eDNA but not from sponge-derived eDNA data, perhaps given low filtration rates. Of the three methods, aqueous eDNA metabarcoding provided the most comprehensive species list including new NIS detected (with the red-toothed triggerfish, Odonus niger, and the houndfish, Tylosurus crocodilus, being the first and third record in the Mediterranean Sea, respectively). Our findings highlight the potential value of incorporating molecular methods into regular monitoring as early warning tools for detecting NIS in marine protected areas threatened by ocean warming."
"Mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd), either due to inherited or somatic mutation, is prevalent in colorectal cancer (CRC) and other cancers. While anti-PD-1 therapy is utilized in both local and advanced disease, up to 50% of MMRd CRC fail to respond. Using animal and human models of MMRd, we determined that interactions between MHC+ C1Q+ CXCL9+ macrophages and TCF+ BHLHE40+ PRF1+ T cell subsets are associated with control of MMRd tumor growth, during anti-PD-1 treatment. In contrast, resistance is associated with upregulation of TIM3, LAG3, TIGIT, and PD-1 expression on T cells, and infiltration of the tumor with immunosuppressive TREM2+ macrophages and monocytes. By combining anti-PD-1 with anti-LAG3/CTLA4/TREM2, up to 100% tumor eradication was achieved in MMRd CRC and remarkably, in >70% in MMRp CRC. This study identifies key T cell and macrophage subsets mediating the efficacy of immunotherapy in overcoming immune escape in both MMRd and MMRp CRC settings.

"Current single imaging modalities typically lack the ability to simultaneously offer detailed anatomical visualization and quantitative cellular information, which is crucial for evaluating and improving therapeutic efficacy. We developed a quad-modal imaging nanocomplex for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic particle imaging (MPI), computed tomography (CT), and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) within a single nanoplatform. The chemically engineered complex is composed of bovine serum albumin as biocompatible matrix, superparamagnetic iron oxide as MRI and MPI agents, and optoradiopaque bismuth sulfide as CT and MSOT agents. We demonstrate here its use for high-resolution, real-time, and quantitative in vivo imaging of mesenchymal stem cells transplanted in mouse brain. This versatile nanocomplex may find applications for monitoring cell transfer and cell transplantation in vivo using multiple imaging approaches."
"Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) are a powerful model for studying the neurobiology of social bonding, yet tools for region- and cell type-specific gene regulation remain underdeveloped in this species. Here, we present a lentivirus-mediated CRISPR activation and interference (CRISPRa/i) platform for somatic gene modulation in the prairie vole brain. This system enables non-mutagenic, titratable regulation of gene expression in the adult brain without germline modification. Our dual-vector system includes one construct expressing dCas9-VPR (CRISPRa) or dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 (CRISPRi) under a neuron-specific promoter, and a second construct delivering a U6-driven sgRNA alongside an EF1-driven mCherry reporter. We detail the design, production, and stereotaxic delivery of these tools and demonstrate their application by targeting four genes implicated in social behavior (Oxtr, Avpr1a, Drd1, Drd2) across two mesolimbic brain regions: the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum. Gene expression analyses confirmed robust, bidirectional transcriptional modulation for select targets, establishing proof of concept for CRISPRa/i in this non-traditional model. The dual-vector design is readily adaptable to other gene targets, cell types, and brain regions, and can be multiplexed to provide a flexible and scalable framework for investigating gene function in behaviorally relevant circuits. These advances represent the first successful implementation of somatic CRISPRa/i in prairie voles and expand the genetic toolkit available for this species."
"Cell migration is crucial for development and deregulation causes diseases. The Scar/WAVE complex promotes mesenchymal cell migration through Arp2/3 mediated lamellipodia protrusion. We previously discovered that all isoforms of Nance-Horan Syndrome-like 1 (NHSL1) protein interact directly with the Scar/WAVE complex and the NHSL1-F1 isoform negatively regulates Scar/WAVE-Arp2/3 activity thereby inhibiting 2D random cell migration. Here, we investigate the NHSL1-A1 isoform, which contains a Scar homology domain (SHD). The SHD in Scar/WAVE mediates the formation of the Scar/WAVE complex. We found that the SHD of NHLS1-A is sufficient for the formation of an NHSL1-A complex composed of the same proteins as the Scar/WAVE complex, but NHSL1-A replaces Scar/WAVE. NHSL1-A SHD recruits the NHSL1-A complex to lamellipodia, where also the Scar/WAVE complex resides. Scar/WAVE contains a WCA domain, which is phosphorylated by CK2 and recruits and activates the Arp2/3 complex to nucleate branched actin networks supporting lamellipodial protrusion. We identified a WCA domain in NHSL1 which interacts with the Arp2/3 complex. The NHSL1 WCA domain is phosphorylated by GSK3, and this increases the interaction with the Arp2/3 complex. In contrast to NHSL1-F1, the NHSL1-A complex promotes cell migration speed but not cell persistence via the Scar/WAVE complex and potentially via its WCA domain. In addition, the NHSL1-A complex is required for chemotaxis. Mechanistically, the NHSL1-A complex may increase lamellipodial Arp2/3 activity and lamellipodial speed while reducing lamellipodial persistence. Our findings reveal an additional layer of Arp2/3 complex control essential for mesenchymal cell migration highly relevant for development and disease."
"Brivaracetam (BRV) and levetiracetam (LEV) are antiseizure medications (ASMs) that target synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), while UCB1244283 acts as a positive allosteric modulator of these medications. The SV2A-BRV-UCB1244283 complex reveals how UCB1244283 allosterically enhances BRV binding by occupying an allosteric site near the primary binding site, preventing BRV dissociation. This allosteric site, formed by hydrophobic and uncharged residues, is a novel small-molecule binding site in SV2A. Structural analysis and mutagenesis suggest that an allosteric network between the primary and allosteric sites governs high-affinity ASM binding. UCB1244283 selectively binds SV2A over SV2B and SV2C, with specific mutations disrupting binding. The structure explains why UCB1244283 binding to SV2A selectively allows interaction with specific ASMs but not others due to steric hinderance. Structural comparison reveals that distinct conformational differences between the SV2A-BRV-UCB1244283 and other SV2A-ligand complexes, particularly in the transmembrane domain, influence binding at both sites. Future research will explore potential therapeutics targeting the allosteric site and their impact on SV2A regulation.

TeaserUCB1244283 enhances LEV and BRV binding to SV2A, revealing an allosteric site that could aid in developing targeted therapeutics."
"Socially-transmitted behavioural traits can, if they persist in a group of animals over time, give rise to locally-adapted phenotypes that can enhance survival. This capacity is widespread through the animal kingdom, and forms the foundation of cultural inheritance. While social learning is well-documented among insects, and particularly in social insects such as bumblebees, the extent to which such behaviours can spread beyond initial kin groups and persist over time remains largely unknown. String-pulling is a non-natural foraging behaviour where bees must manipulate a string to extract an out-of-reach artificial flower and collect a reward, and has previously shown to spread via social learning. However, this was demonstrated only in highly controlled paired-dyad settings, where interactions between bees were strictly limited. Here, we show that string-pulling can spread both within and between bumblebee colonies and persist over time, under previously-untested open diffusion conditions. These are of greater ecological validity compared with classical paired dyad paradigms, and involve the seeding of a manually-trained demonstrator into a group of naive conspecifics. From this single point of origin, string-pulling behaviour spread rapidly within original,  primary colonies. Once the behaviour was established in the primary colonies,  secondary colonies were introduced, and string-pulling was also acquired by these new foragers. Furthermore, string-pulling was acquired through individual trial-and-error learning by a small number of bees in control colonies, which lacked trained demonstrators. These results confirm and build upon previous findings in bumblebees, and contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that social learning enables animals to establish local behavioural adaptations in the absence of the computational power provided by large brains."
"Autophagosomes form from seed membranes that expand through bulk-lipid transport via the bridge-like lipid transporter ATG2. The origins of the seed membranes and their relationship to the lipid transport machinery are poorly understood. Using proximity labeling and a variety of fluorescence microscopy techniques, we show that ATG2A localizes to extra-Golgi ARFGAP1 puncta during autophagosome biogenesis. ARFGAP1 itself is dispensable during macroautophagy, but among other proteins associating to these membranes, we find that RAB1 is essential. ATG2A co-immunoprecipitates strongly with RAB1A, and siRNA-mediated depletion of RAB1 blocks autophagy downstream of LC3B lipidation, similar to ATG2A depletion. Further, when either autophagosome formation or the early secretory pathway is perturbed, ARFGAP1 and RAB1A accumulate at ectopic locations with autophagic machinery. Our results suggest that ATG2A engages a RAB1A complex on select early secretory membranes at an early stage in autophagosome biogenesis.

Significance StatementThis study elucidates the role of early secretory membranes in autophagosome biogenesis. The authors demonstrate that RAB1/ARFGAP1 positive membranes are essential to autophagy and are recruited to the phagophore assembly site at an early step of autophagosome biogenesis. These membranes interact with the bridge-like lipid transport protein ATG2A and are positive for LC3B and WIPI2, suggesting that RAB1 membranes are a direct source for autophagosome growth."
"Targeted protein degradation (TPD) is an emergent therapeutic strategy with the potential to circumvent challenges associated with targets unamenable to conventional pharmacological inhibition. Among TPD approaches, Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) have shown marked advancement with numerous candidates in clinical development. Despite their potential, most PROTACs utilize advanced small molecule inhibitors, inherently limiting the scope of this approach. More generally, the fraction of the proteome tractable to PROTAC-type strategies is unknown. Here, we describe a chemical proteomic strategy for the agnostic discovery of degradable human proteins in cells using a new class of bifunctional degrader molecules called ""AgnoTACs"". Proteome-wide screening of 72 AgnoTACs in human cells uncovered downregulation events spanning >50 functionally and structurally diverse proteins, most of which lack chemical probes. Our findings highlight the potential of function-biased chemical libraries coupled with proteomic profiling to discover degrader starting points as well as furnish a blueprint for expanding our understanding of the chemically degradable proteome."
"River embankments cover extensive areas in estuaries worldwide, yet their potential for pollinator conservation remains largely unexplored. Even more so than road verges, these embankments may offer widespread habitat for pollinators due to their size and sun-facing warm slopes. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of bee communities from 157 dike grasslands along the lower branches of the Meuse and Rhine rivers in the Netherlands in relation to vegetation composition and landscape characteristics. We encountered nearly half (156) of all Dutch bee species. Almost 10% of all individuals belonged to red-listed species, especially in early spring when we observed rich ground nesting bee communities with their associated kleptoparasites. Wild bee abundance and diversity increased with more flowering plant species present, but saturated at low flower species richness. This early saturation suggests that even modest conservation efforts could effectively alleviate floral resource limitation for pollinators. In contrast to the overall pattern, red-listed species occurrence increased with flower diversity without saturating effects and correlated stronger with landscape level factors. Together, these results highlight the unique conservational value of river embankments for wild bees and illustrate the unused potential at many dike grasslands worldwide."
"Multiplex assays of variant effect (MAVEs) allow the functional characterization of an unprecedented number of sequence variants in both gene regulatory regions and protein coding sequences. This has enabled the study of nearly complete combinatorial libraries of mutational variants and revealed the widespread influence of higher-order genetic interactions that arise when multiple mutations are combined. However, the lack of appropriate tools for exploratory analysis of this high-dimensional data limits our overall understanding of the main qualitative properties of complex genotype-phenotype maps. To fill this gap, we have developed gpmap-tools (https://github.com/cmarti/gpmap-tools), a python library that integrates Gaussian process models for inference, phenotypic imputation, and error estimation from incomplete and noisy MAVE data and collections of natural sequences, together with methods for summarizing patterns of higher-order epistasis and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques that allow visualization of genotype-phenotype maps containing up to millions of genotypes. Here, we used gpmap-tools to study the genotype-phenotype map of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, a motif that modulates binding of the 16S rRNA to the 5 untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs through base pair complementarity during translation initiation in prokaryotes. We inferred full combinatorial landscapes containing 262,144 different sequences from the sequences of 5,311 5UTRs in the E. coli genome and from experimental MAVE data. Visualizations of the inferred landscapes were largely consistent with each other, and unveiled a simple molecular mechanism underlying the highly epistatic genotype-phenotype map of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence."
"Emerging evidence suggests a complex interplay of environmental and genetic factors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development. Among these factors, compromised DNA repair plays a critical but incompletely understood role in lung tumorigenesis and concurrent lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD).

In this study, we investigated the interplay between cigarette smoke, DNA damage and repair, focusing on the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) protein Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group C (XPC). We found decreased XPC mRNA expression in most NSCLCs compared to subject-matched, non-cancerous lung. In non-cancerous bronchial epithelial cells, cigarette smoke decreased NER, increased total DNA damage and resultant apoptosis, each exacerbated by XPC deficiency. In contrast, lung cancer cells exhibit greater resilience to cigarette smoke, requiring higher doses to induce comparable DNA damage and apoptosis, and are less reliant on XPC expression for survival. Importantly, XPC protects against chromosomal instability in benign bronchial epithelial cells, but not in lung cancer cells. Our findings support a ""double hit"" mechanism wherein early decreased XPC expression and resultant aberrant DNA repair, when combined with cigarette smoke exposure, may lead to loss of non-malignant epithelial cells (as observed in COPD), and contributes to early NSCLC transition through altered DNA damage response."
"Aging is the primary risk factor for most neurodegenerative diseases, yet the cell-type-specific progression of brain aging remains poorly understood. Here, we developed human cell-type-specific transcriptomic aging clocks using high-quality single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from post mortem human prefrontal cortex tissue of 31 donors aged 18 - 94 years, encompassing 73,941 high-quality nuclei. We observed distinct transcriptomic changes across major cell types, including upregulation of inflammatory response genes in microglia from older samples. Aging clocks trained on each major cell type accurately predicted chronological age and remained robust in independent single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets, underscoring their broad applicability. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of cell-type-specific transcriptomic clocks to measure biological aging in the human brain and highlight potential mechanisms of selective vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases. We anticipate these clocks will serve as a basis for further studies in other brain regions and more diverse populations, ultimately advancing our understanding of age-related neurodegenerative processes at the single-cell level."
"Functional studies of host-microbe interactions benefit from natural model systems that enable exploration of molecular mechanisms at the host-microbe interface. Bioluminescent Vibrio fischeri colonize the light organ of the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and this binary model has enabled advances in understanding host-microbe communication, colonization specificity, in vivo biofilms, intraspecific competition, and quorum sensing. The hummingbird bobtail squid, Euprymna berryi, can be generationally bred and maintained in lab settings and has had multiple genes deleted by CRISPR approaches. The prospect of expanding the utility of the light organ model system by producing multigenerational host lines led us to determine the extent to which the E. berryi light organ symbiosis parallels known processes in E. scolopes. However, the nature of the E. berryi light organ, including its microbial constituency and specificity for microbial partners, have not been examined. In this report, we isolate bacteria from E. berryi animals and tank water. Assays of bacterial behaviors required in the host, as well as host responses to bacterial colonization, illustrate largely parallel phenotypes in E. berryi and E. scolopes hatchlings. This study reveals E. berryi to be a valuable comparative model to complement studies in E. scolopes.

IMPORTANCEMicrobiome studies have been substantially advanced by model systems that enable functional interrogation of the roles of the partners and the molecular communication between those partners. The Euprymna scolopes-Vibrio fischeri system has contributed foundational knowledge, revealing key roles for bacterial quorum sensing broadly and in animal hosts, for bacteria in stimulating animal development, for bacterial motility in accessing host sites, and for in vivo biofilm formation in development and specificity of an animals microbiome. Euprymna berryi is a second bobtail squid host, and one that has recently been shown to be robust to laboratory husbandry and amenable to gene knockout. This study identifies E. berryi as a strong symbiosis model host due to features that are conserved with those of E. scolopes, which will enable extension of functional studies in bobtail squid symbioses."
"We propose a method to generate additional dynamic omics trajectories which could support pathway analysis methods such as enrichment analysis, genetic programming, and machine learning. Using long short-term memory neural networks, we can effectively predict an organisms dynamic response to a stimulus based on an initial dataset with relatively few samples. We present both an in silico proof of principle, based on a model that simulates viral propagation, and an in vitro case study, tracking the dynamics of Aspergillus nidulans BrlA transcript in response to antifungal agent micafungin. Our silico experiment was conducted using a highly noisy dataset with only 25 replicates. This proof of principle shows that this method can operate on biological datasets, which often have high variance and few replicates. Our in silico validation achieved a maximum R2 value of approximately 0.95 on our highly noisy, stochastically simulated data. Our in vitro validation achieves an R2 of 0.71. As with any machine learning application, this method will work better with more data; however, both of our applications attain acceptable validation metrics with very few biological replicates. The in vitro experiments also revealed a novel paradoxical dose-response effect: transcriptional upregulation by Aspergillus nidulans BrlA is highest at an intermediate dose of 10 ng/mL and is reduced at both higher and lower concentrations of micafungin."

Host-microbiome interactions are crucial in maintaining physiological homeostasis and influencing disease progression. While traditional microbiome research, focused on microbial diversity and abundance, provided essential frameworks, the integration of multi-omics approaches established a far more comprehensive, systems-level understanding of microbiome functionality. However, significant methodological challenges in multi-omics data integration remain, including inconsistent sample coverage, heterogeneous data formats, and complex downstream analytical workflows. These challenges impact the reproducibility and reliability of results and underscore the critical requirement for developing standardized, systematic workflows. Thus, we developed the EasyMultiProfiler (EMP) workflow, a streamlined and efficient analytical framework for multi-omics data analysis. EMP provides a comprehensive infrastructure based on the SummarizedExperiment and MultiAssayExperiment classes, creating a unified framework for storing and analyzing omics data. The frameworks architecture comprises five interconnected functional modules: data extraction, preparation, support, analysis, and visualization. These modules are smoothly integrated into natural language-style analytical workflows, offering users an efficient and standardized solution for multi-omics analysis. EMP addresses critical challenges in multi-omics data analysis, including data integration, workflow standardization, and result reproducibility. The platforms modular architecture and intuitive interface provide researchers and clinicians with a robust, flexible workflow to systematically extract biologically relevant insights from complex multi-omics datasets."
"Marine plankton communities consist of numerous species, and their composition and physiological states are closely linked to ecosystem functions. Understanding biogeochemical cycles requires measuring taxon-specific mortality due to viral lysis or sloppy feeding, as the dissolved organic matter released contributes to rapid nutrient recycling and long-term carbon sequestration following microbial transformation. This study introduces a quantitative and comprehensive analysis of microeukaryotes in the dissolved constituents of seawater by using Mortality by Ribosomal Sequencing (MoRS) method. Our experimental pipeline successfully recovered 83% of cell-free rRNA. The ratio of cell-free rRNA to cell-associated rRNA was more than 10-fold higher in the mesopelagic layer than in the upper epipelagic layer, suggesting the mesopelagic zone as a hotspot for eukaryotic cell lysis. Many protist lineages, including phytoplankton such as haptophytes, are less susceptible to cell lysis in the epipelagic layer yet are actively lysed in the mesopelagic zone. Notably, over 86% of the significantly lysed species in the mesopelagic layer showed a habitat preference for the epipelagic layer. These findings indicate that sinking from the surface and lysis in the mesopelagic are prevalent dynamics for various eukaryotes."
"The aging process affects brain structure and function, yet its biomechanical properties remain underexplored. Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) provides a unique perspective by mapping brain tissue stiffness and damping ratio, observables that correlate with age and disease. Using a self-supervised contrastive regression framework, we demonstrate that MRE surpasses conventional structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in sensitivity. Specifically, stiffness captures Alzheimers disease (AD), while damping ratio detects subtle changes associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Our regional analysis identifies deep brain structures, particularly the caudate and thalamus, as key biomarkers of aging. The greater age sensitivity of MRE translates to superior differentiation of AD and MCI from healthy individuals, pinpointing regions where significant biomechanical alterations occur, notably the thalamus in AD and hippocampus in MCI. Furthermore, our results reveal biomechanical alterations in cognitively healthy individuals whose aging profiles closely resemble patients with MCI and AD. These findings highlight MREs potential as a biomarker for early neurodegenerative changes, aiding dementia risk detection and early intervention."
"BackgroundThe use of chorioallantoic membranes (CAM) route for the propagation of fowlpox virus (FPV) is the method applied in the production of potent and effective fowlpox vaccine at the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI), Vom. However, production insufficiency has led to inadequate supply of vaccine to meet farmers demands. This has left large number of susceptible and unvaccinated flocks with outbreaks of the disease being reported in Nigerian.

AimThis study adapted FPV to Chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cell culture and assessed its immunogenicity and safety of the resulting vaccine in comparison to a locally produced CAM-based FPV vaccine.

MethodsThe FPV were propagated on CAM and CEF of 9 to 12 day old developing chicken embryos. The vaccine harvests were subjected to quality checks, titrated, and used in vaccinating experimental birds via the wing web to monitor for takes, seroconversion, and safety.

ResultsThe FPV was successful adapted to CEF as demonstrated by the attainment of 80 to 90% cytopathic effect within 71 to 115 hours in the different passages. Both the CEF and CAM-adapted vaccine harvests were highly replicative producing titres of above 106.0/ml TCID50, but higher titres of 108.25/ml TCID50 was recorded in the CEF-adapted vaccines. Experimentally vaccinated birds showed 100% takes within 3 to 4 days post-vaccination, with no adverse effects recorded.

ConclusionThis research reported successful development and adaptation of FPV to CEF that was safe and immunogenic, with the potential for its use in the production of self-sufficiency vaccine for fowlpox prevention and control in poultry."
"The brain has long been conceptualized as a network of neurons connected by synapses. However, attempts to describe the connectome using established network science models have yielded conflicting outcomes, leaving the architecture of neural networks unresolved. Here, by performing a comparative analysis of eight experimentally mapped connectomes, we find that their degree distributions cannot be captured by the well-established random or scale-free models. Instead, the node degrees and strengths are well approximated by lognormal distributions, although these lack a mechanistic explanation in the context of the brain. By acknowledging the physical network nature of the brain, we show that neuron size is governed by a multiplicative process, which allows us to analytically derive the lognormal nature of the neuron length distribution. Our framework not only predicts the degree and strength distributions across each of the eight connectomes, but also yields a series of novel and empirically falsifiable relationships between different neuron characteristics. The resulting multiplicative network represents a novel architecture for network science, whose distinctive quantitative features bridge critical gaps between neural structure and function, with implications for brain dynamics, robustness, and synchronization."
"Accurate assessment of demographic parameters is crucial for conserving endangered species. The Greater One-horned Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), a sexually monomorphic species, lacks a validated molecular sexing protocol for diverse biological samples. This study established a multi-marker molecular sexing protocol using blood, tissue, horn, and dung samples from all wild populations in India. The optimized multiplex strategy that involves three sex-linked markers: ZF, AMESC, and TSRY, enabled simultaneous amplification of X-and Y-chromosome-specific fragments in degraded samples. Testing with 286 individual rhino samples from seven parks (5 blood, 180 tissue, seven horn, and 94 dung) led to a [~]92% (195 M: 69 F) success rate. Overall, this approach validates a molecular sexing protocol with increased reliability and fewer amplification failures, facilitating large-scale demographic studies. Future research should utilize this method to examine the sex ratio of all existing Indian rhino populations across their range, ensuring their future persistence and management."
"Predictive coding frameworks suggest that neural computations rely on hierarchical error minimization, where sensory signals are evaluated against internal model predictions. However, the neural implementation of this inference process remains unclear. We propose that cross-frequency coupling (CFC) furnishes a fundamental mechanism for this form of inference. We first demonstrate that our previously described Laminar Neural Mass Model (LaNMM) supports two key forms of CFC: (i) Signal-Envelope Coupling (SEC), where lowfrequency rhythms modulate the amplitude envelope of higher-frequency oscillations and (ii) Envelope-Envelope Coupling (EEC), where the envelopes of slower oscillations modulate the envelopes of higher-frequency rhythms. Then, we propose that, by encoding information in signals and their envelopes, these processes instantiate a hierarchical ""Comparator"" mechanism at the columnar level. Specifically, SEC generates fast prediction-error signals by subtracting top-down predictions from bottom-up oscillatory envelopes, while EEC operates at slower timescales to instantiate gating--a critical computational mechanism for precision-weighting and selective information routing. To establish the face validity and clinical implications of this proposal, we model perturbations of these CFC mechanisms to investigate their roles in pathophysiological and altered neuronal function. We illustrate how, in disorders such as Alzheimers disease, disruptions in gamma oscillations following dysfunction in fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons impact Comparator function with an aberrant amplification of prediction errors in the early stages and a drastic attenuation in late phases of the disease. In contrast, by increasing excitatory gain, serotonergic psychedelics diminish the modulatory effect of predictions, resulting in a failure to attenuate prediction error signals (c.f., a failure of sensory attenuation). Collectively, these findings implicate cross-frequency coupling across multiple temporal scales as a key computational mechanism supporting predictive coding and suggest that disruptions in these processes play a central role in disease.

HighlightsO_LIUsing an encoding scheme where information is encoded in signals, their envelopes, and envelopes of envelopes, we show how to implement prediction error and precision modulation in a neural mass model through cross-frequency coupling (CFC).
C_LIO_LIWe use the laminar neural mass model (LaNMM), which integrates Jansen-Rit and pyramidal interneuron gamma (PING) submodels to display fast and slow rhythms and provides mechanisms for a) Signal-Envelope Coupling (SEC), where slow-wave activity modulates the amplitude envelope of fast oscillations (analogous to phase-amplitude coupling), and b) Envelope-Envelope Coupling (EEC), where the envelopes of slower oscillations modulate the envelopes of higher-frequency rhythms.
C_LIO_LIWe show how to use the LaNMM to implement information-based prediction-error evaluation (as used in Active Inference and Kolmogorov Theory), computing the approximate precision-weighted difference between incoming sensory data (envelopes) and internal model predictions (signals or envelopes).
C_LIO_LIWe show that using these mechanisms, the Comparator mechanism can operate at multiple levels and timescales, generating fast prediction-error signals (via SEC) and slower gating signals that encode context (e.g., precision) (via EEC).
C_LIO_LIOur model provides insights into the physiological and cognitive consequences of mesoscale circuital alterations in the context of predictive coding. First, we study disorders of fast-spiking interneurons, such as Alzheimers Disease (AD). In the early stages of AD, error evaluation and precision are disrupted (inflated error and reduced gating/weight of predictions), leading to higher prediction errors. In later stages, prediction errors are suppressed regardless of predictions or their precision.
C_LIO_LIThen, we show how serotonergic psychedelics increase the effective weight of inputs and diminish that of predictions, resulting in higher prediction error signals.
C_LIO_LIThese observations link oscillatory mechanisms and predictive coding alterations, and potentially with the subjective phenomena in each condition--including cognitive decline in AD and hallucinatory states under psychedelics.

"Nova is a software library for the reading, writing, and management of mass spectrometry data natively in the C# language. It complements similar software libraries ubiquitously used in application development for C++, Python, and Java. Few software libraries and resources for mass spectrometry data analysis have been developed for C# relative to other languages. C#, however, remains the dominant language of choice for development of real time mass spectrometry (RTMS) analysis and instrument control applications, illustrating the need for native C# libraries when developing RTMS software. Nova provides fast, easy-to-use structures and classes built upon interfaces that support open community standards, and are easily extensible for current or future mass spectrometry software development needs."
"AimThe charred dry skin of the Four-toed Hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris) is used as traditional medicine to treat boils. This study was to validate the antimicrobial activity of ethanolic extract of charred dry skin of Atelerix albiventris against microorganisms implicated in boils and to determine the antioxidant activity of these extracts. We also aimed to assess if the ethanolic extract of the uncharred skin possesses comparable bioactivity to the charred sample.

MethodologyWell diffusion and broth dilution methods were used for the antimicrobial activity, recording the zone of inhibition, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Minimum Bactericidal/Fungicidal concentrations of the extracts and the controls. The antioxidant activity was determined by employing 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals scavenging and the Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) assays.

ResultsThe test results showed that the charred extracts possess significantly antimicrobial activity against the tested microbes than the uncharred samples. Against the fungus Candida albicans, the charred extract recorded a zone of inhibition of 19 mm at 50 mg/ml, while against the main boil-causing bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, the charred extract showed activity even at 25 mg/ml (10.7 mm) with the uncharred extract only becoming bioactive at 250 mg/ml concentration (14.7 mm). The DPPH scavenging activity showed that the IC50 is 133.40 {micro}g/ml for ascorbic acid, 210.43 {micro}g/ml for charred and 138.93 {micro}g/ml for the uncharred sample. On the other hand, the total antioxidant capacity of the charred sample was higher with Gallic Acid Equivalent Concentrations of 452.03 GAE mg/g as compared to the uncharred sample with 30.75 GAE mg/g.

ConclusionThe results of this study validate the traditional use of the skin of Atelerix albiventris for the treatment of boils in Ghana. The significantly higher antimicrobial and antioxidant activity exhibited by the extract of the charred sample over the uncharred also validates the method of preparation traditionally employed."
"Anti-termination factors for eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) that are released upon binding sequences in the terminator of nascent transcripts were proposed almost 40 years ago but few candidates have been found. Here we report genetic evidence that the yeast nuclear RNA-binding protein Hrp1, also known as Nab4 and CF1B, acts as an RNAP II anti-termination factor. A Lys to Glu substitution at residue 9 (K9E) of the Rpb3 subunit of RNAP II causes readthrough of Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1-dependent (NNS) terminators and cold-sensitive growth, as does Asp but not Ala, Met, Arg, or Gln substitution. These allele-specific phenotypes and the location of Rpb3-K9 suggests substitution with Glu or Asp stabilizes binding of an anti-termination factor via a salt bridge. A genome-wide selection for suppressors of the cold-sensitivity of Rpb3-K9E yielded an Arg to Gly substitution at residue 317 of Hrp1 in RNA recognition motif 2 (RRM2), consistent with the hypothesis. A targeted selection for suppressors of Rpb3-K9E in HRP1 yielded substitutions in RRMs 1 and 2, an essential Met- and Gln-rich region C-terminal to the RRMs, and other mutations. We propose that Hrp1 binds to the RNAP II elongation complex via these regions to promote elongation and, in the presence of Rpb3-K9E, is less rapidly released upon binding terminator sequences in the nascent transcript, resulting in terminator readthrough. The Rpb3-K9E-suppressor substitutions in Hrp1 likely weaken binding to the RNAP II elongation complex, compensating for Rpb3-K9E."
"Enhancers play critical roles in gene expression, but a full understanding of their complex functions has yet to be defined. The cellular response to excess zinc levels in C. elegans requires the HIZR-1 transcription factor, which binds the high-zinc activation (HZA) enhancer in the promoters of multiple target genes. Cadmium hijacks the excess zinc response by binding and activating HIZR-1. By analyzing the genome-wide transcriptional response to excess zinc and cadmium, we identified two positions in the genome where head-to-head oriented genes are both induced by metals. In both examples, a single predicted HZA enhancer is positioned between the two translational start sites. We hypothesized that a single enhancer can control both head-to-head genes, an arrangement that has not been extensively characterized. To test this hypothesis, we used CRISPR genome editing to precisely delete the HZAmT enhancer positioned between mtl-2 and T08G5.1; in this mutant, both head-to-head genes display severely reduced zinc-activated transcription, whereas zinc-activated transcription of more distant genes was not strongly affected. Deleting the HZAcF enhancer positioned between cdr-1 and F35E8.10 caused both head-to-head genes to display reduced cadmium-activated transcription, whereas cadmium-activated transcription of more distant genes was not strongly affected. These studies rigorously document that a single HZA enhancer can control two head-to-head genes, advancing our understanding of the diverse functions of enhancers.

Article SummaryEnhancers are critical for gene expression, but a full understanding their functions has yet to be elucidated. We discovered two positions in the C. elegans genome where a pair of head-to-head oriented genes are both transcriptionally activated by excess zinc and/or cadmium; in both cases, one high-zinc activation (HZA) enhancer is positioned between the translation start sites. When these HZA enhancers were deleted by genome engineering, both head-to-head genes lost metal-activated transcription. These results demonstrate that a single HZA enhancer can control two head-to-head genes, advancing the understanding of enhancer function."
"Phylogenies contain a wealth of information about the evolutionary history and process that gave rise to the diversity of life. This information can be extracted by fitting phylogenetic models to trees. However, many realistic phylogenetic models lack tractable likelihood functions, prohibiting their use with standard inference methods. We present phyddle, pipeline-based software for performing phylogenetic modeling tasks on trees using likelihood-free deep learning approaches. phyddle has a flexible command-line interface, making it easy to integrate deep learning approaches for phylogenetics into research workflows. phyddle coordinates modeling tasks through five pipeline analysis steps (Simulate, Format, Train, Estimate, and Plot) that transform raw phylogenetic datasets as input into numerical and visual model-based output. We conduct three experiments to compare the accuracy of likelihood-based inferences against deep learning-based inferences obtained through phyddle. Benchmarks show that phyddle accurately performs the inference tasks for which it was designed, such as estimating macroevolutionary parameters, selecting among continuous trait evolution models, and passing coverage tests for epidemiological models, even for models that lack tractable likelihoods.

"Understanding how plants distinguish between commensal and pathogenic microorganisms is one of the major challenges in the plant microbe interaction research. We previously identified a gene encoding CYP71A27 connected to camalexin, which is necessary for a plant growth promoting (PGP) activity of a number of bacterial strains. To dissect its function, we compared multilevel responses in roots of wild type Arabidopsis and the cyp71A27 mutant to two bacterial strains, a PGP Pseudomonas fluorescens CH267 and a pathogen Burkholderia glumeae PG1. We show that incubation with these bacteria leads to significant and distinct transcriptional reprogramming. This is accompanied by a proteome remodelling in both shoots and roots and profound changes in accumulation of many metabolites, primarily sugars, amino acids, and TCA cycle intermediates, but also by alterations in the ionome. We then analysed the mutant cyp71a27 and identified number of genes and proteins differently regulated, particularly after interaction with the PGP strain, but only a very mild impact of the mutation on root metabolites and exudates. We analysed a variety of mutants in genes differentially regulated by Pseudomonas sp. CH267 in cyp71a27 and revealed that their response to this PGP bacterial strain is similar to cyp71a27. Thus, it seems that CYP71A27 is a non-canonical P-450 without a metabolic function but active in signalling pointing to a regulatory role of the CYP71A27 gene, particularly in interaction with a plant growth promoting bacteria."
"Standard antibiotic susceptibility tests (ASTs) often fail to accurately predict treatment outcomes because they do not account for biofilm-specific mechanisms of reduced susceptibility. In the present study, we explored alternative approaches to predict tobramycin susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms that were experimentally evolved in physiologically relevant conditions. To this end, we used four analytical methods - whole-genome sequencing (WGS), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) and multi-excitation Raman spectroscopy (MX-Raman). Machine learning models were trained on data outputs from these methods to predict tobramycin susceptibility of our evolved strains and subsequently validated with a collection of clinical isolates. For minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) predictions of the evolved strains, the highest accuracy{+/-}1 was achieved with MALDI-TOF MS (97.83 %), while for biofilm prevention concentration (BPC) predictions, Raman spectroscopy performed best with an accuracy{+/-}1 of 80.43 %. Overall, all analytical methods demonstrated comparable predictive performance, showing their potential for improving biofilm AST."
"Structural variation, involving large alterations in chromosome structure, drives genetic diversification and the emergence of new phenotypes. These changes are widespread in natural populations and play an important role in adaptation and speciation. For many species, research has been limited to laboratory adapted strains and experimental evolution, which may not reflect the diversity of structural variants in the wild. Furthermore, technological limitations have proved to be a major barrier to accurate and comprehensive variant calling. In this study, we used PacBio sequencing data from 14 wild Caenorhabditis elegans strains to characterize structural variants in a natural population. With long-reads, we overcame limitations associated with short-read approaches and leveraged population-level data to further refine the accuracy of variant calls. We found that large, rapidly evolving gene families, such as GPCR, F-Box, and C-Type lectin, were prominent among the variants predicted to have phenotypic consequences. These results shed light on the significant role of structural variants in the evolution of Caenorhabditis elegans in its wild habitats and the limitations of treating N2 as the reference wild-type."
"Potyviridae is the largest family of plant-infecting RNA viruses. All members of the family (potyvirids) have positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes, with polyprotein processing as the main expression strategy. The 5-proximal regions of their genomes encode two types of leader proteases: the serine protease P1 and the cysteine protease HCPro. However, their arrangement and sequence composition vary greatly among genera or even species. The leader proteases play multiple important roles in different potyvirid-host combinations, including RNA silencing suppression and virus transmission. Here, we report that viruses in the genus Arepavirus, which encode two HCPro leader proteases in tandem (HCPro1-HCPro2), can naturally lose the coding sequences for these two proteins during infection. Notably, this loss is associated with a shift in foliage symptoms from severe necrosis to mild chlorosis or even asymptomatic infections. Further analysis revealed that the deleted region is flanked by two short repeated sequences in the parental isolates, suggesting that recombination during virus replication likely drives this genomic deletion. Reverse genetic approaches confirmed that the loss of leader proteases weakens RNA silencing suppression and other critical functions. A field survey of areca palm trees displaying varied symptom severity identified a transitional stage in which full-length viruses and deletion mutants coexist in the same tree. Based on these findings, we propose a scenario in which full-length isolates drive robust infections and facilitate plant-to-plant transmission, eventually giving rise to leader protease-less variants that mitigate excessive damage to host trees, allowing long-term coexistence with the perennial host. To our knowledge, this is the first report of potyvirid self-attenuation via coding sequence loss.

Author summaryPlant viruses typically persist throughout the lifespan of their host plants, employing multiple strategies to ensure long-term survival. This study reveals an unusual self-attenuation mechanism in which potyvirids, likely through recombination, discard a large genomic fragment containing the RNA silencing suppressor coding sequence. This deletion reduces viral pathogenicity, enabling a peaceful long-term virus-plant coexistence. Meanwhile, the attenuated viruses may function as natural vaccines, protecting plants from reinfection by the full-length pathogenic strains or related variants. These findings highlight a direct link between viral evolution and long-term coexistence, suggesting that such adaptations may promote mutual benefits. Understanding these dynamics could provide valuable insights into virus-host interactions and inspire new approaches to plant disease management."
"Accurate classification of somatic variations from high-throughput sequencing data has become integral to diagnostics and prognostics across various cancers. However, the classification of these variations remains highly manual, inherently variable, and largely inaccessible outside specialized laboratories. Here, we introduce Azurify - a computational tool that integrates machine learning, public resources recommended by professional societies, and clinically annotated data to classify the pathogenicity of variations in precision cancer medicine. Trained on over 15,000 clinically classified variants from 8,202 patients across 138 cancer phenotypes, Azurify achieves 99.1% classification accuracy for concordant pathogenic variants in data from two external clinical laboratories. Additionally, Azurify reliably performs precise molecular profiling in leukemia cases. Azurifys unified, scalable, and modular framework can be easily deployed within bioinformatics pipelines and retrained as new data emerges. In addition to supporting clinical workflows, Azurify offers a high-throughput screening solution for research, enabling genomic studies to identify meaningful variant-disease associations with greater efficiency and consistency."
"In Alzheimers disease (AD), tau pathology accumulates gradually throughout the brain, with clinical decline reflecting tau progression. A comprehensive understanding of, first, whether tau propagation is predominantly governed by connectome-based diffusion, regional vulnerability, or an interplay of both, and second, which types of brain connectivity or regional factors best explain tau propagation, remains crucial for advancing our understanding of AD progression. Here, we apply multi-scale mechanistic disease progression simulations to human data, to disentangle the influence of local mechanisms on global tau progression patterns in AD. We find that whether tau reaches a brain region (presence) and how much tau accumulates there (load) are governed by different mechanisms. Tau presence patterns are highly consistent across the population, and can be largely explained through synaptic spread through white-matter networks and excitatory-inhibitory dynamics. Meanwhile tau load differs across people, and is driven by a combination of synaptic spread and intrinsic or extrinsic regional properties, including regional {beta}-amyloid load, MAPT gene expression and regional blood flow. Finally, while distinct tau patterns in the population could each be explained by established AD mechanisms, our models highlight a role of distinct brain networks (parietal functional networks in MTL-sparing AD tau subtype) and neurotransmitter systems (cholinergic system in posterior subtype). Together, this work suggests that network dynamics likely determine the sequence of regional tau progression, while individual-specific tissue-vulnerability factors influence regional tau load."
"The level of cellular organization bridging the mesoscale and whole-cell scale is coming into focus as a new frontier in cell biology. Great progress has been made in unraveling the complex physical and functional interconnectivity of organelles, but how the entire organelle network is spatially arranged within the cytoplasm is only beginning to be explored. Drawing on cross-disciplinary research synthesis methods, we systematically curated the whole-cell volumetric imaging literature, resulting in a corpus consisting of 89 studies and 118 image datasets. We describe the trajectory and current state of the field between 2004 and 2024. A broad characterization, or ""scoping review"", of bibliometrics, study design, and reporting practices shows accelerating technological development and research output. We find high variability in study design and reporting practices, including imaging modality, model organism, cellular contexts, organelles imaged, and analyses. Due to the laborious, low-throughput nature of most volumetric imaging methods, we find trends toward small sample sizes (<10 cells) and small cell types. We describe common quantitative analyses across studies, including volumetric ratios of organelles and inter-organelle contact analyses. This work establishes the initial iteration of a growing dataset of whole-cell imaging literature and data, and motivates a call for standardized whole-cell imaging study design, reporting, and data sharing practices in the context of an emerging sub-field of cell biology. Our curated dataset now provides the basis for a plethora of future aggregate and comparative analyses to reveal larger patterns and generalized hypotheses about the systems behavior and regulation of whole-cell organelle networks. More broadly, we showcase the potential of new rigorous secondary research methods to strengthen cell biologys literature review and reproducibility toolkit, create new avenues for discovery, and promote open research practices that support secondary data-reuse and integration."
"Mammals utilize imprinted and X-linked epigenetic mechanisms in development, metabolism, and behavior. Imprinted genes, including Prader-Willi syndrome Snord116 noncoding RNAs, are implicated in the regulation of sleep and circadian rhythms through poorly understood mechanisms. Utilizing mouse models of Snord116 deficiency and overexpression, we performed an integrated, sex-stratified analysis of free running behaviors, indirect calorimetry, and cortical transcriptomes following entrainment to a 22 hour light:dark T-cycle. We observed significant interactions of sex, entrainment, and Snord116 genotype in period length at baseline and after-effects of post-entrainment. Snord116 deletions effect on respiratory exchange ratio was light sensitive, with sex and entrainment effects dominant under total darkness. Snord116 genotype impacted both rhythmic and non-rhythmic cortical gene networks that integrated sex, light, and entrainment effects with genotype-phenotype correlations. A co-expressed gene network enriched for imprinted, Snord116-target, and Xist-proximal long noncoding RNAs was identified as a light-sensitive regulatory hub of sexual dimorphic responses to a dynamic environment."
"Understanding how cells build and organize their internal structures is a fundamental question in biology, with important implications for human health and disease. Trypanosomes are single-celled flagellated parasites that cause life-threatening diseases in human and animals. Their survival relies on a specialized compartment called the flagellar pocket (FP), which serves as a gateway for nutrient uptake, and immune evasion. The formation and function of the FP are supported by an intricate cytoskeletal structure known as the flagellar pocket collar (FPC). However, the mechanisms underlying its assembly remain poorly understood.

In this study, we used cutting-edge ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) to investigate FPC biogenesis in Trypanosoma brucei. We mapped the formation of the new microtubule quartet (nMtQ) alongside flagellum growth, providing new insights into its assembly. Additionally, we tracked the localization dynamics of key structural proteins - BILBO1, MORN1, and BILBO2 - during the biogenesis of the FPC and the hook complex (HC). Notably, we identified two previously undetected structures: the proFPC and the transient FPC-interconnecting fibre (FPC-IF), both of which appear to play crucial roles in linking and organizing cellular components during cell division.

By uncovering these novel aspects of FPC biogenesis, our study significantly advances the understanding of cytoskeletal organization in trypanosomes and opens new avenues for exploring the functional significance of these structures."
"Adenosine is essential to energy metabolism and neuromodulation in the central nervous system. The retina is a highly energy-demanding neural tissue, and dysregulation of adenosine signaling causes retinal diseases. However, the dynamics of ecto-5-nucleotidase (CD73), a key enzyme for extracellular adenosine generation, remain elusive. Here, we investigate its spatiotemporal profile from development to adulthood using two transgenic mouse lines. We found that CD73 is transiently expressed in the early astrocyte lineage (Embryonic day 16.5 to Postnatal day [P] 3), becomes prominent in the rod-photoreceptor lineage by P3, and appears in the inner nuclear layer from P7 onward. CD73 deletion delays rod-response recovery and shortens the implicit time in scotopic ERG under dim light. These findings indicate that light and other physiological cues influence CD73 expression, which has significant consequences for retinal function, thereby providing a foundation for exploring disease-related alterations in CD73 and designing therapies that restore adenosine homeostasis."
"Although avoidance can serve an adaptive function in daily life, excessive or persistent avoidance can form a debilitating symptom of anxiety-related disorders. The transition from adaptive to maladaptive avoidance remains poorly understood, but stress is a potential contributing factor. We investigated the effects of chronic restraint stress on two active avoidance procedures: two-way active avoidance (2WAA) and platform-mediated avoidance (PMA). Whereas 2WAA entails a low-cost response, avoidance in the PMA task comes with a cost, i.e., no access to food. We hypothesized that chronic restraint stress would hinder avoidance acquisition in the 2WAA task, but increase avoidance acquisition in the PMA task. In two experiments, male and female rats underwent either chronic restraint stress or a control procedure. In Experiment 1, all rats (N = 31) were then trained in a 2WAA acquisition and extinction procedure, in two contexts. Stressed rats showed significantly reduced avoidance acquisition, while extinction was unaffected. In Experiment 2 (N = 32), stressed rats and controls were trained in a PMA acquisition and extinction procedure. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find effects on avoidance acquisition, although we found group and sex differences in lever press suppression. All rats gradually extinguished defensive behaviors during extinction. Overall, chronic restraint stress had limited effects on PMA, but significantly impaired avoidance acquisition in the 2WAA task without affecting its extinction. These divergent effects may relate to differences in response cost or differences in safety of the context (i.e., a permanent safe area in PMA, but not in 2WAA).

"Although the adult pentaradial body plan of echinoderms evolved from a bilateral ancestor, identifying axial homologies between the morphologically divergent echinoderms and their bilaterian relatives has been an enduring problem in zoology. The expression of conserved bilaterian patterning genes in echinoderms provides a molecular framework for resolving this puzzle. Recent studies in juvenile asteroids suggest that the bilaterian antero-posterior axis maps onto the medio-lateral axis that is perpendicular to each of the five rays of the pentaradial body plan. Here we test this hypothesis in another echinoderm class, the ophiuroids, using the cosmopolitan brittle star Amphipholis squamata. Our results show that the general principles of axial patterning are similar to those described in asteroids, and comparisons with existing molecular data from other echinoderm taxa support the idea that medio-lateral deployment of the AP patterning program across the rays predates the evolution of the asterozoan and likely the echinoderm crown-groups. Our data also reveal expression differences between A. squamata and asteroids, which we attribute to secondary modifications specific to ophiuroids. Together, this work provides important comparative data to reconstruct the evolution of axial properties in echinoderm body plans."
"Sensory neurons drive animal behaviors by detecting environmental stimuli and relaying information to downstream circuits. Beyond their primary roles in sensing, these neurons often form additional synaptic connections outside their main sensory modality, suggesting broader contributions to behavior modulation. Here, we uncover an unexpected role for the thermosensory neuron AFD in coupling tactile experience to locomotion modulation in Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that while AFD employs cGMP signaling for both thermotaxis and tactile-dependent modulation, the specific molecular components of the cGMP pathway differ between these two processes. Interestingly, disrupting the dendritic sensory apparatus of AFD, which is essential for thermotaxis, does not impair tactile-based locomotion modulation, indicating that AFD can mediate tactile-dependent behavior independently of its thermosensory apparatus. In contrast, ablating the AFD neuron eliminates tactile-dependent modulation, pointing to an essential role for AFD itself, rather than its sensory dendritic endings. Further, we find tactile-dependent modulation requires the AIB interneuron, which connects AFD to touch circuits via electrical synapses. Removing innexins expressed in AFD and AIB abolishes this modulation, while re-establishing AFD-AIB connections with engineered electrical synapses restores it. Collectively, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized function of AFD beyond thermosensation, highlighting its influence on context-dependent neuroplasticity and behavioral modulation through broader circuit connectivity."
"Biomolecular condensates regulate cellular physiology by sequestering and processing RNAs and proteins, yet how these processes are locally tuned within condensates remains unclear. Moreover, in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), condensates undergo liquid-to-solid phase transitions, but capturing early intermediates in this process has been challenging. Here, we present a surface multi-tethering approach to achieve intra-condensate single-molecule tracking of fluorescently labeled RNA and protein molecules within liquid-like condensates. Using RNA-binding protein Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) as a model for condensates implicated in ALS, we discover that RNA and protein diffusion is confined within distinct nanometer-scale domains, or nanodomains, which exhibit unique connectivity and chemical environments. During condensate aging, these nanodomains reposition, facilitating FUS fibrilization at the condensate surface, a transition enhanced by FDA-approved ALS drugs. Our findings demonstrate that nanodomain formation governs condensate function by modulating biomolecule sequestration and percolation, offering insights into condensate aging and disease-related transitions."
"Competition for food and reproductive interference (negative interspecific sexual interactions) have been identified as major drivers of species exclusion. Still, how these biotic interactions jointly determine competitive dominance remains largely unknown. We tackle this by coupling population models and laboratory experiments with two sibling species of spider mites. Using experiments specifically designed to measure the single and combined effects of food competition and reproductive interference, we first show that the strength and symmetry of reproductive interference between species changes in presence of food competition. Next, we show that population models incorporating each type of interaction alone lead to markedly different predictions, from exclusion of the inferior competitor for food, to priority effects instead favouring the latter under the sole effect of reproductive interference. Moreover, accounting for the observed reduction in the strength of reproductive interference in the presence of food competition changes the threshold frequency determining the dominant competitor when both interactions are at play, from equal chances for the two species to exclude the other depending on their initial frequency, to favouring the superior competitor for food except when it is extremely rare. Finally, we showed that the model generates accurate predictions for population dynamics in an independent population cage experiment, indicating that our approach captures the most relevant processes governing the outcome of interactions between competing spider mite species. Altogether, our results suggest that trophic interactions can modulate sexual interactions, significantly impacting population dynamics and competitive outcomes. Hence, the joint consideration of food competition and reproductive interference is critical to accurately predict and understand species coexistence."
"Identifying the neural correlates of consciousness remains a major challenge in neuroscience, requiring theories that bridge between subjective experience and measurable neural correlates. However, theoretical interpretation of empirical evidence is often post hoc and susceptible to confirmation bias. Building upon the adversarial collaboration mediated by the COGITATE Consortium, we present a generalizable approach for the data-driven identification, evaluation, and theoretical modeling of connectivity-based neural correlates of consciousness. Using the same magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset and accompanying pre-registered hypotheses from the COGITATE Consortium, we systematically compared 246 functional connectivity (FC) measures between regions predicted to underlie conscious vision by Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and/or Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT). We identified a family of FC measures based on the barycenter--tracking the  center of mass between two signals--as the top-performing stimulus decoding measures that generalize across regions central to predictions of both IIT and GNWT. To interpret these findings within a theoretical framework, we developed neural mass models that recapitulate the neural dynamics hypothesized to underlie conscious perception by each theory. Comparing simulated barycenter values from these models against empirically measured MEG data revealed that the GNWT-based model, featuring delayed ignition dynamics, better captured observed connectivity patterns than the IIT-based model, which relied on highly synchronized sensory dynamics. Beyond dataset-specific conclusions and limitations, we introduce a framework for systematically identifying and testing candidate neural correlates of consciousness in an unbiased and interpretable manner."
"Although neuronal hyperexcitability is the primary mechanism underlying seizure activity in epilepsy, little is known about how different neuronal mechanisms at different organizational levels contribute to network hyperexcitability in the human epileptic brain. In this study, we determined a series of cellular and synaptic properties of layer V pyramidal neurons from neocortical tissue of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy that may contribute the hyperexcitable state associated with epilepsy. Using the whole cell, patch-clamp technique, and extracellular recordings, we determined the passive and active electrophysiological properties of layer V pyramidal neurons with regular spiking phenotypes from temporal, parietal, and frontal neocortices surgically resected from individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy. Also, the glutamatergic strength, the synchronicity between presynaptic volleys and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials, and short-term, frequency-dependent plasticity were determined at the synaptic level. Lastly, biocytin-filled pyramidal neurons were used to perform post hoc digital reconstructions and morphometric analyses. The collected data revealed that pyramidal neurons exhibit minimal spontaneous activity, similar resting membrane potentials, and input resistance values among the temporal, parietal, and frontal neocortices. Although frontal neurons were more hyperexcitable than temporal and parietal neurons, the firing output was comparable to that previously observed in non-pathological human tissue. The digital reconstructions confirmed the identity of pyramidal neurons and revealed alterations in dendritic complexity. In contrast, the analyses of the extracellular recordings uncovered significant desynchronization between presynaptic excitability and postsynaptic activity and loss of short-term depression in response to repetitive stimulation within the gamma range (30 Hz). Our data suggest that neocortical layer V pyramidal neurons from individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy are not necessarily hyperexcitable at the somatic level. Instead, synaptic alterations, such as synaptic desynchronization and a loss of frequency-dependent short-term depression may significantly contribute to the hyperexcitable state observed during seizure activity."
"Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive brain tumors. Despite the standard therapy, the survival from diagnosis remains dramatically low, especially due to relapses. Considering their capacity to escape the tumor and to migrate to the subventricular zone through a CXCR4-dependant mechanism, Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) are considered as responsible for these relapses. CXCR4 regulates biological features associated with tumor progression, including self-renewal, migration and radio-resistance. Importantly, its expression correlates with severity and poor prognosis of several cancers including GBM. CXCR4/CXCL12 pathway appears therefore as an interesting potential therapeutic target. We have generated an oncolytic herpesvirus (oHSV) expressing HA-P2G, a mutated form of CXCL12 previously described as a CXCR4 competitive inhibitor. We demonstrate that in vitro, oHSV/P2G impairs human primary GSCs stemness markers expression, self-renewal and migration. In an orthotopic xenograft murine model, its injection within the tumor limits tumor growth and GSCs migration. The ability of P2G to interfere with major GSC features demonstrates the interest in considering oHSV/P2G as a promising new therapeutic approach for glioblastoma patients."
"Molecularly defined cortical cell types have recently been linked to whole neuronal morphology (WNM), particularly those characterized by whole-brain-wide projections, such as intratelencephalic (IT), extratelencephalic (ET), and corticothalamic (CT) neurons. In contrast, classical morphological classifications (e.g., tufted TPC, small tufted SPC, and stellate SSC) are based primarily on local dendrosomatic and axonal structures, especially apical dendrites. This study bridges these perspectives by establishing a new neuronal taxonomy, analyzing the connectomes of defined cortical cell types, and comparing them with those obtained from bulk anterograde injections. Neurons were sparsely labeled via tamoxifen-inducible Cre lines with GFP reporters, and 1,419 WNM cells were comprehensively reconstructed with Vaa3D-TeraVR from [~]15 areas across six functional regions of molecularly labeled brains imaged with 2p-fMOST. These cells were newly classified by integrating current molecular-WNM and classical morphological perspectives, with sample size augmented by 1,455 publicly available WNM cells reconstructed from the Mouse-Light project and CEBSIT. This effort defined ten combined molecular-WNM-classical morphological cell types: L5ET_TPC, L6CT_NPC, L6b_HPC, and seven IT types--L2/3IT_TPC, L4IT_SSC, L4IT_UPC, L4IT_TPC, L5IT_SPC, L6IT_IPC, and L6IT_car3PC. Clustering, quantitative analyses and random Forest classifier objectively validated these types and revealed their distinct connectomes, along with convergent, topographic, and hierarchical organizations across their projection brain regions. At the single-cell level, multiple organizational principles governing cortico-cortical (C-C) and cortico-subcortical (C-subC) connectomes emerged with unprecedented detail, offering a precise GPS-like tool for in vivo recordings and robust datasets for neuronal network modeling. Comparisons with bulk anterograde injection data underscored the limitations of traditional methods in identifying projection targets. Overall, our approach provides significant insights into cortical circuitry and elucidates the complex interplay between neuronal molecular identity, whole morphology, and classical morphological classification."
"Influenza A virus (IAV) exploits the host cellular machinery to facilitate its replication, yet many host-IAV interactions remain unexplored in the cellular context. Detailed information about interacting domains is also largely lacking. To address this, we employed in-cell cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to capture a vast network of protein-protein contact sites within IAV-infected human cells. This approach uncovered previously unrecognised host factors, delineated steps of the hemagglutinin maturation pathway, and revealed that IAV progressively disrupts paraspeckles. We further found that paraspeckle disruption is mediated by NP and NS1 interactions, PA-X activity, and inhibition of RNA polymerase II, thereby liberating RNA-binding proteins that enhance viral replication. Our work advances the understanding of IAV manipulation of host cellular processes and demonstrates the utility of in-cell XL-MS for comprehensive mapping of host-pathogen interactomes and infection pathways.

Highlights- In-cell cross-linking maps protein contact sites in IAV infection
- Steps of the hemagglutinin maturation pathway can be delineated by cross-linking
- IAV proteins interact with components of paraspeckles
- IAV disrupts paraspeckles releasing pro-viral host factors"
"The ketogenic diet (KD), characterized by high-fat, low-carbohydrate, and moderate protein intake, has gained attention for its therapeutic potential in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers disease. Studies in Alzheimers rodent models report that KD and/or ketogenic supplements attenuate cognitive-behavioral impairments, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta plaques and tau pathology. However, it is unknown whether KD can similarly benefit individuals with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a prevalent condition in which amyloid accumulates in cerebral vessels. CAA is highly comorbid in patients with Alzheimers and, on its own, increases the risk of stroke, cognitive impairment, and dementia, yet no effective treatments currently exist. The objective of this study was to determine whether KD can improve cognitive-behavioral and neuropathological outcomes in a mouse model with CAA. Male Tg-SwDI mice were fed either a standard chow or KD from 3.5 to 7.5 months of age. Following [~]3 months of dietary intervention, glucose and ketone-body levels were assessed, then mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests to evaluate locomotor activity, anxiety-related behaviors, and cognition. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess amyloid pathology, vascular density, neuroinflammation, white matter integrity, and hippocampal neurogenesis. In addition to KD inducing nutritional ketosis and achieving metabolic benefits, mice on KD exhibited increased activity, enhanced spatial learning and memory, and a trend toward improved spatial working memory. These cognitive benefits were accompanied by an attenuation of amyloid pathology and increased hippocampal neurogenesis. These findings suggest that a ketogenic diet may be safe and effective in Alzheimers and dementia patients with CAA."
"Asymmetric cell division (ACD) is a fundamental process to balance cell proliferation and differentiation during development and in the adult. Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a very small but highly malignant population within many human tumors, are able to provide differentiated progeny by ACD that contribute to the intratumoral heterogeneity, as well as to proliferate without control by symmetric, self-renewing divisions. Thus, ACD dysregulation in CSCs could trigger cancer progression. Here we consistently find low expression levels of RAP2A, the human homolog of the Drosophila ACD regulator Rap2l, in glioblastoma (GBM) patient samples, and observe that scarce levels of RAP2A are associated with poor clinical prognosis in GBM. Additionally, we show that restitution of RAP2A in GBM neurosphere cultures increases the ACD of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), decreasing their proliferation and expression of stem cell markers. Our results support that ACD failures in GSCs increases their spread, and that ACD amendment could contribute to reduce the expansion of GBM."
"Timothy syndrome (TS) is a multisystem disorder with autistic-like features, seizures and arrhythmia as the main symptoms. Most TS cases are caused by a de novo single amino acid substitution G406R in the CACNA1C gene that encodes the pore-forming subunit of the voltage-gated L-type calcium channel CaV1.2. We generated a zebrafish model of TS with a homologous amino acid substitution in the cacna1c-encoded protein. Unlike patients, heterozygous mutants showed only mild impairments with no changes in mortality. However, homozygous mutants showed increased mortality, arrhythmias, neural activity and sensitivity to pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure-like behavior. Mutants also exhibited microcephaly, cerebellar hypotrophy and abnormal development of GABAergic neuron populations, and transcriptomic analysis revealed dysregulated expression of neuropeptide genes (including bdnf and vgf). Consistent with the idea that CaV1.2 channels activate during fever, we found that heterozygous larvae manifested arrhythmia and seizure-like behavior when exposed to elevated environmental temperature, and homozygous larvae switched from bradycardia to tachycardia. These data provide a basis for using zebrafish to study the etiology of TS abnormalities and suggest t hat fever may be a particular risk for TS patients."
"For a number of viral pathogens, prolonged infections have been hypothesized to be the source of new variants that emerge and spread at the level of the host population. This potential role of prolonged infections has been highlighted most recently in the context of SARS-CoV-2, with variants of concern Alpha and Omicron likely to have evolved in immunocompromised individuals experiencing long-term viral infections. Analyses of sequenced viral samples from prolonged infections have indicated that there are several consistent patterns of evolution observed across these infections. These patterns include accelerated rates of nonsynonymous substitution, viral genetic diversification into distinct lineages, parallel substitutions across infected individuals, and heterogeneity in rates of antigenic evolution. Here, we use within-host model simulations to explore the drivers of these evolutionary patterns. Our simulations build on a tunably rugged fitness landscape model to first assess the role that mutations that impact only viral replicative fitness have in driving these patterns. They then further incorporate pleiotropic sites that jointly impact replicative fitness and antigenicity to assess the role that immune pressure has on these patterns. Through simulation, we find that the empirically observed patterns of viral evolution in prolonged infections cannot be robustly explained by viral populations evolving on replicative fitness landscapes alone. Instead, we find that immune pressure is needed to consistently reproduce the observed patterns. While our simulation models were designed to shed light on drivers of viral evolution in prolonged infections with respiratory viruses that generally cause acute infection, their structure can be used to better understand viral evolution in other acutely-infecting viruses such as noroviruses that can cause prolonged infection as well as viruses such as HIV that are known to chronically infect."
"Bioprospecting algae strains with tolerance to extreme conditions such as pH, temperature, salinity, and light is crucial for advancing biotechnology and environmental applications. However, traditional screening methods often involve significant costs and labor, restricting their accessibility and practical use. In this study, we developed and validated low-cost, high-throughput screening techniques, predominantly employing agar plates and liquid culture assays, to effectively differentiate tolerance levels among various algae strains. The methodologies were optimized using the model microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and its closely related species Chlamydomonas incerta and the recently discovered extremophilic Chlamydomonas pacifica. We systematically evaluated the algae for tolerance to extremes by establishing precise gradients of pH (acidic to alkaline conditions), salinity (0 to 5 M NaCl), temperature (34-42{degrees}C), and light intensity (40 to 2977 E{middle dot}m-{superscript 2}{middle dot}s-{superscript 1}). Our results demonstrated that these cost-effective, agar plate-based methods effectively distinguished algae strains exhibiting superior tolerance to extreme environmental conditions. These screening techniques not only provided clear differentiation among the closely related strains but also delivered reproducible outcomes suitable for scaling up to larger bioprospecting efforts. Furthermore, the affordability and simplicity of these methods facilitate their implementation in resource-limited laboratories, thereby broadening participation in algae bioprospecting endeavors. This study highlights the potential of low-cost, accessible screening techniques to significantly enhance the discovery and characterization of algal strains with extreme traits. Ultimately, these methods support the development of robust algae-based resources, driving innovation in diverse industrial processes and environmental solutions.

"Siderophores are microbial metabolites with a strong affinity for Fe(III) ions, in addition to other roles beyond iron acquisition. In this study, we propose that bacillibactin, a siderophore produced by the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, provides an advantage to its producer by inhibiting the specialized metabolism of antagonistic Penicillium fungi. Metabolome and transcriptome analyses indicate that iron deficiency caused by bacillibactin plays a critical role in downregulating the specialized metabolism of competing Penicillium species. Since many specialized metabolites of Penicillium spp. have antibacterial properties, we hypothesize that bacillibactin cross-protects other bacteria during fungal-bacterial community interactions. A tripartite coculture model demonstrated that bacillibactin production influences community dynamics by reducing the growth of specialized metabolite-producing Penicillium species, thereby facilitating the colonization of B. subtilis and other co-inhabiting bacterial species."
"Across evolutionary scales, lineages acquire and lose traits and associated genes. Most land plants form arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, an ancient trait for enhanced nutrition that was convergently lost in some clades. Carnivory, another nutritional trait, is a more recent adaptation that has convergently arisen in several angiosperm orders. The two biotic interactions similarly help plants acquire mineral nutrients, raising the question of whether they can coexist. However, the mycorrhizal status of carnivorous plants has long remained speculative. Here, we surveyed the occurrence of AM-associated genes in five angiosperm orders harbouring carnivorous species, revealing convergent losses of the AM trait either coincident with or predating the emergence of carnivory. Exceptionally, the carnivorous plant species Roridula gorgonias retains symbiosis-related genes and forms arbuscules upon inoculation assays, demonstrating the two nutritional strategies, although rare, can coexist. The youngest carnivorous lineage, Brocchinia reducta, showed signatures of the early stages of AM trait loss, as reflected by its gene retention and AM colonization patterns. An AM-associated CHITINASE gene encodes a digestive enzyme in the Australian pitcher plant Cephalotus, suggesting gene co-option. These findings illuminate the largely unexplored processes by which plant nutritional strategies evolve and supplant one another over time."
"Mannheimia haemolytica is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen associated with the economically costly bovine respiratory disease. Two genotypes have been described, of which genotype 2 is more strongly associated with disease. Several previous studies have investigated the genomic differences between the genotypes and/or the major serotypes (1, 2 and 6) of M. haemolytica, however we still lack a clear basis for the greater disease association of genotype 2 (serotypes 1 and 6) and demonstrations of phenotypic differences are scarce. This work builds upon previous investigations to identify genes that differentiate the two genotypes with a particular focus on genes that may play a role in virulence and fitness in the respiratory tract microbiome. We identified 422 genotype differentiating genes in a collection of 208 M. haemolytica genomes (62 genotype 1, 146 genotype 2). Genotype differentiating genes including genotype-associated variants of a TonB-dependent siderophore receptor homolog, transferrin binding protein B, leukotoxin A, and IgA1 proteases. We also identified a genotype 1 associated lytic transglycosylase, and a genotype 2 specific highly immunogenic outer membrane lipoprotein. These results expand our knowledge of what differentiates the genotypes of M. haemolytica and provides information that can be utilized to inform diagnostic strategies. The results also highlight the relative lack of information regarding M. haemolytica from sheep and goats and geographic regions other than Canada and the United States."
"Histone acetylation is a critical epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression by modulating chromatin structure and function. Histone acetyltransferases are essential for maintaining acetylation homeostasis and the disruption of this balance can lead to aberrant gene expression and cancer development. Here, we describe that the cancer-specific protein MAGE-A10 increases cellular histone acetylation by stabilizing essential histone acetyltransferases KAT2A and KAT2B. The aberrant expression of MAGE-A10 in tumors prevents the degradation of KAT2A/2B through p62-mediated autophagy. Mechanistically, MAGE-A10 antagonizes the binding of KAT2A/2B with the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CUL4A-DDB1, thereby decreasing the formation of their K63-linked ubiquitination. Furthermore, KAT2A enhances the transcription of the MAGE-A10 gene, forming a positive feedback loop that contributes to tumorigenesis. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms hijacked in cancer that drive perturbed histone acetylation and suggest potential therapeutic strategies."
"Activation of the cGAS-STING pathway stimulates innate immune signaling as well as LC3B lipidation and ubiquitylation at Golgi-related vesicles upon STING trafficking. Although ubiquitylation at these subcellular sites has been associated with regulating NF-{kappa}B-related innate immune signaling, the mechanisms of Golgi-localized polyubiquitin chain regulation of immune signaling is not well understood. We report here that the ubiquitin- and LC3B-binding proteins, TNIP1 and autophagy receptors p62, NBR1, NDP52, TAX1BP1, and OPTN associate with STING-induced ubiquitin and LC3B-labeled vesicles, and that p62 and NBR1 act redundantly in spatial clustering of the LC3B-labeled vesicles in the perinuclear region. We also find that while TBK1 kinase activity is not required for the recruitment of TNIP1 and the autophagy receptors, it also plays a role in sequestration of the LC3B-labeled vesicles. The ubiquitin binding domains, rather than the LC3B-interacting regions, of TNIP1 and OPTN are specifically important for their recruitment to Ub/LC3B-associated perinuclear vesicles, while OPTN is also recruited through a TBK1-dependent mechanism. Functionally, we find that TNIP1 and OPTN play a role in STING-mediated innate immune signaling, with TNIP1 acting as a significant negative regulator of both NF-{kappa}B- and Interferon-mediated gene expression. Together, these results highlight autophagy-independent mechanisms of autophagy receptors and TNIP1 with unanticipated roles in regulating STING-mediated innate immunity."
"Neuroscience can only be reproducible when its key methods are quantitative and interpretable. Calcium imaging is such a key method which, however, records neuronal activity only indirectly and is therefore difficult to interpret. These difficulties arise primarily from the kinetics, nonlinearity, and sensitivity of the calcium indicator, but also depend on the methods for calcium signal analysis. Here, we evaluate the ability of the recently developed calcium indicator GCaMP8 to reveal neuronal spiking, and we investigate how existing spike inference methods (CASCADE, OASIS, MLSpike) should be adapted for optimal performance. We demonstrate, both for principal cells and interneurons, that algorithms require fine-tuning to obtain optimal results with GCaMP8 data. Specifically, supervised algorithms adapted for GCaMP8 result in more linear and therefore more accurate recovery of complex spiking events. In addition, our analysis of cortical ground truth recordings shows that GCaMP8s and GCaMP8m - but not GCaMP6, GCaMP7f or GCaMP8f - are able to reliably detect isolated action potentials for realistic noise levels. Finally, we demonstrate that, due to their fast rise times, GCaMP8 indicators support shorter closed-loop latencies for real-time detection of neuronal activity. Together, our study provides demonstrations, tools, and guidelines to optimally process and quantitatively interpret calcium signals obtained with GCaMP8."
"Recent proteomic studies have found several different lysine modifications in plants related to various important metabolic pathways. Lysine deacylation is a key feature of sirtuins for the regulation of several cellular processes in mammals. This may be involved in the tolerance against different stress conditions in case of plants. In this study, we deliver a comprehensive structural and kinetic analysis describing the selection of lysine acidic acyl groups by OsCobB. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of OsCobB to erase glutaryl, succinyl, and malonyl groups from the designated lysine site is favored due to the presence of Tyr55 and Arg58 at the active site. The selectivity of the substrate is further based on the OsCobB active site residues as well as residues next to the modified lysine. These modifications can be further linked to the plants mechanism to cope with stress due to dehydration, cold temperature and different metal toxicities."
"Through symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, cultivated legumes provide themselves and subsequent crops with nitrogen, making genetic improvements of symbiotic efficiency particularly attractive. Here, we identify the symbiosis-specific GBP1 gene which negatively regulates nitrogen fixation by attenuating bacterial nitrogenase activity in Medicago truncatula nodules. GBP1 inactivation increases nitrogen fixation without affecting nodule development and numbers, providing inroads for engineering legumes with increased productivity for sustainable nitrogen provision."
"Experimental evolution studies that feature selection on life-history characters are a proven approach for studying the evolution of aging and variation in rates of senescence. Recently, the incorporation of genomic and transcriptomic approaches into this framework has led to the identification of hundreds of genes associated with different aging patterns. However, our understanding of the specific molecular mechanisms underlying these aging patterns remains limited. Here, we incorporated extensive metabolomic profiling into this framework to generate mechanistic insights into aging patterns in Drosophila melanogaster. Specifically, we characterized metabolomic change over adult lifespan in populations of D. melanogaster where selection for early reproduction has led to an accelerated aging phenotype relative to their controls. Using these data we: i) evaluated evolutionary repeatability across the metabolome; ii) assessed the value of the metabolome as a predictor of ""biological age"" in this system; and iii) identified specific metabolites associated with accelerated aging. Generally, our findings suggest that selection for early reproduction resulted in highly repeatable alterations to the metabolome and the metabolome itself is a reliable predictor of ""biological age"". Specifically, we find clusters of metabolites that are associated with the different rates of senescence observed between our accelerated aging population and their controls, adding new insights into the metabolites that may be driving the accelerated aging phenotype.

SignificanceWhile experimental evolution studies featuring Drosophila melanogaster have generated significant insights into the forces that shape aging and life history patterns, more recent efforts incorporating genomic and transcriptomic data have had comparatively little success identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying these patterns. Here we work to incorporate molecular phenotyping into this general framework as a way forward. Specifically, we characterize how the metabolome changes with age in populations of D. melanogaster where hundreds of generations of selection for early reproduction have led to enrichment for an accelerated aging phenotype. By comparing to control populations, we show that the metabolome does appear to capture true signals of ""biological age"" and provides a new avenue for understanding the factors that underlie complex trait variation in real populations."
"Normative reference charts are widely used in healthcare, especially for assessing the development of individuals by benchmarking anatomic and physiological features against population trajectories across the lifespan. Recent work has extended this concept to gray matter morphology in the brain, but no such reference framework currently exists for white matter (WM) even though WM constitutes the essential substrate for neuronal communication and large-scale network integration. Here, we present the first comprehensive WM brain charts, which describe how microstructural and macrostructural features of WM evolve across the lifespan, by leveraging over 26,199 diffusion MRI scans from 42 harmonized studies. Using generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS), we estimate age- and sex-stratified trajectories for 72 individual white matter pathways, quantifying both tract-specific microstructural and morphometric features. We demonstrate that these WM brain charts enable four important applications: (1) defining normative trajectories of WM maturation and decline across distinct pathways, (2) identifying previously uncharacterized developmental milestones and spatial gradients of tract maturation, (3) detecting individualized deviations from normative patterns with clinical relevance across multiple neurological disorders, and (4) facilitating standardized, cross-study centile scoring of new datasets. By establishing a unified, interpretable reference framework for WM structure, these brain charts provide a foundational metric for research and clinical neuroscience. The accompanying open-access trajectories, centile scoring tools, and harmonization methods facilitate precise mapping of WM development, aging, and pathology across diverse populations. We release the brain charts and provide an out-of-sample alignment process as a Docker image: https://zenodo.org/records/15367426."
"Blood gas disturbances caused by exposure to low oxygen (hypoxia) or high carbon dioxide levels (hypercapnia) lead to a compensatory increase in pulmonary ventilation. Among the motor changes supporting these reflex respiratory responses is the recruitment of abdominal muscles (ABD) during the expiratory phase, which can enhance expiratory airflow or alter the duration of the expiratory phase. In this study, we assessed the functional impact of ABD recruitment on metabolic, motor, and ventilatory parameters in unanesthetized, freely behaving animals. Sprague-Dawley Holtzman male adult rats (n=7) were instrumented to perform simultaneous recordings of pulmonary ventilation, body temperature, diaphragmatic and ABD activities, and O2 consumption during exposure to various levels of hypoxia (12-8% O2) and hypercapnia (3-7% CO2). We observed that hypoxia or hypercapnia conditions evoked AE; however, ABD recruitment did not occur during the entire exposure period, displaying an intermittent profile. The occurrence of AE during hypoxia and hypercapnia conditions was linked to additional increases in tidal volume when compared to periods without ABD activity (P<0.05) and showed no associations with changes in diaphragmatic burst amplitude. Analyses of flow-like patterns suggested that AE during hypoxia recruited expiratory reserve volume during late expiration, while under hypercapnia, it accelerated lung emptying and increased the expiratory flow peak during post-inspiration. We also observed that AE was associated with an increase in oxygen consumption and did not improve air convection requirement, suggesting that this motor behavior may influence other aspects of respiration that potentially improve alveolar ventilation and gas exchange.

Key points summaryO_LIAbdominal recruitment during the expiratory phase, known as active expiration (AE), emerges during blood gas disturbances to enhance pulmonary ventilation; however, the effect of AE on metabolic, motor, and ventilatory parameters in freely behaving animals exposed to hypoxia or hypercapnia remains uncertain.

"This study presents a checkerboard data analysis approach using a Hill function (y = 1/(1+(x/K)n) to fit each column and row of checkerboard assay data. Column fits give a K (MIC) value in units of row concentration for each column antibiotic concentration (MIC_row vs [Col]), and row fits give an MIC_col value for each row antibiotic (MIC_row vs [Row]). Since the corresponding row and column concentrations are themselves MICs, this provides two sets of MIC vs MIC data pairs which can be plotted together as an isobologram. These MIC_A vs MIC_B values can be subjected to a second round of Hill function fitting, separately in x-y and y-x directions. Finally, a fit based on overlapping Hill functions is developed that allows x-y and y-x dimension fits to be performed simultaneously. Formula for fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICIs) as a function of fit parameters, and other features of these curves, are derived. This analysis also provides ""n"" (steepness) values from column and row fits, which are themselves dependent on the other antibiotic concentration and can be exceptionally, as in the case of ceftobiprole alone (n>10). This synergistic checkerboard analysis approach is implemented in MATLAB, which performs the fits and provides statistics variable values and alternative models significance."
"In this study, we developed an integrated single cell transcriptomic (scRNAseq) atlas of human breast cancer (BC), the largest resource of its kind, totaling > 600,000 cells across 138 patients. Rigorous integration and annotation of publicly available scRNAseq data enabled a highly resolved characterization of epithelial, immune, and stromal heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Within the immune compartment we were able to characterize heterogeneity of CD4, CD8 T cells and macrophage subpopulations. Within the stromal compartment, subpopulations of endothelial cells (ECs) and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were resolved. Within the cancer epithelial compartment, we characterized the functional heterogeneity of cells across the axes of stemness, epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity, and canonical cancer pathways. Across all subpopulations observed in the TME, we performed a multi-resolution survival analysis to identify epithelial cell states and immune cell types which conferred a survival advantage in both The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and METABRIC. We also identified robust associations between TME composition and clinical phenotypes such as tumor subtype and grade that were not discernible when the analysis was limited to individual datasets, highlighting the need for atlas-based analyses. This atlas represents a valuable resource for further high-resolution analyses of TME heterogeneity within BC."
"Rapid in situ bioprinting on complex, human-scale anatomical surfaces remain a key challenge for clinical translation. Here, we present a gravity-independent, conformal bioprinting strategy using bi-phasic granular bioink and multinozzle printheads capable of adapting to arbitrary surface curvatures. The bioink comprised of jammed gelatin microgels suspended in a fibrinogen matrix exhibits yield-stress behavior to maintain shape fidelity after extrusion while supporting cell viability and proliferation. Two monolithic multinozzle printhead architectures with identical bioink delivery networks were evaluated: (1) a rigid configuration for handheld bioprinting and (2) a soft robotic variant capable of real-time curvature adaptation via pneumatic actuation. Microgravity experiments aboard a parabolic flight confirmed successful bioink deposition under [~]0 g conditions. A ladder-rung microfluidic architecture ensured uniform bioink delivery across printhead nozzles, improving deposition consistency. In situ bioprinting on anatomical facial phantoms confirmed conformal, high-throughput (deposition at 20 mm{middle dot}s-1) deposition of bioink over physiologically relevant curvatures, both with and without cells. Cell-laden constructs retained >85% cell viability post-printing and supported proliferation. This work introduces a scalable bioprinting platform suitable for clinical, remote, and deep-space environments, enabling autonomous tissue fabrication. The curvature-adaptive printhead advances current in situ bioprinting capabilities, facilitating the generation of personalized grafts with complex anatomical geometries."
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by mutation in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) accounts for 15-30% of familial ALS and is typically autosomal dominant. How single base pair/amino acid changes in this small protein cause neurodegeneration is unknown. In North America, SOD1A4V is the most common familial ALS SOD1 mutation and results in an aggressive form of ALS. Here, we present a novel genomically humanised mouse model of SOD1A4V, in which the mouse Sod1 locus has been replaced by the human SOD1 gene, with intact genomic architecture of exons and introns, but bearing an A4V mutation. In agreement with previously reported human genomic knock-in mice, the phenotype is mild; however, transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling reveal significant dysregulation of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and lipid metabolism. These changes suggest an early bioenergetic imbalance that precedes neuromuscular impairment. Our findings support metabolic dysfunction as an early event in ALS pathogenesis. This freely available SOD1A4V model provides a valuable tool for studying ALS progression and identifying therapeutic targets for pre-symptomatic treatment.

SUMMARY STATEMENTThis study describes the generation and analysis of novel genomically humanised SOD1A4V mice, revealing metabolic dysfunction through integrated multi-omic analyses, characterising a freely available potential pre-symptomatic ALS model for future research."
"Human tissues require a mechanism to generate durable, yet modifiable, transcriptional memories to sustain cell function across a lifetime. Previously, we demonstrated that nanoscale packing domains couple heterochromatin (cores) and euchromatin (outer zone) into unified reaction volumes that can generate transcriptional memory. In prior work, this framework demonstrated that RNA synthesis occurred within the ideal zone (intermediate density) portions of the domain. Naturally, this creates a question of where genes are positioned in relation to the packing domain architecture and which genetic material fills the domain core to sustain transcription. Here we propose that this could be solved by the encoded positioning of introns, intergenic segments, and exons as a projection of the functional packing layers of domains. This suggests that introns and intergenic segments are coupled to adjacent exons to generate coherent packing domain volumes. We illustrate how this organization would reconcile contradictions in epigenetic patterns, non-randomness in oncogenic mutations, and produce durable transcriptional memory. We conclude by showing that this genome geometry might have coincided with the rapid evolution of body-plan complexity, suggesting that chromatin geometry could be fundamental to metazoan evolution."
"The rapid emergence of mineralized structures in diverse animal groups during the late Ediacaran and early Cambrian periods likely resulted from modifications of pre-adapted biomineralization genes inherited from a common ancestor. As the oldest extant phylum with mineralized structures, sponges are key to understanding animal biomineralization. Yet, the biomineralization process in sponges, particularly in forming spicules, is not well-understood. To address this, we conducted transcriptomic, genomic, and proteomic analyses on the calcareous sponge Sycon ciliatum, supplemented by in situ hybridization. We identified 829 genes overexpressed in regions of increased calcite spicule formation, including 17 calcarins--proteins analogous to corals galaxins localized in the spicule matrix and expressed in sclerocytes. Their expression varied temporally and spatially, specific to certain spicule types, indicating that fine-tuned gene regulation is crucial for biomineralization control. Similar subtle expression changes are also relevant in stony coral biomineralization. Tandem gene arrangements and expression changes suggest that gene duplication and neofunctionalization have significantly shaped Sycon ciliatums biomineralization, similar to that in corals. These findings suggest a parallel evolution of carbonate biomineralization in the calcitic Sycon ciliatum and aragonitic corals, exemplifying the evolution of mechanisms crucial for animals to act as ecosystem engineers and form reef structures."
"3D printed laboratory tools are a fast-developing field, and microscopes in particular have seen several high-quality projects reported in recent years. However, currently available projects for 3D printed microscopes have not been optimised for molecular biology applications. We present an open-source, 3D-printable optical microscope that has been specifically designed for affordability, ease of use, and versatility in molecular biology applications, particularly for fluorescence detection, time lapse imaging, and higher throughput scanning of microtitre plates. The microscope integrates a large computer numerically controlled (CNC) stage, allowing precise scanning of wells in standard microtiter plates, and is equipped with a Raspberry Pi HQ camera module and customizable optical components, including standard microscope objectives. The modular design allows for a range of illumination setups, such as a 3 W blue LED for basic epifluorescence, and supports additional modifications, including dark field or RGB matrix lighting. The design opens new possibilities for cheap home-built microscopes for bioscience applications that are modular and easily adaptable for specific user needs."
"The 3 untranslated regions (3UTRs) of mRNAs play a critical role in controlling gene expression and function because they contain binding sites for microRNAs and RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that alter mRNA stability, localization, and translation. Most mRNA 3 ends contain multiple polyadenylation sites (PAS) that can be utilized in condition-specific manners, a process known as alternative polyadenylation (APA), however the mechanisms driving the regulation of APA remain poorly characterized. By integrating a large set of over 500 RNA binding protein (RBP) depletion and binding experiments across two cell lines generated by the ENCODE consortium, we uncovered a number of RBPs in each cell type whose depletion leads to widespread alteration of 3 UTR patterns. These include not only known regulators of APA, but also many putative novel regulators of 3UTR isoform expression. We focused analysis on the largely unstudied DEAD box RNA helicase, DDX55, and validate its novel role in 3UTR isoform regulation using molecular assays and targeted 3 end sequencing experiments. Our findings identify DDX55 as a new regulator of APA, particularly at PAS that contain features of RNA secondary structure. Our data also suggest additional previously unrecognized regulators of 3 UTR processing and differential stability."
"Learning and memory are thought to require hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity that is persistently impaired after cerebral ischemia and that requires movement of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to excitatory synapses. We show here that oxygen/glucose-deprivation (OGD) in cultures hippocampal neurons causes a long-lasting impairment of CaMKII movement. Notably, CaMKII inhibition at 30 min after onset of OGD prevented the impairment in CaMKII movement. Thus, CaMKII mediates both, LTP mechanisms and their ischemia-induced impairment. These findings provide a mechanism by which ischemic conditions can impair LTP and explain how CaMKII inhibition after cerebral ischemia can prevent these LTP impairments."
"Dimethyl sulfate (DMS) chemical mapping probes RNA structure, where low reactivity is generally interpreted as Watson-Crick (WC) base pairs and high reactivity as unpaired nucleotides. Studies examining DMS reactivity of RNAs with known 3D structures have identified nucleotides that deviate from this interpretation with distinct solvent accessibility and hydrogen bonding patterns. Understanding the frequency of these outliers and their recurring structural 3D features remains incomplete. To address this knowledge gap, we systematically analyzed DMS reactivity patterns across a library of 7,500 RNA constructs containing two-way junctions with known 3D structures. We observe DMS reactivity exists on a continuum over four orders of magnitude with approximately 10% overlap in reactivity between WC and non-WC nucleotides. We find that non-WC bases with WC-like DMS protection exhibit increased hydrogen bonding and decreased solvent accessibility, whereas WC pairs exhibiting greater DMS reactivity tend to flank junctions, correlating with weaker base stacking and greater junction dynamics. Furthermore, we discover that DMS reactivity values in non-canonical pairs correlate with atomic distances and base pair geometry, enabling discrimination between different 3D conformations. These DMS reactivity patterns indicate that DMS reactivity provides atomic-scale information about RNA 3D conformations, which can be used to model RNA structures and dynamics."
"N6,2-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) is a modified nucleotide located at the first transcribed position in mRNA and snRNA that is essential for diverse physiological processes. m6Am mapping methods assume each gene uses a single start nucleotide. However, gene transcription usually involves multiple start sites, generating numerous 5 isoforms. Thus, gene levels annotations cannot capture the diversity of m6Am modification in the transcriptome. Here we describe CROWN-seq, which simultaneously identifies transcription-start nucleotides and quantifies m6Am stoichiometry for each 5 isoform that initiates with adenosine. Using CROWN-seq, we map the m6Am landscape in nine human cell lines. Our findings reveal that m6Am is nearly always a high stoichiometry modification, with only a small subset of cellular mRNAs showing lower m6Am stoichiometry. We find that m6Am is associated with increased transcript expression and provide evidence that m6Am may be linked to transcription initiation associated with specific promoter sequences and initiation mechanisms. These data suggest a potential new function for m6Am in influencing transcription."
"Plant early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) are chlorophyll-binding thylakoid membrane proteins commonly believed to function in photoprotection. However, results of studies with mutants or transgenic plants have been contradictory regarding this function, and the mechanistic workings of ELIPs have mostly remained elusive. We studied: (1) ELIP function in tomato (Solanum lycoperiscum) by generation and photosynthetic/physiological characterization of slelip mutants under various light conditions; and (2) ELIP tissue/cell localization by monitoring expression of the Venus yellow fluorescent protein fused to the native SlELIP1 promoter ( pSlELIP1::Venus) in transgenic tomato. Notably, slelip mutants did not display compromised photosynthetic performance and were not more sensitive to photoinhibition compared to parental plants, even following direct sunlight exposure. Surprisingly, pSlELIP1::Venus fusions revealed preferential expression in the leaf epidermis and specifically in stomatal guard cells, with no apparent expression in the mesophyll. No major alterations were observed in leaf gas exchange in slelip mutants at different light conditions. Intriguingly, stomatal conductance was reduced in slelip mutants upon the transition from dark to light. We propose an alternative hypothesis for plant ELIPs as players in the response of guard cells to light, connecting chlorophyll to stomatal function, and presenting a novel research direction for these enigmatic proteins."
"This article basically explores the impact of univariate & multivariate filter-based feature selection methodologies on enhancing the classification performance for the real-life classification problems. Our study considers two univariate filter-based feature selection techniques, namely, Chi-square and Fisher score, as well as two multivariate filter-based feature selection techniques, viz., Symmetrical Uncertainty and Minimum Redundancy-Maximum Relevance (mRMR). These methods are applied to feature selection from Five diverse collections of datasets, including datasets related to Mixed-lineage Leukaemia (MLL), Lung Cancer, Ovarian Cancer, Central Nervous System (CNS), and Colon Cancer. For each feature, fitness values are calculated using the four aforementioned feature selection methods. After that, a stratified 10-fold cross-validation procedure is conducted using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) to determine the classification accuracy for each feature. A set of five microarray datasets was used in this evaluation in order to assess the effectiveness of the filter methods. The results of this study represent the first comprehensive analysis and comparison of gene expression datasets filtered using a variety of ranking strategies. Among these approaches, entropy-based methods (e.g., mRMR) emerge as the most effective. The mRMR method demonstrates Outstanding performance outcomes of accuracy, F1-score, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). When comparing classifier performance, the F1-score, which combines precision and recall, is particularly useful, while the RMSE measures prediction accuracy. Chi-square, Fisher Score, and Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU) follow as the second, third, and fourth best approaches, respectively. Although the SVM classifier demonstrates superior performance, the difference in accuracy between SVM and the MLP classifier is marginal.

"The spatial organization of adaptive immune cells within lymph nodes is critical for understanding immune responses during infection and disease. Here, we introduce AIR-SPACE, an integrative approach that combines high-resolution spatial transcriptomics with paired, high-fidelity long-read sequencing of T and B cell receptors. This method enables the simultaneous analysis of cellular transcriptomes and adaptive immune receptor (AIR) repertoires within their native spatial context. We applied AIR-SPACE to mouse popliteal lymph nodes at five distinct time points after Vaccinia virus footpad infection and constructed a comprehensive map of the developing adaptive immune response. Our analysis revealed heterogeneous activation niches, characterized by Interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) production, during the early stages of infection. At later stages, we delineated sub-anatomical structures within the germinal center (GC) and observed evidence that antibody-producing plasma cells differentiate and exit the GC through the dark zone. Furthermore, by combining clonotype data with spatial lineage tracing, we demonstrate that B cell clones are shared among multiple GCs within the same lymph node, reinforcing the concept of a dynamic, interconnected network of GCs. Overall, our study demonstrates how AIR-SPACE can be used to gain insight into the spatial dynamics of infection responses within lymphoid organs."
"Competition among plants can lead to allocation strategies that favor individual competitiveness at the expense of group-level productivity. However, the role of root and shoot responses in driving these outcomes is intensely debated. Experimental approaches often have difficulty disentangling above- and belowground interactions due to the confounding effects of pot size and nutrient distribution. Here, we used physical dividers and varied inter-plant distances (3-24 cm) in soybean to isolate competitive interactions while controlling for these confounding effects. Simultaneous above- and belowground competition increased relative root allocation, but reduced total biomass. Aboveground competition alone had stronger effects, triggering shade avoidance and reducing both shoot and root biomass. This likely overrode belowground cues. These results underscore the significance of neighbor-induced responses, particularly under full competition, as pivotal drivers of allocation patterns and promising targets for breeding strategies that enhance collective crop performance."
"Each of us perceives the world differently. What may underlie such individual differences in perception? Here, we characterize the lateral prefrontal cortexs role in vision using computational models, with a specific focus on individual differences. Using a 7T fMRI dataset, we found that encoding models relating visual features extracted from a deep neural network to brain responses to natural images robustly predict responses in patches of LPFC. We then explored the representational structures and screened for images with high predicted responses in LPFC. We observed more substantial individual differences in the coding schemes of LPFC compared to visual regions. Computational modeling suggests that the amplified individual differences could result from the random projection between sensory and high-level regions underlying flexible working memory. Our study demonstrates the under-appreciated role of LPFC in visual processing and suggests that LPFC may underlie the idiosyncrasies in how different individuals experience the visual world."
"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) surveillance in regions with mass gatherings presents unique challenges for public health systems. Saudi Arabia, hosting millions of pilgrims annually, provides a distinctive setting for studying how human mobility shapes bacterial populations, yet comprehensive genomic surveillance data from this region remains limited. Here, we present an integrated analysis of S. aureus isolates collected across seven Saudi Arabian regions, combining whole-genome sequencing with extensive antimicrobial susceptibility testing and standardized metadata following FAIR data principles. Our analysis revealed striking differences between pilgrimage and non-pilgrimage cities. Pilgrimage cities showed significantly higher genetic diversity and antimicrobial resistance rates, harboring numerous international strains including recognized clones from diverse geographic origins. Reported lineage dynamics is changing, expanding toward community clones. While genomic prediction of antimicrobial resistance showed high accuracy for some antibiotics, particularly beta-lactams, with varying performance for others, highlighting the necessity for phenotypic testing in clinical settings. Our findings demonstrate how mass gatherings drive bacterial population structures and emphasize the importance of integrated surveillance approaches in regions with significant global connectivity and travel.

ImportanceGenomic data enables the tracking of pathogens by revealing clonal expansions within populations and identifying successful lineages. However, comprehensive national-level data from Saudi Arabia remains limited on a large scale. The adoption of FAIR principles and reproducible workflows ensures robust, consistent analysis, fostering effective data sharing. The OneHealth approachs success depends on the integration and collaboration across diverse domains in todays digital landscape."
"The integration of multimodal MRI images, including functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI), depicts a key advancement in neuroimaging, since it offers a more comprehensive and better understanding of brain function and connections. FMRI captures brain functional activity while dMRI reveals structural connectivity via white matter bundles, each of which provide unique yet complementary insights; however combing these two modalities, particularly at a dynamic level, is challenging due to their drastically different data characteristics. This study introduces a novel framework named ""dynamic fusion,"" which extends joint component analysis (cmICA) to integrate static structural connectivity (SC) with dynamic functional connectivity (FC). Our approach gauges the relationship between these joint components across various temporal states, aiming to discover both static and dynamic features of brain connectivity. We applied this approach to fMRI and dMRI data from the same set of control subjects, which we had previously studied to estimate joint parcellation and their structural and functional connections using a static model only, and also included a comparable number of individuals with schizophrenia from the same study. Our results reveal that dynamic fusion not only highlights diverse temporal dynamics in FC but, more importantly, also shows how SC patterns differ across dynamic functional states at different time frames, providing new insights into brain organization. Furthermore, it successfully detects joint structural-functional connectivity differences between individuals with schizophrenia and controls, demonstrating its potential for detecting hidden group differences. Overall, this study establishes our dynamic fusion as a powerful tool for integrating structural and dynamic functional connectivity data, enhancing our understanding of brain connectivity and offering new perspectives for studying neurological disorders."
"-synuclein (SNCA) is the greatest genetic risk factor for sporadic Parkinsons Disease (PD). Misfolding and overexpression of SNCA underlie pathognomonic features of PD, including SNCA aggregates and midbrain dopaminergic (mbDA) neurodegeneration. We recently identified an SNCA intronic sequence that harbors variation associated with PD risk and demonstrated its role as a neuronal cis-regulatory element (CRE). Here, we engineered a mouse model lacking this sequence, which exhibits significantly reduced Snca transcription in mbDA neurons. Employing a battery of motor, molecular, and histological assays in an established mouse model of PD, we demonstrate that mice lacking this Snca enhancer are protected against PD-relevant histopathology and motor impairments. By targeting a cell-dependent CRE to diminish PD onset/progression in mice, we introduce a potentially powerful therapeutic avenue for PD."
"The mechanisms of central tolerance, which rely on the presentation of self-antigens by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) and DCs, prevent autoimmunity by eliminating self-reactive T-cells. While mTECs produce self-antigens in an autonomous manner, DCs acquire them from mTECs via cooperative antigen transfer (CAT). Our recent data showed that preferential pairing occurs between distinct subsets of mTECs and DCs in CAT, providing a rationale for the existence of molecular determinants which control such pairing and the outcome of central tolerance. Here, we compared the transcriptomes of CAT-experienced and -inexperienced DCs and identified Claudin 1 as a molecule involved in CAT-coupled type 1 DC (DC1) maturation. By mapping thymic DC1 heterogeneity, we identified their early and late maturation states. DC1-specific ablation of Claudin 1 led to a reduction in CAT-experienced late mature DC1s and hampered DC1 maturation. These phenotypes correlated with the displacement of DC1s from the vicinity of mTECs. This translated into impaired Treg selection and clonal deletion of TRA-specific T-cells manifested via a break in tolerance and symptoms of multi-organ autoimmunity. Collectively, our results identify thymic DC1-derived Claudin 1 as a regulator of immune tolerance.

One Sentence SummaryThe expression of Claudin 1 on type 1 dendritic cells regulates their proximity to mTECs, which is required for effective antigen transfer coupled with DC1 maturation and establishment of T-cell tolerance."
"For many inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) the understanding of disease mechanisms remains limited in part explaining their unmet medical needs. We hypothesize that the expressivity of IEM disease phenotypes is affected by the activity of specific modifier pathways, which is controlled by rare and common polygenic variation. To identify these modulating pathways, we used RNA sequencing to generate molecular signatures of IEM in disease relevant tissues. We then integrated these disease signatures with multiomic data and gene regulatory networks generated from animal and human populations without overt IEM. We identified and subsequently validated glucocorticoid signaling as a candidate modifier of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorders, and we re-capitulated complement signaling as a modifier of inflammation in Gaucher disease. Our work describes a novel approach that can overcome the rare disease-rare data dilemma, and reveal new IEM pathophysiology and potential drug targets using multiomics data in seemingly healthy populations.

Take-home message: Multiomic data and gene regulatory networks derived from animal and human populations without overt IEM can be used to study disease mechanisms in inborn errors of metabolism."
"Asymptomatic persistence is crucial for the survival of malaria parasites in seasonal transmission settings, where transmission halts during dry months, while mosquitos are scarce and new infections rare. How Plasmodium falciparum avoids causing host symptoms or being cleared is not fully understood. Parasites that persist through the dry season circulate longer within the [~]48h replication cycle compared to parasites isolated from clinical cases, where only early stages circulate. The mechanisms promoting increased circulation and avirulent infections bridging two wet seasons remain unclear. We generated a single-cell RNA-seq reference atlas with P. falciparum erythrocytic stages of a recently adapted isolate, and with it defined the developmental stage of over 25000 parasites from six asymptomatic children at the dry-wet season transition, and nine children with clinical malaria in the wet season. Our data confirms that older parasites circulate in the dry season, and reveals transcriptional modulation of exported proteins that affect cytoadhesion of infected erythrocytes, which we validated by immuno-fluorescence microscopy."
"The Gram-negative anaerobe Fusobacterium nucleatum is an oral oncobacterium that promotes colorectal cancer (CRC) development with the amyloid-forming cell surface adhesin FadA integral to CRC tumorigenesis. We describe here molecular genetic studies uncovering a novel mode of metabolic regulation of FadA-mediated tumor formation by a highly conserved respiratory enzyme known as the Rnf complex. First, we show that genetic disruption of Rnf, via rnfC deletion, significantly reduces the level of fadA transcript, accompanied by a near-complete abolishment of the precursor form of FadA (pFadA), reduced assembly of FadA at the mature cell pole, and severe defects in the osmotic stress-induced formation of FadA amyloids. We show further that the Rnf complex regulates three response regulators (CarR, ArlR, and S1), which modulate the expression of pFadA, without affecting fadA transcript. Consistent with our hypothesis that these response regulators control factors that process FadA, deletion of rnfC, carR, arlR, or s1 each impairs expression of the signal peptidase gene lepB, and FadA production is nearly abolished by CRISPR-induced depletion of lepB. Importantly, while rnfC deletion does not affect the ability of the mutant cells to adhere to CRC cells, rnfC deficiency significantly diminishes the fusobacterial invasion of CRC cells and formation of spheroid tumors in vitro. Evidently, the Rnf complex modulates the expression of the FadA adhesin and tumorigenesis through a gene regulatory network consisting of multiple response regulators, each controlling a signal peptidase that is critical for the post-translational processing of FadA and surface assembly of FadA amyloids.

IMPORTANCEThe Rhodobacter nitrogen-fixation (Rnf) complex of Fusobacterium nucleatum plays an important role in the pathophysiology of this oral pathobiont, since genetic disruption of this conserved respiratory enzyme negatively impacts a wide range of metabolic pathways, as well as bacterial virulence in mice. Nonetheless, how Rnf deficiency weakens the virulence potential of F. nucleatum is not well understood. Here, we show that genetic disruption of the Rnf complex reduces surface assembly of adhesin FadA and FadA-mediated amyloid formation, via regulation of signal peptidase LepB by multiple response regulators. As FadA is critical in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC), the ability to invade CRC cells and promote spheroid tumor growth is strongly diminished in an Rnf-deficient mutant. Thus, this work uncovers a molecular linkage between the Rnf complex and LepB-regulated processing of FadA - likely via metabolic signaling - that maintains the virulence potential of this oncobacterium in various cellular niches."
"Neural entrainment to certain acoustic features can predict speech-in-noise perception, but these features are difficult to separate. We measured neural responses to both natural speech-in-noise and stimuli (auditory figure-ground) that simulate speech-in-noise without any acoustic or linguistic confound such as stress contour and semantics. The figure-ground stimulus is formed by multiple temporally coherent pure-tone components embedded in a random tone cloud. Previous work has shown that discrimination of dynamic figure-ground based on the fundamental frequency (F0) of natural speech predicts speech-in-noise recognition independent of hearing and age. In this study, we compared the brain substrate for the figure-ground analysis based on the F0 contour and a statistically similar  1/f contour with speech-in-noise. We used the temporal response function to predict the electroencephalography responses to the frequency trajectories of the auditory targets. We demonstrate that the brain significantly tracked the pitch changes in both AFG conditions (F0 and 1/F tracking) and a sentence-in-noise condition (F0 tracking) at similar latencies, but at similar magnitudes only when tracking the F0 contour. The pitch-tracking accuracy was consistently high across the delta and theta bands for the AFG condition but not for speech. Sensor-space analysis revealed that speech-in-noise performance correlated with the positive peak amplitude of the F0 figure-ground at 100 ms. Source-space analysis revealed bilateral temporal lobe and hippocampal generators, and strong tracking in the superior parietal lobe for auditory figures and natural speech. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the human brain reliably tracks the F0 trajectory of both speech and a non-linguistic figure in noise, with speech tracking showing reduced accuracy in the theta band compared to figure-ground tracking. Despite the difference in prediction accuracy, we reveal striking similarities in neural entrainment patterns and source locations between the two paradigms. These results suggest that neural entrainment engages high-level cortical mechanisms independent of linguistic content. Furthermore, we show that TRF peak amplitude serves as a potential biomarker for speech-in-noise ability, highlighting possible clinical applications."
"The gastric mucosa is characterized by continuous innate immune surveillance and inflammatory signaling, yet a high proportion of gastric carcinomas (GCs) are recalcitrant to immune-directed therapies. The mechanisms by which GCs evade adaptive immune surveillance within the highly antigenic microenvironment of the gastric mucosa remains unknown. To address this, we collected patient-matched tumor tissue, distant normal tissue, metastasis, and draining lymph nodes to generate a large-scale single-cell immune profiling dataset from 64 patients (n=179 samples, >150,000 cells). From single cell analysis, we identified two distinct sources of impaired tumor surveillance within tumor draining lymph nodes. First, we observed that a significant fraction of tumor draining lymph nodes had undergone cytokine-driven reprogramming, leading to reduced dendritic cell homing and limited T cell priming. Second, T cells undergoing successful activation exhibited limited expansion and constrained differentiation, marked by expression of the quiescence-associated transcription factor Kruppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2). Overexpression of KLF2 in primary T cells limited both their differentiation and cytotoxic capacity. These findings implicate both impaired T cell priming and KLF2-dependent T cell quiescence in limiting T cell immunity in gastric adenocarcinoma. We suggest these findings represent an emerging model for immune silencing in tumors developing from tissues with chronic inflammation."
"Descending neurons (DNs) occupy a key position in the sensorimotor hierarchy, conveying signals from the brain to the rest of the body below the neck. In Drosophila melanogaster flies, approximately 480 DN cell types have been described from electron-microscopy image datasets. Genetic access to these cell types is crucial for further investigation of their role in generating behaviour. We previously conducted the first large-scale survey of Drosophila melanogaster DNs, describing 98 unique cell types from light microscopy and generating cell-type-specific split-Gal4 driver lines for 65 of them. Here, we extend our previous work, describing the morphology of 146 additional DN types from light microscopy, bringing the total number DN types identified in light microscopy datasets to 244, or roughly 50% of all DN types. In addition, we produced 500 new sparse split-Gal4 driver lines and compiled a list of previously published DN lines from the literature for a combined list of 806 split-Gal4 driver lines targeting 190 DN types."
"Protein complexes are critical for cellular functions, and subunit exchange within these complexes is increasingly recognized as a key regulatory mechanism. In the cyanobacterial circadian clock, subunits shuffling of the core clock protein KaiC is thought to synchronize the clock, though the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We developed a chromatography-based method to monitor the shuffling dynamics of hexamerization domain of KaiC (KaiC-CI) and found that ATPase activity is essential for this process. By analyzing experiment data with quantitative models, we found that KaiC-CI hexamer stochastically disassembles into two oligomers for shuffling after hydrolysis. Further, by assuming a hidden conformation for post-hydrolysis hexamers, we established an ATPase activity-dependent model that quantitatively describes the shuffling dynamics of KaiC-CI hexamers, linking the shuffling rate to ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange rates. Using this model, we estimated the shuffling dynamics of full-length KaiC with indirect experimental data. Our findings suggest that KaiCs phosphorylation states regulate nucleotide exchange rates in the CI domain, thereby modulating ATPase activity and influencing subunit shuffling. This study provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the role of ATPase activity in subunit exchange and its implications for circadian clock regulation."
"Siderophores are microbial metabolites with a strong affinity for Fe(III) ions, in addition to other roles beyond iron acquisition. In this study, we propose that bacillibactin, a siderophore produced by the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, provides an advantage to its producer by inhibiting the specialized metabolism of antagonistic Penicillium fungi. Metabolome and transcriptome analyses indicate that iron deficiency caused by bacillibactin plays a critical role in downregulating the specialized metabolism of competing Penicillium species. Since many specialized metabolites of Penicillium spp. have antibacterial properties, we hypothesize that bacillibactin cross-protects other bacteria during fungal-bacterial community interactions. A tripartite coculture model demonstrated that bacillibactin production influences community dynamics by reducing the growth of specialized metabolite-producing Penicillium species, thereby facilitating the colonization of B. subtilis and other co-inhabiting bacterial species."
"Deciphering cis-regulatory logic underlying cell type identity is a fundamental question in biology. Single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) data has enabled training of sequence-to-function deep learning models allowing decoding of enhancer logic and design of synthetic enhancers. Training such models requires large amounts of high-quality training data across species, organs, development, aging, and disease. To facilitate the cost-effective generation of large scATAC-seq atlases for model training, we developed a new version of the open-source microfluidic system HyDrop with increased sensitivity and scale: HyDrop v2. We generated HyDrop v2 atlases for the mouse cortex and Drosophila embryo development and compared them to atlases generated on commercial platforms. HyDrop v2 data integrates seamlessly with commercially available chromatin accessibility methods (10x Genomics). Differentially accessible regions and motif enrichment across cell types are equivalent between HyDrop-v2 and 10x atlases. Sequence-to-function models trained on either atlas are comparable as well in terms of enhancer predictions, sequence explainability, and transcription factor footprinting. By offering accessible data generation, enhancer models trained on HyDrop-v2 and mixed atlases can contribute to unraveling cell-type specific regulatory elements in health and disease."
"The rapid expansion of readily accessible compounds over the past six years has transformed molecular docking, improving hit rates and affinities. While many millions of molecules may score well in a docking campaign, the results are rarely fully shared, hindering the benchmarking of machine learning and chemical space exploration methods that seek to explore the expanding chemical spaces. To address this gap, we develop a website providing access to recent large library campaigns, including poses, scores, and in vitro results for campaigns against 11 targets, with 6.3 billion molecules docked and 3729 compounds experimentally tested. In a simple proof-of-concept study that speaks to the new librarys utility, we use the new database to train machine learning models to predict docking scores and to find the top 0.01% scoring molecules while evaluating only 1% of the library. Even in these proof-of-concept studies, some interesting trends emerge: unsurprisingly, as models train on larger sets, they perform better; less expected, models could achieve high correlations with docking scores and yet still fail to enrich the new docking-discovered ligands, or even the top 0.01% of docking-ranked molecules. It will be interesting to see how these trends develop for methods more sophisticated than the simple proof-of-concept studies undertaken here; the database is openly available at lsd.docking.org."
"Numerous studies highlight alterations in motor cortical neurophysiology after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In contrast, understanding of effects in cognitive brain areas, which potentially underpin more impactful effects of injury, remains limited. The current study addressed this limitation by using electroencephalography to index responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS-EEG) applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In 18 mTBI patients and 22 healthy controls, TMS-EEG was used to index cortical inhibition and long-term depression (LTD)-like plasticity within DLPFC. These were assessed using paired-pulse TMS (short-[SICI] and long-[LICI] interval intracortical inhibition) and continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), respectively. Functional effects of injury were assessed via the N-back and Trail Making Test. Responses were quantified in both temporal (i.e., TMS-evoked potentials; TEPs) and spectral (i.e., TMS-related oscillations; TROs) domains. For TEPs, measures of inhibition and plasticity both tended to be reduced by mTBI. In contrast, TRO data suggested a contradictory increased response of patients to both paired-pulse stimulation and cTBS that was specific to high-frequency bands. In addition, while TMT performance was reduced in the mTBI group, this was unrelated to neurophysiological effects of injury. These findings highlight novel effects of mTBI on DLPFC neurophysiology and emphasise the importance of considering both evoked and induced activity when examining neurophysiological effects of mTBI."
"We have developed RepTiles, a system for generating traces of random DNA for synthetic genomics applications. RepTiles reduced the burden associated with the manual design of long DNA from standard biological parts. We are applying RepTiles to the construction of random DNA segments that will form part of a neochromosome in Physcomitrium patens. RepTiles has a base DNA collection of 52 1.7 kb chemically synthesised Phytobricks mini-chunks. We provide a user-friendly web application that facilitates the design of DNA assemblies based on the base collection. The system generates assembly plans for generating chunks using Golden Braid. The resulting chunks can then be assembled into megachunks using Transformation Associated Recombination cloning. It thus supports the generation of ultra-long synthetic DNA from phytobricks, contributing to the vision of synthetic plant genomics from modular parts to complete genomes."
"Trajectory inference (TI) has emerged as a crucial approach for understanding cellular development and differentiation processes. By reconstructing the temporal ordering of individual cells, TI can analyze the mechanisms underlying development and disease progression. Various TI methods have been proposed and applied across diverse fields, including cancer research and immunology. However, most existing methods rely solely on gene expression data and do not incorporate other omics information such as DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and protein expression. To address this limitation, approaches that integrate multiple omics datasets for TI have been proposed. Nevertheless, these methods typically assume the use of only common variables across datasets, making it difficult to align heterogeneous data with differing measurement targets across omics layers. This limitation can lead to information loss and challenges in capturing interactions between different omics datasets, which may reduce integration accuracy. In this study, we propose a novel TI method that captures interactions among variables across different omics layers and accommodates unpaired datasets with non-overlapping measurement targets. By effectively capturing relationships between different omics layers, our approach enables a more comprehensive multi-omics TI framework, thus providing deeper insights into cellular development."
"Characterizing cell activities within a spatially resolved context is essential to enhance our understanding of spatially-induced cellular states and features. While single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) offers comprehensive profiling of cells within a tissue, it fails to capture spatial context. Conversely, subcellular spatial transcriptomics (SST) technologies provide high-resolution spatial profiles of gene expression, yet their utility is constrained by the limited number of genes they can simultaneously profile. To address this limitation, we introduce VISTA, a novel approach designed to predict the expression levels of unobserved genes specifically tailored for SST data. VISTA jointly models scRNA-seq data and SST data based on variational inference and geometric deep learning, and incorporates uncertainty quantification. Using four SST datasets, we demonstrate VISTAs superior performance in imputation and in analyzing large-scale SST datasets with satisfactory time efficiency and memory consumption. The imputation of VISTA enables a multitude of downstream applications, including the detection of new spatially variable genes, the discovery of novel ligand-receptor interactions, the inference of spatial RNA velocity, the generation for spatial transcriptomics with in-silico perturbation, and an improved decomposition of spatial and intrinsic variations."
"Lexical processing is a core cognitive function involving the integration of semantic and symbolic information across distributed brain networks. In this study, we investigate the spatial dynamics and functional connectivity underlying lexical categorization using electroencephalography (EEG) data from a silent reading task. Participants were presented with words from two categories--social and numeric--while EEG signals were recorded and analyzed. Frequency band power and inter-electrode coherence were extracted as features to train Random Forest classifiers for word category prediction. The spatial dynamics model, based on band power from selected electrodes, achieved 100% classification accuracy and identified region- and frequency-specific contributions, notably in the theta and alpha bands across parietal and occipital regions. A complementary functional connectivity model achieved 85% accuracy, highlighting the role of inter-regional coherence in lexical differentiation. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining traditional EEG analysis with machine learning for decoding semantic categories, providing foundational insights for future brain-computer interface applications."
"Voltage-dependence gating of ion channels underlies numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes, and disruption of normal voltage gating is the cause of many channelopathies. Here, long timescale atomistic simulations were performed to directly probe voltage-induced gating transitions of the big potassium (BK) channels, where the voltage sensor domain (VSD) movement has been suggested to be distinct from that of canonical Kv channels but remains poorly understood. Using a Core-MT construct without the gating ring, multiple voltage activation transitions were observed at 750 mV, allowing detailed analysis of the activated state of BK VSD and key mechanistic features. Even though the S4 helix remains the principal voltage sensor in BK, its vertical displacement is only [~]3 [A] and accompanied by significant lateral movements. The nature of the predicted VSD movement is in strong agreement with recent Cryo-EM structural studies of mutant BK channels with constitutively activated VSD. Free energy analysis based on the predicted activation transition yielded a total gating charge of 0.44 e per VSD, consistent with the experimental range of 0.48 - 0.65 e. We further show that the ability of modest physical movements with a small total gating charge to drive effective voltage gating of BK can be attributed to large gradients in the local electric field as reshaped by the protein. Furthermore, the S4 movement is coupled to the pore opening through a non-canonical pathway that involves the tightly packed S4-S5-S6 interface. These distinct mechanistic features may be relevant to voltage gating of other ion channels where VSDs are not domain-swapped with respect to the pore-gate domain.

Significance StatementThe big potassium (BK) channel is the only potassium channel that integrates intracellular calcium signaling with membrane depolarization. It is considered one of the most important channels in cardiovascular and neurological disorders. It has been known that voltage gating of BK channels has distinct features compared to the canonical voltage gating mechanism established through studies of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. Yet, little is known about the molecular nature of voltage sensing and pore activation of BK channels at present. Our work reports the first successful direct simulation of voltage-dependent activation of the big potassium (BK) channel, revealing novel voltage sensing and sensor-pore coupling mechanisms that have largely eluded the community until now."
"{beta}-lactamases play an important role in antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. Understanding the spread of these enzymes may inform the development of better drug therapies. However, this is complicated by the fact that {beta}-lactamases reduce the antibiotic concentration in their environment, thereby altering their own selective advantage via eco-evolutionary feedback. We investigated the effect of such feedback on the spread of bacterial strains expressing {beta}-lactamase enzymes conferring different levels of resistance to the cephalosporin cefotaxime. Specifically, we conducted head-to-head competitions between two clinically observed {beta}-lactamase mutants, TEM-19 and TEM-52, with low and high activity against cefotaxime, respectively. By experimentally varying nutrient levels, we altered cell density and hence the strength of ecological feedback and examined its impact on competitive fitness and strain coexistence across a range of cefotaxime concentrations. A population dynamic model, parameterized solely with independently measured traits, revealed cell density as the key mediator of this feedback. Our results show that cell density dictates whether the resistant strain (TEM-52) outcompetes or stably coexists with the susceptible strain (TEM-19). By validating our model with experimental data, we showed that it can reasonably predict the equilibrium frequencies based on dose-dependent growth rates and antibiotic degradation rates of both strains. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering ecological feedback for understanding the fate of antibiotic-degrading mutants, including in clinical environments.

ImportanceSince the discovery of penicillin, {beta}-lactam antibiotics have become the most widely used antibiotics to treat bacterial infections. Their applicability is decreasing because bacteria evolve resistance via expression of antibiotic-degrading {beta}-lactamase enzymes. Because the spread of resistance is a large health problem, th prediction of resistance evolution is a big target. Several mutations increasing resistance have been studied, but as enzymes with increased activity spread, cells deactivate the {beta}-lactam antibiotics and thereby open a niche for susceptible variants. This eco-evolutionary feedback complicates the prediction of resistance evolution and makes it context dependent. Here, we show that both the cell density and the antibiotic concentration affect the success of a new {beta}-lactamase variant and whether it can invade, replace, or coexist with an ancestor variant. With a mathematical model we can predict the success of new variants and therefore predict evolutionary paths depending on the environmental variables."
"Humans effortlessly relate what they see to what they know, drawing on existing knowledge of objects perceptual, conceptual, and contextual attributes while searching for and recognising objects. While prior studies have investigated the temporal dynamics of perceptual and conceptual object properties in the neural signal, it remains unclear whether and when contextual associations are uniquely represented. In this study, we used representational similarity analysis on electroencephalography (EEG) data to explore how the brain processes the perceptual, conceptual, and contextual dimensions of object knowledge over time. Using human similarity judgments of 190 naturalistic object concepts presented as either as images or words, we constructed separate behavioural models of objects perceptual, conceptual, and contextual properties. We correlated these models with neural patterns from two EEG datasets, one publicly available and one newly collected, both recorded while participants passively viewed the same object stimuli. Across both datasets, we found that perceptual features dominated the early EEG response to object images, while conceptual features emerged later. Contextual associations were also reflected in neural patterns, but their explanatory power largely overlapped with that of conceptual models, suggesting limited unique representation of objects contextual attributes under passive viewing conditions. These results highlight the brains integration of perceptual and conceptual information when processing visual objects. By combining high temporal resolution EEG with behaviourally derived models, this study advances our understanding of how distinct dimensions of object knowledge are encoded in the human brain."
"Bioinformatics and cheminformatics are established disciplines, but nanoinformatics, the development of computational tools for understanding and designing nanomaterials, is still in its infancy. In light of the new data-driven approaches for nanomaterials discovery, there is a growing need for in silico tools tailored to analyze nanomaterials datasets. This is particularly crucial for soft materials, where a crystalline structure cannot be obtained and therefore the characterization datasets are less structured, and there are no standard methods for data mining. Here we present a computational package capable of visualizing, describing, and comparing nanoparticle datasets obtained with super-resolution microscopy at the single-particle and single-molecule level. Our method allows us to: i) visualize multiparametric nanoparticle datasets to grasp material properties and heterogeneity; ii) have a quantitative evaluation of a material through a series of molecular descriptors, and iii) compare different materials quantitatively and globally, going beyond comparison of a single property.

We applied this method to a library of targeted nanoparticles revealing particle heterogeneity, similarities, and correlations between the synthesis and the physicochemical properties of the different nanomaterials. Finally, we show the potential of this approach to reveal batch-to-batch variations in time and between users hidden in standard analysis."
"The rapid development of single-cell sequencing offers an unparalleled opportunity to delineate the heterogeneity of individual cells. However, current methods struggle to pinpoint the states of cell fate decisions. In this study, we introduce a novel approach called Single-cell Reinforcement Learning (scRL), which integrates reinforcement learning into single-cell data analysis using an actor-critic architecture. Among existing dimensionality reduction methods, we identified one with the best interpretability. Based on this latent space and combined with our scRL algorithm, we assessed the intensity of fate decisions at the single-cell level. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that scRL outperforms existing techniques, as well as their variants and alternative approaches, in assessing cell fate decisions. Moreover, scRL offers an alternative method for evaluating the intensity of cell lineage differentiation which shows competitive interpretability as well. The superiority of scRL in assessing fate decisions is confirmed across several types of single-cell datasets."
"High-dimensional sequencing data, such as RNA-Seq for gene expression and ATAC-Seq for chromatin accessibility, are widely used in studying systems biology. Accessible chromatin allows transcription factors and regulatory elements to bind to DNA, thereby regulating transcription through the activation or repression of target genes. The association analysis of RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq data provides insights into gene regulatory mechanisms. Most existing analytic tools exclusively focus on cis-associations, despite regulatory elements being able to physically interact with distant target genes. Furthermore, conventional approaches often utilize Pearson or Spearman correlations, which ignore the count-based nature of RNA-Seq data.

To address these limitations, we introduce PETScan, a computationally efficient genome-wide PEak-Transcript Score-based association analysis, utilizing negative binomial models to better accommodate RNA-Seq data. We leverage score tests and matrix calculations for improved computational efficiency, and combine an empirical permutation method with genomic control to ensure valid p-value calculations in studies with limited sample sizes. In real-world datasets, PETScan achieved three orders of magnitude faster than Wald tests, while identifying similar significant gene-peak pairs. The PETScan R package is available on GitHub at https://github.com/yajing-hao/PETScan."
"Recording and quantifying ecological interactions is vital for understanding biodiversity, ecosystem stability, and resilience. Camera traps have become a key tool for documenting plant-animal interactions, especially when combined with computer vision (CV) technology to handle large datasets. However, creating comprehensive ecological interaction databases remains challenging due to labor-intensive processes and a lack of standardization. While CV aids in data processing, it has limitations, including information loss, which can impact subsequent analyses.

This study presents a detailed methodology to streamline the creation of robust ecological interaction databases using CV-enhanced tools. It highlights potential pitfalls in applying CV models across different contexts, particularly for specific plant and animal species. The approach aligns with existing camera trap standards and incorporates complex network analysis tools. It also addresses a gap in ecological research by extending the methodology to behavioral studies using video-based image recognition, as most current studies rely on still images.

The study evaluates CVs performance in estimating species interaction frequency (PIE) and its ecological implications, with examples of plant-frugivores interactions for seed dispersal. Results show that up to 10% of pairwise interactions may be missed with CV, with information loss varying among focal species and individual plants. This poses challenges for individual-based approaches, where unbiased data collection requires extra caution. However, the loss is minimal compared to the vast data CV enables researchers to gather. For community-level approaches, only three out of 344 unique pairwise interactions were missed, and overall estimates of both PIEs and interaction strengths remained largely unaffected.

The methodology provides a valuable resource for ecologists seeking to document ecological interactions efficiently. It offers guidelines for collecting reliable data while addressing CVs limitations in capturing unbiased species interaction data. Despite its constraints, CV significantly enhances the ability to gather large-scale interaction data, particularly at the community level, making it an indispensable tool for ecological research."
"The outer membrane factor TolC is an essential component of various efflux pump complexes in E. coli and represents a potential target for antibiotic adjuvants. By means of a virtual screen for TolC-binding compounds, we identified the kinase inhibitor CEP- 37440 to shift the minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics piperacillin and levofloxacin in E. coli. To determine the substructure relevant for TolC binding, a hit deconstruction approach was applied, resulting in a fragment-like compound with low affinity for TolC and AcrB (LP-115). Dynamic light scattering revealed LP-115 to reduce the hydrodynamic radius of AcrABZ-TolC, indicating a disassembly of the efflux pump complex. A cryo-EM structure demonstrated LP-115 to bind at the TolC-AcrA interface within the AcrABZ-TolC complex, thereby disordering the interface and inducing a closed conformation of TolC. Our results suggest that ligand-mediated TolC-AcrA interface disruption represents a novel mechanism of efflux pump inhibition."
"The Glial Cells Missing (GCM) genes were first discovered in Drosophila and encode transcription factors important for gliogenesis. In placental mammals, GCM1 regulates several genes that are important for early placenta development, while its paralog GCM2 is important for parathyroid gland development. The egg-laying monotremes, which represent the most diverged extant mammalian lineage, undergo a short period of intrauterine development and form a simple placenta. To gain more insight into the evolution of GCM genes we analysed the sequence, expression, and genomic localization of GCM1 and GCM2 genes in the platypus and echidna. We found that the chromosomal localisation of GCM1 changed after the divergence of therian mammals, coinciding with the evolution of a complex placenta. Expression analysis revealed the presence of GCM transcripts in male and female monotreme gonads, as well as expression of GCM1 in the female reproductive tract. GCM binding sites in target genes associated with placental development in therian mammals were also present in the monotremes and the chicken. Together, this suggests that the role of GCM1 in the placenta emerged early in mammalian evolution."
"Nectar-dwelling yeasts modulate the ecology of interactions between flowers and pollinators. We evaluate here the hypothesis that floral nectar traits, which are a central element in most plant-pollinator relationships, can largely represent the extended fungal phenotypes of nectar-dwelling yeasts. The following specific question is addressed, Do local genotypes of the specialist nectar yeast Metschnikowia reukaufii have the ability to obfuscate intrinsic individual variation among Helleborus foetidus plants in nectar sugar concentration ? An array of paired plant-yeast genotypes mimicking a natural field situation was created in the laboratory by inoculating field-collected nectar from different plant individuals with distinct yeast genotypes following a factorial design. Chemical analyses of nectar sugars before and after exposure to yeasts were performed using ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography. Plant individual, yeast genotype, and their interaction all had strong, significant effects on sucrose concentration of H. foetidus nectar. Yeasts abolished 79% of intrinsic variance among plants in nectar sucrose concentration and profoundly reshaped patterns of intrinsic among-plant variation. Our results support the hypothesis that among-plant variation in nectar sugar concentration found by pollinators in the field can sometimes reflect the extended phenotypes of nectar yeasts more closely than intrinsic differences among the plants themselves."
"In many behavioral conditions, neural activity propagates within and across brain regions as traveling waves, revealing the importance of analyzing spatiotemporal dynamics in electrophysiological data. Most methods quantify such propagation by measuring spatial phase gradients, i.e., monotonic and ordered phase changes through space. Here, we demonstrate that the phase ordering in travelling waves is insufficient to determine the effective flow of information unambiguously. We demonstrate that, in some specific cases, the phase gradient indicates information propagation in the opposite direction than indicated by methods for causal inference. Using autoregressive modeling, we further show that such a discrepancy between the effective waves and the apparent waves measured via phase-based methods can, for example, be predicted by the sign of the projection from the lower to the higher nodes in the hierarchy. Together with an input signal in the lowest node, inhibitory bottom-up connections produce apparent waves propagating in the opposite, top-down direction. As a methodological solution, we show that Granger causality analysis can recover the information flow and its underlying causal structure, which can be used to disambiguate the ""effective"" flow."
"In addition to individual genetics, environmental factors (e.g., dietary changes) may influence host susceptibility to gastrointestinal infection through unknown mechanisms. Herein, we developed a model in which CBA/J mice, a genetically resistant strain that tolerates intestinal colonization by the enteric pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Tm), rapidly succumb to infection after exposure to a diet rich in L-amino acids (AA). In mice, S. Tm-gastroenteritis is restricted to the large intestine (cecum), limiting their use to understand S. Tm small intestine (ileum) colonization, a feature of human Salmonellosis. Surprisingly, CBA mice fed AA diet developed ileitis with enhanced S. Tm ileal colonization. Using germ-free mice and ileal-fecal slurry transplant, we found diet-mediated S. Tm ileal expansion to be microbiota-dependent. Mechanistically, S. Tm relied on Fructosyl-asparagine utilization to expand in the ileum during infection. We demonstrate how AA diet overrides host genetics by altering the gut microbiotas ability to prevent S. Tm ileal colonization."
"Trypanosoma cruzi, the causing agent of Chagas disease, is the only known trypanosomatid pathogenic to humans having a complete histidine to glutamate pathway, which involves a series of four enzymatic reactions that convert histidine into downstream metabolites, including urocanate, 4-imidazolone-5-propionate, N-formimino-L-glutamate and L-glutamate. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of this pathway in ATP production, redox balance, and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis in T. cruzi. In this work, we focus on the first step of the histidine degradation pathway, which is performed by the enzyme histidine ammonia lyase. Here we determined the kinetic and biochemical parameters of the T. cruzi histidine ammonia-lyase. By generating null mutants of this enzyme using CRISPR-Cas9 we observed that disruption of the first step of the histidine degradation pathway completely abolishes the capability of this parasite to metabolise histidine, compromising the use of this amino acid as an energy and carbon source. Additionally, we showed that the knockout of the histidine ammonia lyase affects metacyclogenesis when histidine is the only metabolizable source and diminishes trypomastigote infection in vitro."
"People differ in how quickly they learn and adapt sensorimotor skills, and these differences have been linked to individual variation in working memory capacity (WMc). In tasks that can be supported by cognitive strategies, visuospatial WMc has been proposed as a key contributor. However, it remains unclear whether this association reflects domain-specific mechanisms or domain-general executive resources, and whether it extends beyond spatial memory to other visual features. Here, we systematically tested whether domain-specific or domain-general WMc predicts adaptation across three visuomotor adaptation (VMA) tasks known to differentially engage explicit and implicit learning systems. After obtaining independent measures of spatial and feature-based WMc, healthy subjects completed (1) a standard VMA task, which engages both explicit and implicit learning systems; (2) a delayed feedback VMA task, which isolates explicit learning; and (3) a clamped feedback VMA task, which isolates implicit learning. Our results provide converging evidence in support of a domain-specific association between spatial WMc and individual differences in learning. In Experiments 1 and 2, greater spatial WMc was associated with robust increases in explicit learning whereas featured-based WMc was not associated with learning outcomes. Surprisingly, in Experiment 3, greater spatial WMc was associated with reduced implicit learning, suggesting an interaction between latent cognitive capacities and implicit learning not accounted for by traditional models. These results shed light on the precise cognitive mechanisms underlying sensorimotor adaptation and provide novel insight into domain-specific links between spatial WM and motor learning."
"The ability of neural circuits to generate multiple outputs is critical for behavioral flexibility. Here, we leverage the rich vocal behavior of the singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina) to investigate the organizational logic of multifunctional motor circuits. We show that two distinct vocal modes--soft, unstructured ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) for short-range and loud, rhythmic songs for long-range communication--arise not via parallel pathways but through shared brainstem phonatory circuitry involving the caudolateral periaqueductual gray (clPAG). Using a three-parameter linear model of song rhythm, we demonstrate that synaptic silencing of clPAG progressively alters song duration through a single parameter controlling its termination. This parameter also explains sexual dimorphism in songs, identifying clPAG as a key locus for driving natural behavioral variability. Our findings reveal how parametric modulation of a central circuit node can produce distinct behavioral modes, providing a mechanistic basis for rapid behavioral evolution in mammals."
"Unscheduled whole genome duplication (WGD), also described as unscheduled or non-physiological polyploidy, can lead to genetic instability and is commonly observed in human cancers. WGD generates DNA damage due to scaling defects between replication factors and DNA content. As a result, DNA damage repair mechanisms are thought to be critical for ensuring cell viability and proliferation under these conditions. In this study, we explored the role of homologous recombination and Holliday junction resolution in non-physiological polyploidy in vivo. Using Drosophila genetics and high-resolution imaging, we identified a key and surprising role for Gen/Gen1 nuclease. Our findings revealed that loss-of-function and overexpression of Gen have opposing effects, delaying or accelerating the proliferation of polyploid cells, respectively. These changes ultimately impact cell proliferation, nuclear asynchrony and mitotic DNA damage levels. Surprisingly, our findings show that this effect is unrelated with the expected Gens function in DNA damage repair. Instead, Gen seems to influence polyploid DNA replication rates. This work identifies a novel function for Gen nuclease and provides new insights into the cellular and molecular requirements of non-physiological polyploidy."
"Increasing droughts threaten soil microbial communities and the multiple functions they control in agricultural soils. These soils are often fertilized with mineral nutrients, but it remains unclear how this fertilization may alter the capacity of soil multifunctionality (SMF) to be maintained under drought, and how plant-soil interactions shape these effects. In this study, we used a mountain grassland soil to test the interactive effect of mineral nutrient (Nitrogen and Phosphorous) addition and drought on SMF with and without plants (Lolium perenne) in a mesocosm experiment. We calculated SMF based on 8 microbial properties associated with the capacity of soil microbes to store carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in their biomass, and to process these elements through organic matter depolymerization, mineralization, nitrification and denitrification processes. To investigate mechanisms underlying the SMF response we characterized the associated changes in soil stoichiometry and microbial community composition using 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Our results showed that fertilization decreased the SMF drought resistance when plants were present, but the opposite was observed in the unplanted mountain grassland soil. Our analysis suggested this was due to the interaction of plants, fertilization and drought in influencing four coupled properties related to high SMF: high soil moisture, low microbial C limitation, high bacterial diversity and low bacteria gram positive:gram negative ratio. Altogether, our results suggested that reducing the use of mineral fertilizer for plant production in mountain grassland could improve the ability of their soils to maintain their multifunctionality during drought period. Finally, our study clearly further demonstrated the importance of plant in the complex responses of SMF to global changes and showed that combining stoichiometric and microbial diversity assessment represents a powerful approach to disentangle the underlying mechanisms."
"Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium, is the leading microbial insecticide used in both organic and conventional agriculture to fight lepidopteran larvae. Bt insecticides, which consist of a mix of Bt spores and crystals of entomopathogenic toxins (Cry toxins), kill target pest larvae rapidly after ingestion by destroying their intestinal epithelium. The potential adverse effects of chronic consumption of Bt spores by non-target organisms have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, using adult Drosophila melanogaster, a non-target dipteran organism of Bt insecticides, we show that chronic ingestion of agricultural doses of spores in the diet reduces lifespan. Our results demonstrate that Bt spore ingestion affects gut morphology, promotes dysplasia, alters septate junctions and enhances epithelial permeability. In addition, we observed increased levels of inflammatory signaling pathways and reactive oxygen species. Taken together, our results indicate that chronic consumption of Bt spores promotes inflammation and oxidative stress, leading to premature aging of the gut and early lethality in Drosophila. Extended to non-target insects, which account for 85% of animal biodiversity, our study suggests that highly persistent Bt spores may have unintended long-term effects on the environment."
"Synchronizing protein structure predictions with sequence databases is crucial for their accuracy. We developed AlphaSync (alphasync.stjude.org), a pipeline and database that provides updated AlphaFold structure models for currently 39,961 UniProt proteins, including isoforms. Moreover, AlphaSync enhances 2.6 million structures with residue-level features, including solvent accessibility, dihedral angles, intrinsic disorder predictions, and 4.7 billion atom-level noncovalent contacts. AlphaSyncs user-friendly interface enables structural analyses at scale across up-to-date proteomes for 42 species."
"Adaptively modulated cancer therapies, integrating evolutionary models of intra-tumor competition with clinical surveillance, have emerged as a promising new approach to delay resistance-mediated therapy failure in metastatic malignancies, a primary cause of cancer related deaths. Yet, how to integrate the highly-complex, physics-driven collective dynamics shaping solid tumor growth and therapy response into this approach remains unclear. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful new paradigm for strategy optimization in such highly-complex environments. However, discovery and abstraction of emergent mechanism, often the key to the successful training of decision-making agents, represents a critical hurdle. Here, we present Group-Relative Agent Policy Evaluation for Varying INterpretable Environments (GRAPEVINE), an artificial scientific discovery framework for uncovering hidden emergent processes. At its core, GRAPEVINE builds on Reinforcement Failing (RF), a novel concept that systematically examines the failure modes of an ensemble of independently trained agents. We show how the resulting RL-guided, human-in-the-loop augmentation of the training environment not only boosts agent performance but additionally allows for the injection of existing scientific knowledge while maintaining mechanistic interpretability of key dynamics. We demonstrate the power of this approach in the context of adaptive tumor therapy by uncovering the critical role of position-dependent growth and mechanically-induced motion of resistant mutants. Together, these findings illustrate the potential of GRAPEVINE as a powerful artificial scientific discovery engine for deciphering high-complexity processes in personalized cancer treatment and beyond."
"With AlphaFold achieving high-accuracy tertiary structure prediction for most single-chain proteins (monomers), the next major challenge in protein structure prediction is accurately modeling multi-chain protein complexes (multimers). We developed MULTICOM4, the latest version of the MULTICOM system, to improve protein complex structure prediction by integrating transformer-based AlphaFold2, diffusion model-based AlphaFold3, and our in-house techniques. These include protein complex stoichiometry prediction, diverse multiple sequence alignment (MSA) generation leveraging both sequence and structure comparison, modeling exception handling, and deep learning-based model quality assessment.

MULTICOM4was blindly evaluated in the 16th communitywide Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP16) in 2024. In Phase 0 of CASP16, where stoichiometry information was unavailable, MULTICOM predictors performed best, with MULTICOM_human achieving a TM-score of 0.752 and a DockQ score of 0.584 for top-ranked predictions on average. In Phase 1 of CASP16, with stoichiometry information provided, MULTICOM_human remained among the top predictors, attaining a TM-score of 0.797 and a DockQ score of 0.558 on average. The CASP16 results demonstrate that integrating complementary AlphaFold2 and 3 with enhanced MSA inputs, comprehensive model ranking, exception handling, and accurate stoichiometry prediction can effectively improve protein complex structure prediction."
"Bursty protein production is a key source of gene expression noise. In this study, we analyze a Markovian model of cellular protein dynamics, where proteins are produced in geometrically distributed bursts. Extending this model, we incorporate a feedback mechanism by assuming that higher protein levels reduce both cell growth and protein decay rates. We study both single-cell dynamics and an expanding cell population. Without feedback, the protein level follows a negative binomial distribution with the same parameters in both cases. With feedback, however, single-cell and population-level distributions differ, each expressible as a mixture of two negative binomial distributions with framework-dependent parameters. Using numerical integration of the master and population balance equations, we calculate the time-dependent distributions in both settings. This work extends previous continuous models and provides new insights into how population expansion influences intrinsic cellular heterogeneity."
"Many species of bacteria produce small-molecule antibiotics that enter and kill a wide range of competitor microbes. However, diffusible antibacterial proteins that share this broad-spectrum activity are not known to exist. Here, we report a family of proteins widespread in Gram-positive bacteria that display potent antibacterial activity against a diverse range of target organisms. Upon entering susceptible cells, these antibacterial proteins (ABPs) enzymatically degrade essential cellular components including DNA, tRNA, and rRNA. Unlike previously characterized bactericidal proteins, which require a specific cell surface receptor and therefore display a narrow spectrum of activity, we find that ABPs act in a receptor-independent manner and consequently kill bacteria spanning multiple bacterial phyla. Target cell entry by ABPs requires proteolytic activation by a cognate, co-exported serine protease and the liberated toxin component of the cleaved ABP is driven across the target cell membrane by the proton motive force. By examining representative ABPs from diverse pathogenic, commensal, and environmental bacteria, we show that broad-spectrum antibacterial activity is a conserved property of this protein family. Collectively, our work demonstrates that secreted proteins can act as broad-spectrum antibiotics, suggesting that ABPs represent one of potentially many such families produced in nature.

Significance StatementMany bacteria produce proteins with antibacterial properties. However, owing to their reliance on a specific surface receptor for target cell entry, all known antibacterial proteins are only active against a narrow range of organisms. Using biochemical and genetic approaches, this study reports the discovery of a new family of antibacterial proteins secreted by many Gram-positive bacteria that enter and kill a broad spectrum of bacteria. Entry of these proteins into susceptible bacteria does not require a receptor and instead relies on cleavage by a co-secreted protease and the proton motive force of the target cell. Overall, our findings reveal a new family of antibacterial proteins and provides insight into how these proteins enter and kill a broad range of bacteria."
"We combine ultra-high-resolution fMRI with machine learning predictions to investigate the neural correlates of image memorability. Using ViTMem, a visual transformer-based tool, we estimated memorability scores for over 70,000 natural scenes from the NSD dataset. Our analyses reveal that higher memorability scores correlate with increased activation in ventral visual regions (fusiform gyrus, middle occipital cortex) and medial temporal areas (hippocampus, amygdala). Notably, we also observed significant engagement in fronto-parietal regions, indicating a broader network involved in modulating memory encoding. These novel findings demonstrate that ViTMem not only reliably predicts stimulus memorability but also provides a powerful framework for scalable investigations into the neural mechanisms underlying perceptual and mnemonic processes."
"In vivo genome editing for hematologic malignancies is limited by inefficient delivery of genome editors to hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the bone marrow. To overcome this limitation, we capitalized on the inherent liver tropism of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and the liver niche of fetal HSCs. We demonstrate that in utero delivery of LNPs without active targeting ligands to the fetal liver results in potentially therapeutic levels of HSC editing."
"Proteogenomics is limited by challenges of modeling the complexities of gene expression. We create moPepGen, a graph-based algorithm that comprehensively generates non-canonical peptides in linear time. moPepGen works with multiple technologies, in multiple species and on all types of genetic and transcriptomic data. In human cancer proteomes, it enumerates previously unobservable noncanonical peptides arising from germline and somatic genomic variants, noncoding open reading frames, RNA fusions and RNA circularization."
"The plasticity of ionotropic receptors (mainly AMPARs and NMDARs) within the glutamatergic system has long been investigated as a mechanism for physiological and pathological adaptive learning. The tetrameric delta glutamate receptors ({delta}GluRs, GluD1 and GluD2) are homologs of the AMPARs and NMDARs, however they are insensitive to glutamate. These proteins, especially GluD1, have been implicated in multiple psychiatric conditions and play a functional role in synapses assembly and stability, but recent evidence suggests they also may supply a tonic excitatory conductance, are sensitive to poly-amine blockade, and regulate synaptic plasticity. Here we use whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology to functionally characterize these receptors in the dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dlBNST) and investigate their modulation of both synaptic transmission and cell excitability. Our results suggest that {delta}GluRs, and in particular GluD1, carry a tonic conductance, modulate excitatory synapses, and regulate cell excitability in the dlBNST. These results imply that GluD1 functions to regulate the flow of information through the BNST and may play a role in affect, stress, and substance use disorders."
"Facial color is closely linked to the perception of emotion, with reddish tones often associated with anger. While previous studies have shown that static reddish facial tones enhance this perception, it remains unclear whether dynamic changes in facial color further amplify this effect. This study investigated how variations in facial color influence the perception of expression using a judgment task that involved morphed facial stimuli (fearful to angry). The participants evaluated facial expressions under two conditions: faces with dynamic color changes and faces with static colors. Experiment 1 compared red (CIELAB a*+) faces to original-colored faces, and Experiment 2 compared green (a*-) faces to original-colored faces. Neither experiment revealed significant differences between dynamic and static facial colors. However, faces with a final reddish color (higher a* value) were more likely to be perceived as angry. These findings suggest that the final facial color influences the perception of anger independent of whether the color change is dynamic or static. Our findings support the idea that the recognition of anger is modulated by the relationship between an angry expression and the color red and provide a new perspective on facial color changes in the interaction between facial expression and facial color."
"Inducible translocation to subcellular compartments is a common strategy for protein switches that control a variety of cell behaviors. However, existing switches achieve translocation through induced dimerization, requiring constitutive anchoring of one component into the target compartment and optimization of relative expression levels between the two components. We present a simpler, single-component strategy called Avidity-assisted targeting (Aviatar). Aviatar achieves translocation with only a single protein by converting low-affinity monomers into high-avidity assemblies through inducible clustering. We demonstrated the Aviatar concept and its generality using optogenetic clustering to drive translocation to the plasma membrane, endosomes, golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and microtubules using binding domains for lipids or endogenous proteins that were specific to those compartments. Aviatar recruitment regulated actin polymerization at the cell periphery and revealed compartment-specific signaling of receptor tyrosine kinase fusions associated with cancer. Finally, GFP-targeting Aviatar probes allowed inducible localization to any GFP-tagged target, including endogenously-tagged stress granule proteins. Aviatar is a straightforward platform that can be rapidly adapted to a broad array of targets without the need for their prior modification or disruption."
"The plant cell wall, a highly abundant renewable resource, remains insufficiently understood in terms of its structure, particularly the architecture of cellulose microfibrils and their interactions with hemicellulose and lignin, which impede the development of efficient downstream conversion. Here we present an alternative model of xylan-bound cellulose microfibril architecture in the cell wall of intact wheat straw, using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) coupled with X-ray scattering techniques. We show that the spectroscopic and scattering data can be fit to a simple elementary microfibril consisting of 18 glucan chains, with additional contributions from 0 to 4 tightly bound flat-ribbon xylan chains across the cellulose fibril axis. These xylan-bound cellulose microfibrils are found to serve as the secondary interaction site with lignin, following the non-flat xylan domains. The loose packing of these xylan-bound cellulose fibrils results in a heterogenous hydration landscape within the cell wall, allowing water penetration while maintaining structural integrity through numerous physical contacts between the polymers. This study provides a potential framework to reconcile the mounting biochemical evidence supporting the 18-chain elementary cellulose microfibril model and cellulose synthase complex with the oversized observations from characterization techniques, which report averaged structures influenced by microfibril coalescence and hemicellulose binding. The structural insights also offer valuable information regarding recalcitrance and the potential applications of biomass in biorefinery operations."
"The cotton textile industry is based on the material properties of terminally differentiated trichoblasts. Tens of thousands emerge from the seed coat epidermis and march through a reproducible developmental program that includes interconversion between cell-autonomous and tissue-based morphogenesis. Proteomic analyses of purified fibers provide a way to associate molecules with cellular processes that directly affect morphological transitions and material properties of the harvested cells. However, insufficient temporal sampling and poor protein coverage have limited the extent to which proteomic data can predict control mechanisms. Here we quantified the subcellular proteomes of purified fibers daily over a 20-day interval that includes diverse modes of elongation and cell wall remodeling. Thousands of reliable protein abundance profiles were assigned to expression groups and tested for associations with a broad array of phenotypes. These analyses were validated by the presence of proteins with known localization and stage-specific functions and also include novel functional predictions for hundreds of genes with no known function. Integration of proteomic and RNA-sequencing data revealed distinct modes of transcriptional and post-transcriptional control. Collectively proteomics data resource provides a valuable foundation for large-scale gene function predictions and provides a path to engineer cotton fiber material properties."
"Dengue viruses (DENV) infect approximately 400 million people each year, and there are currently no effective therapeutics available. To explore potential starting points for antiviral drug development, we conducted a large-scale crystallographic fragment screen targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain of the non-structural protein 5 (NS5) from DENV serotype 2. Our screening, which involved 1,108 fragments, identified 60 hit compounds across various known binding sites, including the active site, N pocket, and RNA tunnel. Additionally, we discovered a novel binding site and a fragment-binding hotspot in thumb site II. These structural findings open amenable avenues for developing non-nucleoside inhibitors and offer valuable insights for future structure-based drug design aimed at DENV and other flaviviral RdRps."
"Hybrid incompatibility can lead to lethality and sterility of F1 hybrids, contributing to speciation. Here we found that female hybrids between Mus musculus domesticus and Mus spicilegus mice are sterile due to the failure of homologous chromosome separation in oocyte meiosis I, producing aneuploid eggs. This non-separation phenotype was driven by the mis- localization of the cohesin protector, SGO2, along the chromosome arms instead of its typical centromeric enrichment, resulting in cohesin over-protection. The upstream kinase, BUB1, showed a significantly higher activity in hybrid oocytes, explaining SGO2 mis-targeting along the chromosome arm. Higher BUB1 activity was not observed in mitosis, consistent with viable hybrid mice. Cohesion defects were also evident in hybrid mice from another genus, Peromyscus, wherein cohesin protection is weakened. Defective cohesion in oocytes is a leading cause of reduced fertility especially with advanced maternal age. Our work provides evidence that a major cause of human infertility may play a positive role in promoting mammalian speciation."
"Telomeric overhangs, composed of repeating GGGTTA sequences, can fold into multiple G-quadruplex (GQ) structures that are essential for maintaining genomic stability and regulating telomere length. Molecular crowding--a defining feature of the cellular environment--affects folding kinetics, conformation, and stability of individual GQs. However, its influence on the overall architecture and accessibility of telomeric overhangs containing multiple GQs remains largely unexplored. In this study, we employed single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) and FRET-Point Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (FRET-PAINT) to address this question. We examined the accessibility of telomeric overhangs capable of forming one to six GQs to a short complementary peptide nucleic acid (PNA) imager probe under molecular crowding conditions. These conditions were simulated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules of two different molecular weights: 200 Da (PEG-200) and 6000 Da (PEG-6000). Our results reveal a systematic reduction in the overhang accessibility with increasing PEG concentration--showing approximately a 3-fold reduction at 30% (v/v) PEG-200 and an 8-fold reduction at 30% PEG-6000. We also observed a progressive compaction of the overhang as PEG concentration increased, suggesting molecular crowding promotes architectural condensation, thereby reducing probe accessibility. These findings offer new insights into how the crowded cellular environment may compact telomeric overhangs and modulate their structural and functional properties."
"Humans are altering natural environments at unprecedented rates. Ecological generalism is one of the strongest predictors of survival in light of these changes which, in animals, may be shaped by bold and innovative behaviours. Species with greater habitat generalism are proposed to behave more boldly (e.g., touching and ingesting novel food). Species with greater dietary generalism are proposed to behave more innovatively (e.g., novel problem-solving to access food). Support for both hypotheses exists but remains largely restricted to broad comparisons between generalists and specialists. Further comparative data are needed to understand the extent to which these behavioural patterns might shape more nuanced ecological variation between species, such as species with finer-scale niche differences. We compared bold and innovative behaviour in two wild sympatric generalists, the Northern raccoon (Procyon lotor) and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), using a pull-string task with strings and wires attached to vertical cups containing high-value food. Although both species are broadly classified as generalists, raccoons show relatively greater habitat and dietary flexibility than opossums. Because they live sympatrically, it offers a unique opportunity to test - at the same time and locations - whether these finer-scale niche differences are reflective of differences in their bold and innovative behaviour. We predicted that raccoons would display bolder behaviour (in terms of touching our novel task) and more innovative behaviour (in terms of solving it). We found that both species were equally likely to acknowledge and touch the task, but raccoons were more likely to display innovation to access the food. Raccoons propensity for using innovation to solve novel foraging challenges may contribute to their greater ecological flexibility compared to opossums. More broadly, our findings may help explain differences in how each species adapts to environmental changes.

"SBMLNetwork is an open-source software library that makes the SBML Layout and Render packages practical for standards-based visualization of biochemical models. Current tools often manage model visualization data in custom-designed, tool-specific formats and store it separately from the model itself, hindering interoperability, reproducibility, and the seamless integration of visualization with model data. SBMLNetwork addresses these limitations by building directly on the SBML Layout and Render specifications, automating the generation of standards-compliant visualization data, offering a modular implementation with broad integration support, and providing a robust API tailored to the needs of systems biology researchers. We illustrate the capabilities of SBMLNetwork across key visualization tasks, including SBGN-compliant visualization, application of predefined style templates, layout arrangement to reflect pathway logic, and integration of model data into network diagrams. These examples demonstrate how SBMLNetwork enables high-level visualization features and seamlessly translate user intent into reproducible outputs that support both structural representation and dynamic data visualization within the SBML model.

"Plexin-semaphorin signaling regulates key processes such as cell migration, neuronal development, angiogenesis, and immune responses. Plexins stand out because they can directly bind with both Rho- and Ras-family small GTPases through their intracellular domains when these GTPases are in their active, GTP-bound states. This binding occurs via intracellular regions which include a Rho-GTPase Binding Domain (RBD) and a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) segment. Studies have shown that Rho and Ras GTPases play vital roles in plexin signaling and activation. However, the structural dynamics of plexins and GTPases and how these conformational changes affect interactions when plexin is bound with both Ras and Rho-GTPases or bound to only one specific GTPase has remained unclear.

In this study, we conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on six distinct plexin-GTPase bound systems to investigate the differences in conformations and dynamics between Plexin-B1 and three GTPases: Rap1b, Rnd1, and Rac1. Our analysis revealed that dynamics with Rac1 are more altered, compared to Rnd1 depending on whether plexins GAP domain is bound or unbound to Rap1b. In addition, we further investigated alterations in network centralities and compared the network dynamics of the Plexin-GTPases complexes, focusing on the differences when Plexin is bound to both Ras (Rap1b) and Rho-GTPases (Rnd1/Rac1) versus when it is bound to only one GTPase. Our study revealed that Rnd1 exhibits stronger and more stable interactions with Plexin-B1 in the absence of Rap1b, while Rac1 shows fewer and less stable connections in comparison. These computational models have features that broadly agree with experimental results from hydrogen-deuterium exchange detected by mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). Such insights provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Plexin-GTPase interactions and the complexities of signaling mechanisms involving GTPases in general."
"Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) aims to balance ecological and economic goals while employing precautionary measures to address uncertainties in knowledge and management. This study investigates fishing strategies to achieve this balance while minimizing the associated risks. Using a simplified prey-predator model, we explored various scenarios reflecting the diversity of global fisheries. The model integrates key ecological dynamics (bottom-up and top-down forces), economic factors (price structures), and aggregates the diversity of fishing practices by distributing fishing mortality across species. Our findings reveal that predators are always more affected by fishing than prey, regardless of the effort distribution. High yields are achieved by reducing predator densities--either maximizing predator catches when they are highly valued or reducing predation pressure to enhance prey harvests when prey prices are high. Such strategies result in significant ecological impacts, leading to systematic trade-offs. Elevated prey prices and top-down controlled systems intensify these trade-offs, increasing ecological risks. Regarding uncertainties, we demonstrate that maximizing yields poses risks to both biodiversity and profitability. Reconciliation is challenging but feasible when both species are fished. This balance can be achieved only in bottom-up controlled systems where prey valuation is not disproportionately high compared to predator prices."
"There is currently a public health crisis due to the rise of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis cases, as well as the rise in number of deaths from tuberculosis. To achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of ending the tuberculosis epidemic by 2030, new treatments are urgently required. We previously reported the discovery of 49, a pre-clinical candidate that acted through inhibition of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS). In this report, the full medicinal chemistry program is reviewed from the original hit through to the optimised lead. The work was guided by the first crystal structure of M. tuberculosis LysRS. The physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties were optimised to afford compounds suitable for evaluation in mouse efficacy models of tuberculosis and with the potential for clinical development."
"Wound healing is critical to homeostasis in particular in tissues exposed to environmental insults such as the skin and the intestine. At the intersection of these tissues a particular form of wounding occurs in the form of perianal fistula, i.e. abnormal tracts connecting the intestine with the skin. Importantly, a natural disparity is found in healing efficiency in perianal fistula depending on the underlying medical condition, which is currently not well understood. Using this disparity, we modelled appropriate and defective wound healing by comparing Crohns disease related fistula (poor healing) and non-IBD/idiopathic fistula (well healing). We show that during wound healing, cytokines TNF and IL6 in conjunction with TGF-{beta} induce differentiation of columnar intestinal mucosa into squamous epithelium with high expression of keratins 5 and 13 and WFDC2. Specifically in poorly healing wounds, cytokines including IL17, IL22 and IFN{gamma} induced expression of S100A8/9 in this intestinal derived tissue. Surprisingly, S100A8/9 was not released but rather functioned as a transcriptional (co)regulator, affecting downstream inflammatory mediators such as C3 and CXCL17. These data identify separate immune pathways contributing to healing in general and deficient healing, allowing for more targeted intervention approaches."
"The Visayan Spotted Deer (Rusa alfredi) is an endangered and endemic species in the Philippines facing significant threats from habitat loss and hunting. It is considered as the worlds most threatened deer species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) thus its conservation has been a top priority. Despite its status, there is a notable lack of genomic information available for R. alfredi and the genus Rusa in general. This study presents the first draft genome assembly of the Visayan Spotted Deer (VSD), Rusa alfredi, using Illumina short-read sequencing technology. The RusAlf_1.1 assembly has a 2.52 Gb total length with a contig N50 of 46 Kb and scaffold N50 size of 75 Mb. The assembly has a BUSCO complete score of 95.5%, demonstrating the genomes completeness, and includes the annotation of 24,531 genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on single-copy orthologs reveals a close evolutionary relationship between the R. alfredi and the genus Cervus. The availability of the RusAlf_1.1 genome assembly represents a significant advancement in our understanding of the VSD. It opens opportunities for further research in population genetics and evolutionary biology, which could contribute to more effective conservation and management strategies for this endangered species. This genomic resource can help in assuring the survival of Rusa alfredi in the country."
"Cryptic binding sites in proteins, which are hidden in the absence of a ligand, offer opportunities to modulate targets previously considered  undruggable. However, the scarcity of experimentally validated examples limits the development of predictive tools. Here, we introduce CryptoBank, a large-scale database of cryptic sites identified by applying a machine learning model to detect ligand-induced conformational changes in over 5.5 million structural alignments of unbound (apo) and bound (holo) protein pairs from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Our analysis reveals that cryptic pockets are widespread, occurring in approximately 16.3% of protein clusters. Leveraging this resource, we fine-tuned a protein language model (PLM) to predict cryptic sites directly from protein sequence information. This sequence-based model achieves high precision (PR AUC 0.8) when query sequences share more than 20% identity with CryptoBank entries. Critically, we demonstrate its broader utility by predicting a cryptic site in human TPP1, a protein with less than 20% sequence identity to any CryptoBank entry, and validating its opening using molecular dynamics simulations. CryptoBank and the predictive PLM are publicly accessible via a web server, providing valuable resources for cryptic site discovery and drug development."
"Intracellular molecular organization is often explained by attractive interactions driving clustering and phase separation. Although consideration of repulsive forces is essential in physics, their roles remain unclear in cellular contexts. Here, we demonstrated the fundamental role of repulsion in regulating protein diffusion within cell-size space. By analyzing negatively charged protein diffusion in bulk solutions and in cell-size spaces with membranes, we revealed that membrane-enhanced repulsion inhibited protein diffusion in cell-size spaces. This was due to the amplified electrostatic interactions among proteins because of the large membrane area-to-volume ratio. Notably, ATP, a cellular central energy source, further inhibited protein diffusion in cell-size spaces, whereas protein wave propagation on the membrane counteracted this inhibition. These findings suggest an active regulatory mechanism restoring molecular mobility by dynamically adjusting membrane-enhanced repulsive forces. Our study challenges the traditional emphasis on attractive interactions, highlighting repulsion as a critical tunable factor governing molecular transport and spatial organization in cells.

TeaserProtein diffusion within crowded cell-size spaces is tuned by membrane-enhanced repulsion and its active regulation."
"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a widely used rapid and affordable molecular DNA amplification method with minimal resource requirements. However, visual interpretation of results is subjective and prone to errors, leading to potential false-positive and negative results. To address this limitation, a machine-learning approach is proposed for automated LAMP classification based on digital images. The approach utilizes You Only Look Once (YOLOv8), a fast and robust object detection algorithm to locate and classify tubes within LAMP images, enabling automated categorization as positive or negative. The trained model achieved a high overall accuracy of 95.5% in classifying LAMP images into positive or negative. Additionally, the approach had a 98.0% precision and 92.7% recall for positive cases and 93.4% precision and 98.2% recall for negative cases, demonstrating its potential for real-time LAMP diagnosis and enhanced assay performance. This project demonstrated the platforms suitability for real-time testing, offering an easy operation and rapid results."
"The development of stable antibodies formed by compatible heavy (H) and light (L) chain pairs is crucial in both the in vivo maturation of antibody-producing cells and the ex vivo designs of therapeutic antibodies. We present here a novel machine learning framework, ImmunoMatch, for deciphering the molecular rules governing the pairing of antibody chains. Fine-tuned on an antibody-specific language model, ImmunoMatch learns from paired H and L sequences from single human B cells to distinguish cognate H-L pairs and randomly paired sequences. We find that the predictive performance of ImmunoMatch can be augmented by training separate models on the two types of antibody L chains in humans,{kappa} and{lambda} , in line with the in vivo mechanism of B cell development in the bone marrow. Using ImmunoMatch, we illustrate that refinement of H-L chain pairing is a hallmark of B cell maturation in both healthy and disease conditions. We find further that ImmunoMatch is sensitive to sequence differences at the H-L interface. ImmunoMatch focusses on H-L chain pairing as a specific, under-explored problem in antibody developability, and facilitates the computational assessment and modelling of stably assembled immunoglobulins towards large-scale optimisation of efficacious antibody therapeutics."
"The generation of spatial data in biology has been transformed by multiplex imaging and spatial-omics technologies, such as single cell spatial transcriptomics. These approaches permit a detailed mapping of cell populations and phenotypes within the tissue context, which reveals that tissues are complex ecosystems that include multiple organisational structures over different length scales. Quantitative methods for maximising the information that can be retrieved from these images have not kept pace with technological advances in platforms, and no standard methodology has emerged for spatial data analysis. Proposed pipelines are often tailored to individual studies, leading to a fragmented landscape of available methods, and no clear guidance about which statistical tools are best suited to a particular research question.

In response to these challenges, we present MuSpAn, a Multiscale Spatial Analysis package designed to provide straightforward access to well-established and cutting-edge mathematical tools for analysing spatial data. MuSpAn provides easy to use, flexible, and interactive access to quantitative methods developed from mathematical fields that include spatial statistics, topological data analysis, network theory, geometry, probability and ecology. Users can construct custom pipelines from tools across these fields to address specific biological problems, or conduct unbiased exploration of data for discovery spatial biology. In summary, MuSpAn is an extensive platform which enables multiscale analysis of spatial data, ranging from the subcellular to the tissue-scale."
"Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the development of generative models for de novo protein design. We compared 13 state-of-the-art generative protein models, assessing their ability to produce feasible, diverse, and novel protein monomers. Structural diffusion models generally create designs with higher confidence in predicted structures and more biologically plausible energy distributions, but exhibit limited diversity and strong sequence biases. Conversely, protein language models generate more diverse and novel designs but with lower structural confidence. We also evaluated these models ability to generate unique proteins, conditionally based on the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease. Generative models were successful in producing functional enzymes, albeit with diminished activity compared to the wildtype TEV. Our systematic benchmarking provides a foundation for evaluating and selecting generative protein models, while highlighting the complementary strengths of different generative paradigms. This framework will facilitate an informed application of these tools for bio-medical engineering and design."
"Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have the potential to demonstrate the causal impact of targeted brain regions on specific behaviors, and to regulate or facilitate behavior in clinical applications. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is one form of transcranial electric stimulation (tES) in which an alternating current is passed between electrodes at random frequencies. High-frequency tRNS (hf-tRNS) is thought to enhance excitability and has been reported to have facilitatory effects on behavior in healthy and clinical populations. Due to the potential application of tRNS, clear demonstrations of the efficacy and replicability of stimulation are critical. Here, we focused on replicating the facilitatory effect of hf-tRNS over the human middle temporal complex (hMT+) on contralateral motion processing, initially demonstrated by Ghin et al. (2018). In this prior study, the improvement in performance was specific to global motion processing in the visual field contralateral to stimulation. The motivation to replicate this effect was reinforced by the well-supported hypothesis that hMT+ is critical for contralateral global motion processing. However, our results indicated that hf-tRNS does not improve motion discrimination. Specifically, we were unable to replicate a contralateral global motion processing facilitation following hf-tRNS to hMT+. In our within-subject controls, we also found no difference between hf-tRNS to hMT+ on contralateral global motion processing in comparison to sham stimulation, or in comparison to hf-tRNS to the forehead. While it remains possible that our lack of replication could be due to minor changes in the protocol from the original Ghin et al., study, for hf-tRNS to become a widely applied method, the modulatory effect of hf-tRNS should be robust to slight adjustments to the procedure."
"The structure and deformability of double-stranded DNA and RNA depend on the sequence of bases, affecting biological processes and nanostructure design. Despite intense research, the dependence is incompletely understood. Here we present mechanical properties of DNA and RNA duplexes inferred from atomic-resolution, explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 107 DNA and 107 RNA oligomers containing all hexanucleotide sequences. The sequence-specific parameters include structure and stiffness at the rigid base level, the width and stiffness of major and minor grooves, and global material constants such as stretch modulus, twist rigidity, or bending and twisting persistence lengths. We propose a simple model to predict sequence-dependent shape and harmonic stiffness for arbitrary sequence, validate it on an independent set of MD simulations for DNA and RNA duplexes containing all pentamers, and demonstrate its utility in various applications. The large amount of simulated data enabled us to study rare events, such as base-pair opening lifetimes, or flips of the RNA sugar pucker into the B domain and the related dynamics of the 2-OH group. Together, this work provides a comprehensive sequence-specific description of DNA and RNA duplex mechanics, forming a baseline for further research and allowing for a broad range of applications."
"The active regulation of tissue material properties via phase transitions is central in morphogenesis. Transitions abruptly occur at critical points in diverse control parameters, including cell density, shape or adhesion. Whether these parameters are interdependent, performing redundant or distinct functions, is unknown. Here we show that co-regulation of multiple control parameters impacts not only tissue deformability, but also cell polarization. We theoretically define a new phase diagram capturing the material states of zebrafish pluripotent tissues and show that they cross simultaneously critical points in cell density, connectivity and adhesion strength. Combining optogenetics, biophysical measurements and quantitative morphometrics, we independently modulate each parameter, identifying adhesion as the main determinant of tissue rheology. Unexpectedly, uncoupling adhesion-driven from density-driven rigidification in amorphous tissues triggers epithelial organization via tricellular junction formation, followed by luminogenesis and apicobasal polarization. Altogether, this work reveals the non-linear dynamics of emergent tissue mechanics as instructive mechanisms of tissue organization."
"Protein aggregates are spatially organized and regulated in cells to prevent deleterious effects of proteostatic stress. Misfolding of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) results in aggregate formation, but how the aggregates are processed especially during cell division is not well understood. Here, we induced proteostatic stress and protein aggregation using a proteostasis reporter, which is prone to misfolding and aggregation in the ER. Unexpectedly, we detected solid- like protein aggregates deposited mainly in the nucleus and surrounded by the ER membrane. The membrane-bound aggregates were then cleared as cells progressed through mitosis and cytokinesis. Aggregate clearance depended on Hsp70 family chaperones in the ER, particularly BiP, and proteasomal activity. The clearance culminated at mitotic exit and required cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) inactivation but was independent of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C). The ER reorganization that is active during mitosis and cytokinesis was required for the aggregate clearance. Thus, dividing cells reorganize the ER networks to allow BiP to clear the protein aggregates to maintain proteostasis in the newly divided cells."
"A recurrent neural network fitted to large electrophysiological datasets may help us understand the chain of cortical information transmission. In particular, successful network reconstruction methods should enable a model to predict the response to optogenetic perturbations. We test recurrent neural networks (RNNs) fitted to electrophysiological datasets on unseen optogenetic interventions, and measure that generic RNNs used predominantly in the field generalize poorly on these perturbations. Our alternative RNN model adds biologically informed inductive biases like structured connectivity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and spiking neuron dynamics. We measure that some of the biological inductive biases can improve the model prediction under perturbation in a simulated dataset and a dataset recorded in mice in vivo. Furthermore, we show in simulations that gradients of the fitted RNN can predict the effect of micro-perturbations in the recorded circuits, and discuss potentials for measuring brain gradients or using gradient-targeted stimulation to bias an animal behavior."
"Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 is one of the major causes of disease persistence and mortality in patients with lung pathologies, relying on various host metabolites as carbon and energy sources for growth. The ict-ich-ccl operon (pa0878, pa0882, pa0883) in PAO1 is required for growth on the host molecule itaconate, a C5-dicarboxylate. However, it is not known how itaconate is taken up into P. aeruginosa. Here we demonstrate that a genetically linked tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter (pa0884-pa0886), which is homologous to the known C4-dicarboxylate binding TRAP system, is essential for growth on itaconate, but not for the closely related C4-dicarboxylate succinate. Using tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy we demonstrate that the substrate binding protein, IctP (PA0884), binds itaconate, but still retains higher affinity for the related C4-dicarboxylates. The structures of IctP bound to itaconate (1.80 [A]) and succinate (1.75 [A]), revealed an enclosed ligand binding pocket with ion pairing interactions with the ligand carboxylates. The C2 methylene group that is the distinguishing feature of itaconate compared to succinate is accommodated by a unique change in the IctP binding site from a Leu to Val, which distinguishes it from closely related C4-dicarboxylate binding SBPs. Together these data suggest that this transporter, which we name IctPQM, has duplicated from a canonical C4-dicarboxylate transporter and its evolution towards itaconate specificity enables this pathogen to now access a key metabolite for persistence in the host."
"The ongoing extinction crisis, driven by human activity, poses a significant threat to seabirds and its especially relevant in highly valuable environments such as Antarctica. Among these threats, seabirds face the risk of local extinctions due to emerging infectious diseases like the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus (HPAIV).Progressive spread of HPAIV A/H5N1 outbreaks across South America and the sub-Antarctic islands have been detected, reaching the northern regions of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) during the 2023-2024 season. Here we conducted a comprehensive epidemiological survey conducted on sixteen seabird nesting localities along the WAP from November 2024 to January 2025 to assess the health status of the Antarctic seabirds and detect the presence of HPAIV. We observed unusual mortalities among nesting populations of skuas, with a total of 35 deaths skuas recorded along the WAP and beyond the Antarctic Polar Circle, including Important bird breeding areas around Margarita Bay. HPAIV A/H5 was confirmed in all dead skuas sampled (n=11), from six different locations. This finding represents the southernmost record of seabird mortality in Antarctica related to HPAIV to date. The expansion of HPAIV observed here raises concerns about further spread of avian flu out the Antarctic Peninsula, potentially leading to increased mortality rates in the Antarctic bird populations. These findings are relevant for the assessment of the general health status of Antarctic seabird populations and provide a baseline for the continuous monitoring of the HPAIV spread in avian species during the next breeding seasons."
"Native gel electrophoresis techniques, such as blue or clear native gel electrophoresis (BNE or CNE), are widely used to separate and characterize proteins. However, in high-resolution CNE, mild anionic or neutral detergents are often used at concentrations too low to prevent membrane-protein aggregation. Additionally, the identification of proteins is hampered by the lack of suitable molecular-weight markers, like those used in SDS-PAGE. Here, we introduce a novel approach that combines charged polymer-encapsulated nanodiscs and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to address both challenges. Membrane proteins are first extracted using Glyco-DIBMA, a negatively charged amphiphilic copolymer. This enables the spontaneous formation of nanodiscs harboring the fluorescently labeled target protein within a native-like lipid-bilayer environment, which is confirmed by FCS. The nanodiscs are then subjected to detergent-free CNE. As the number of protomers increases, the nanodiscs grow larger resulting in increased migration distances in CNE due to higher charge densities. Crucially, the nanodiscs remain intact throughout CNE, as demonstrated by FCS analysis of resolubilized bands excised from the gels. Moreover, the membrane proteins used in this study: a potassium channel (KvAP), a sodium channel (NavMs), a water channel (GlpF), and a urea channel (HpUreI) do not aggregate, as shown by the fluorescent brightnesses and diffusion times of individual nanodiscs. Moreover, the oligomeric states of membrane proteins can be deduced from the brightness per nanodisc. Since purified membrane proteins remain within a native-like lipid-bilayer environment and avoid detergent exposure, they are immediately suitable for downstream structural and functional studies."
"Psychiatric disorders are among the most pressing problems of the modern society, with various forms of depression affecting more than 300 millions of people worldwide. Dysfunction of glial cells has consistently been reported in major depressive disorder (MDD); however, no comprehensive resource detailing glial dysfunction is available. To provide insight into neurobiological mechanisms behind severe psychiatric symptoms, we performed transcriptional analysis of post-mortem samples from a subpopulation of suicide completers with previously reported glial abnormalities. We focused on BA25, a subregion of the prefrontal cortex prioritized for targeted medical interventions, due to its metabolic aberrations in disease. We found that a significant portion of genes deregulated in MDD is enriched in glia, with astrocyte-specific genes representing the highest fraction. Then we employed a novel protocol for enriching astrocytic nuclei to provide a detailed molecular signature of astrocytes in MDD. The analysis of the gene set revealed the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a key regulatory transcription factor. We found that astrocyte-specific elimination of the GR in mice largely prevented transcriptional, metabolic and behavioral changes elicited by chronic stress. We also demonstrated that regional manipulation of glutamate turnover in astrocytes suffices to elicit discrete traits of depressive-like behavior. Our data points to astrocytes as a key cellular site of convergence of multiple traits of depression and provide a resource for exploring novel targets for glia-focused therapeutic approaches."
"RNA plays a critical role across numerous biological functions. Recent advances in language modeling show promise with representing RNA, but the possibility of large-scale RNA design and optimization has not been fully explored. We propose EvoFlow-RNA, a bidirectional non-coding RNA language model leveraging a masked discrete diffusion model (MDM) formulation for both generative modeling and representation learning. EvoFlow-RNA bridges the gap between RNA sequence representation and design. It outperforms leading RNA models on three BEACON tasks critical to understanding RNA function, spanning from structure prediction to gene editing. For unconditional generation, it synthesizes diverse RNA sequences with native-like structural and binding properties. Additionally, EvoFlow-RNA can globally redesign aptamer sequences around preserved binding recognition sites with enhanced functionality. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of EvoFlow-RNA in RNA modeling, highlighting the capability and potential of masked discrete diffusion for both recapitulating and enhancing existing RNAs."
"Proteins are crucial in a wide range of biological and engineering processes. Large protein language models (PLMs) can significantly advance our understanding and engineering of proteins. However, the effectiveness of PLMs in prediction and design is largely based on the representations derived from protein sequences. Without incorporating the three-dimensional structures of proteins, PLMs would overlook crucial aspects of how proteins interact with other molecules, thereby limiting their predictive accuracy. To address this issue, we present S-PLM, a 3D structure-aware PLM that employs multi-view contrastive learning to align protein sequences with their 3D structures in a unified latent space. Previously, we utilized a contact map-based approach to encode structural information, applying the Swin-Transformer to contact maps derived from AlphaFold-predicted protein structures. This work introduces a new approach that leverages a Geometric Vector Perceptron (GVP) model to process 3D coordinates and obtain structural embeddings. We focus on the application of structure-aware models for protein-related tasks by utilizing efficient fine-tuning methods to achieve optimal performance without significant computational costs. Our results show that S-PLM outperforms sequence-only PLMs across all protein clustering and classification tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that require both sequence and structure inputs. S-PLM and its tuning tools are available at https://github.com/duolinwang/S-PLM/."
"Genomic resources, new microsatellite markers and a novel observation of a fractal pattern of the genetic population structure are presented for curimba Prochilodus lineatus, a suitable model organism for freshwater migratory species in South America. Our main goals were to investigate the presence of mixed fish stocks, the effects of isolation by dams and broodstocking over the genetic diversity for this species. We focused on the upper segment of the extremely fragmented Grande River, MG, Brazil, from the megadiverse continental La Plata Basin. Two main co-occurring genetically admixed stocks were identified by maximum likelihood estimation and iteratively unfolded with two further steps, through a hierarchical analysis of genetic structure. It consistently unveiled two newly defined internal groups, from the previously resolved clusters (23). We suggest this stratified pattern of mixed stocks from the main river channel may be attributed to the existence of different, well defined breeding grounds, nested within differential scales throughout this basin, arranged according to fractal geometry (1st order river, 2nd and 3rd order tributaries, and so on). This would imply in homing behaviour for this species. Our work also provides massive molecular data for this fish, including its first draft genome assembly and a valuable panel for the rapid and low-cost development of new microsatellite DNA markers. These findings will likely benefit researchers and environmental managers in tackling challenging issues regarding the conservation of Neotropical migratory fishes, as they support the hypothesis of the isolating effects of dams and broodstocking over genetic variability. More importantly, the results presented here point to the potential role of tributaries of different orders in harbouring genetically diverse populations of migratory freshwater fishes."
"SummaryO_LIIn grasses, almost all species belong to two evenly sized clades (BOP and PACMAD), yet the >20 independent origins of C4 photosynthesis in this family only occur in the PACMAD lineage. Here, we identify potential genetic precursors for C4 photosynthesis that were present at the base of the PACMAD clade, representing the last common ancestor of all C4 grasses.
C_LIO_LIWe generated the first reference genomes for Aristidoideae species (Aristida adscensionis and Stipagrostis hirtigluma), the sister lineage of all other PACMAD grasses. In combination with 34 other Poales genomes, we identify gene gains at the base of the PACMAD clade, and genes lost in the sister BOP lineage.
C_LIO_LICandidate C4 precursors include {beta}-carbonic anhydrase, as well as genes involved in amino acid and nitrate transport, carbon metabolism, oxidative stress management and transcription regulation.
C_LIO_LIGene turnover created the necessary genetic contingency, facilitating the independent recruitment and refinement of C4 genes in multiple independent origins. Our results support the idea that the repeated evolution of C4 photosynthesis in PACMAD grasses was not driven by a single genetic event but was instead underwritten by chance genetic changes that originated long before there was selection for the trait itself.

"BackgroundButyrophilins (BTNs) are immunoglobulin superfamily proteins involved in immune regulation. Among them, BTNL9 has unique structural features, including a bZIP-like domain, suggesting a potential transcriptional role. While BTNL9 is known to suppress T cell activation, its function in cancer remains largely unexplored. Recent studies suggest it may inhibit tumor progression and correlate with improved prognosis in multiple cancers. However, its molecular mechanisms and regulatory impact on lung cancer remain unclear. This study investigates the role of BTNL9 as a transcription factor and its implications for tumor progression and therapy.

MethodsChIP-seq identified BTNL9-binding sites, followed by RNA-seq to assess transcriptomic profiles and validated by western blot. Drug sensitivity was evaluated through cytotoxicity assays. A xenograft model was applied to assess the effect of BTNL9 on tumor growth. TCGA data analysis examined correlations with survival, cell cycle regulators, and immune infiltration.

ResultsChIP-seq identified 26,610 BTNL9 binding peaks, mapping to 9,707 genes near transcription start sites. RNA-seq and western blotting showed BTNL9 regulates cell cycle (E2F1, CDKN1A, CDK1, CDC25C, FOXM1), DNA replication (MCM2/3/7, ORC6), and p53-related transcription (BBC3, GADD45A). Integrative analysis found that 74.8% of differentially expressed genes were directly regulated by BTNL9. Functionally, BTNL9 overexpression induced cell cycle arrest, reduced proliferation, and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. BTNL9 enhanced bortezomib sensitivity in both A549 and NCI-H460 cells, with etoposide effects being more pronounced in A549. Higher BTNL9 levels strongly suppressed the expression of FOXM1, CDC25C, CDK1, CDK2, CCNA2 and CCNB1 and negatively correlated with these markers in LUAD TCGA data. Elevated BTNL9 expression was associated with improved survival, complete remission, and increased immune infiltration, including macrophages, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and B cells in cancer tissues.

ConclusionsBTNL9 functions as a transcription factor, suppresses tumor growth, and enhances drug sensitivity. Its correlation with survival and immune infiltration suggests potential role as a tumor suppressor and predictive biomarker for chemotherapy response."
"Macromolecular crowding may strongly affect the dynamics and function of proteins, with intrinsically disordered proteins being particularly sensitive to their crowded environment. To understand the influences of crowding on chain compaction and phase separation behaviour of disordered proteins, both experiments with synthetic crowders--like polyethylene glycol (PEG) and ficoll--and theoretical models and molecular simulation approaches have been applied. Here, we developed a residue-based coarse-grained model for PEG that is compatible with the protein CALVADOS model. To achieve this, we optimised model parameters by comparing simulations with experimental data on single-chain PEG and on PEG-induced compaction of disordered proteins. With our model we show how titrations of PEG can be used to quantify phase separation propensities of proteins that are not prone to phase separate strongly. We illustrate this for both variants of the low-complexity domain of hnRNPA1, and for wild-type and a redesigned variant of -Synuclein. Notably, we observe that the PEG crowding response changes between charge patterning variants of -Synuclein, which is not the case for the variants that vary the number the of aromatic residues in the low-complexity domain of hnRNPA1. We expect that our model will be useful for the interpretation of crowding experiments with disordered proteins, and we envisage it to be a starting point for in-silico explorations of proteins with weak propensities to phase separate."
"In recent years, histopathology foundation models (hFM) have rapidly advanced in size and complexity, achieving excellent performance in tasks such as cancer diagnosis and biomarker discovery. Here, we reveal novel capabilities of these models by specializing hFMs, originally trained on diverse tissue types, specifically to invasive tumor tissue. It enables unprecedented discrimination of visually similar yet molecularly distinct tumor regions, that were previously indistinguishable by baseline models, which eventually leads to uncovering new biological insights into breast cancer. Our contributions are threefold. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate the biological concepts encoded within hFM representations across multiple scales. Second, we explore extended pre-training to identify optimal conditions that enhance the models ability to encode richer, tumor tissue-specific biological concepts. We show that this refinement strategy transforms generalist models into a specialist one capable of resolving subtle, recurrent tumor regions with distinct morphological and molecular identities, called tumor archetypes. Finally, leveraging this specialized model, we uncover two dominant tumor archetypes in invasive breast cancer characterized by distinct aberrant gene expression signatures, notably RNA metabolism dysregulation and TGF-{beta} signaling. Strikingly, these archetypes coexist within the same tumors as spatially distinct regions with varying densities and patterns, and are recurrent across patients, highlighting their universality and potential clinical relevance for patient stratification. Altogether our study demonstrates how extended pre-training of state-of-the-art hFM with specific tumor tissues can unlock rich molecular and morphological information encoded in H&E images. By providing a more accessible approach to investigating tumor heterogeneity, this work opens new avenues for precision oncology, using routine histopathology slides and low computational resources.

"Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) direct precise gene expression for development and environmental response, yet their spatial organization in crops is largely unknown. We introduce Transposase-Accessible Chromosome Conformation Capture (TAC-C), a method integrating ATAC-seq and Hi-C to capture fine-scale chromatin interactions in four major crops: rice, sorghum, maize, and wheat. TAC-C reveals that chromatin interaction frequency aligns with genome size and gene expression, exhibiting distinct loop structures between C3 and C4 plants, particularly in C4-specific enzymes coding genes. Integrating chromatin structure with population genetics data highlights that chromatin loops connect distal regulatory elements to phenotypic variation. Asymmetrical open chromatin interactions among subgenomes, driven by transposon insertions and sequence variations, contribute to biased homoeolog expression. Furthermore, TaSPL7/15 regulate photosynthesis-related genes through chromatin interactions, with enhanced photosynthetic efficiency and starch content in Taspl7&15 mutant. TAC-C provides new insights into the spatial organization of regulatory elements in crops, especially for SPL-mediated photosynthesis regulation in wheat.

"Soils contain diverse predatory protists that affect the abundance and behavior of rhizosphere bacteria, including bacteria that may benefit plant health. Protists also harbor their own bacterial microbiomes, including transient and extracellular associates, but it is not known whether the protist microbiome affects the plant rhizosphere. To address this question, we profiled the bacterial microbiomes of eight evolutionarily diverse rhizosphere protist isolates after two years of continuous laboratory culture. We then compared the protist culture microbiomes to maize rhizosphere communities six weeks after protist inoculation. Introduction of protists enriched 13 protist-associated bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) in the rhizosphere, which comprised [~]10% of the rhizosphere bacterial community. Additional bacterial ASVs ranked highly in abundance in both rhizosphere and protist microbiomes; together, a median 47% of the protist microbiome was enriched or abundant in the rhizosphere. Inoculation with some of the protist cultures positively affected root biomass traits, but a protist mixture had no effect, indicating that the impact of protist holobionts on plant growth is context-dependent. Isolates of protist-associated bacteria had both positive and negative effects on protist growth in culture, suggesting that the bacteria use multiple strategies to survive in proximity to predators. This study demonstrates that even after prolonged laboratory culture, evolutionarily diverse rhizosphere protists host bacterial microbiomes dominated by plant-colonizing bacteria that impact the rhizosphere microbiome after inoculation. The findings suggest that protists may contribute to the rhizosphere as part of the soil microbial seedbank, and identify bacterial groups that may be important to the plant-protist interaction.

ImportanceUnderstanding the impact of predatory protists on the plant microbiome will be essential to deploy protists in sustainable agriculture. This study shows that eight rhizosphere protist isolates hosted diverse and distinct bacterial communities, and that a large proportion of these bacteria could be found colonizing the maize root environment long after protists were introduced. This study demonstrates that maize rhizosphere bacteria can persist for years in the protist microbiome, indicating that extremely diverse eukaryotes could help select and maintain rhizosphere bacteria in the absence of the plant."
"In this paper, we aim to present a new intravital dye, called ABDS, which can be prepared using a marker pen and is useful for eukaryotic cell research. ABDS binds to the cytoplasmic membrane of living cells and can be used for their visualization in biophysical experiments, including Z-stack tomography, cell proliferation monitoring, and adhesion studies. Important properties of ABDS are its availability, bright stable fluorescence, manufacturing simplicity, and safety for living cells in vitro. The paper includes a method for preparing ABDS, a data set with its characteristics, as well as examples of ABDS use in cells investigation."
"Engineering N2-fixing rhizobia symbiosis in cereals and enhancing association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are two strategies being pursued to improve agricultural sustainability. However, the metabolic fluxes and consequent costs and benefits of these strategies in a cereal crop have not been examined. We developed a metabolic model describing how the relative growth rate of Zea mays is impacted by hypothetical association with the rhizobium Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens and the AMF Rhizophagus irregularis. We found that the lower N content of cereal crops makes the relative growth rate cost associated with acquiring nitrogen from N2-fixing rhizobia smaller than in legumes. Our model also predicts positive synergies between rhizobia and AMF under nutrient-limited conditions but negative synergies under nutrient, particularly phosphorus, replete conditions. These findings indicate that these bioengineering strategies could improve cereal crop yields and may achieve greater gains in tandem, but soil nutrient status of target sites should be considered.

Significance StatementFertilizer application is responsible for substantial environmental impacts and represents a significant cost to farmers, both barriers to sustainable agricultural development. Engineering cereal crops to associate with N2-fixing rhizobia and enhancing existing associations between crops and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are two strategies that could address these challenges. However, quantitative predictions of their potential effectiveness have not been determined. We use metabolic modeling to demonstrate that engineering maize to associate with N2-fixing rhizobia could be a highly metabolic and cost-effective strategy for sustainably supplying nitrogen to cereal crops. We also develop and experimentally validate a model of plant-AMF carbon and nutrient exchanges and demonstrate that AMF and rhizobia symbioses can act synergistically under nitrogen- and phosphorus-deprivation to improve crop growth."
"The cofactor Ldb1 (Chip) is linked to many processes in gene regulation, including enhancer-promoter communication, inter-chromosomal interactions and enhanceosome-cofactor-like activity. However, its functional requirement and molecular role during embryogenesis has not been assessed to date. Here, we used optogenetics (iLEXY), to rapidly deplete Drosophila Ldb1 (Chip) from the nucleus at precise time windows. Remarkably, this pinpointed the essential window of Chips function in just one-hour of embryogenesis, overlapping zygotic genome activation (ZGA). We show that Zelda, a pioneer factor essential for ZGA, recruits Chip to chromatin, and both factors regulate concordant changes in gene expression, suggesting that Chip is a cofactor of Zelda. Surprisingly, Chip is not required for chromatin architecture at these stages, instead it recruits CBP, and is essential for the placement of H3K27ac. Taken together, our results identify Chip (Ldb1) as a functional bridge between Zelda and the coactivator CBP to regulate gene expression in early embryogenesis."
"Herbicide target site resistance in polyploid species is more complex than diploids due to potential subgenome interactions and gene dosage of mutations. The objective of this study was to identify the level of resistance and cross-resistance patterns of ALS mutations located in the different subgenomes of allohexaploid Echinochloa crus-galli. E. crus-galli populations were screened and dose-response curves were performed with ALS-inhibitors from different chemical groups. The ALS genes of each subgenome (A, B, and C) were sequenced. Copy number variation, global relative expression, and the specific relative expression of ALS gene from each subgenome were performed. Out of 100 populations, 32% were resistant only to imazethapyr, and 48% were cross-resistant to all ALS-inhibitors. The mutations Ala122Thr, Ala205Asn, and Ser653Asn confer resistance only to imazethapyr, while Trp574Leu confers resistance to all four herbicides tested. ALS mutations were most frequent in subgenome A, but ALS from subgenome C had the highest expression. The biotype SAOJER-01 had Trp574Leu mutation in subgenome C and was 22 times more resistant to imazethapyr and penoxsulam than CAMAQ-01, which had the same Trp574Leu mutation in subgenome A with no differences in herbicide metabolism rate. The ALS genes from subgenomes A and C contribute approximately 13% and 50% respectively to the total ALS transcripts. The higher contribution of subgenome C to the total ALS transcripts pool combined with the Trp574Leu resistance mutation makes the biotype SAOJER-01 more resistant to herbicides than CAMAQ-01. This is the first study showing the effect of subgenome gene expression level on the herbicide resistance level in a polyploid weed species. In addition, while imazethapyr did not control any biotype with an ALS mutation, the other ALS-inhibitor herbicides were able to control biotypes carrying Ala122Thr, Ala205Asn, and Ser653Asn, which reinforces the utility of these herbicides in weed and resistance management."
"Chemical modifications are the standard for small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in therapeutic applications, but predicting their off-target effects remains a significant challenge. Current approaches often rely on sequence-based encodings, which fail to fully capture structural and protein-RNA interaction details critical for off-target prediction. In this study, we developed a framework to generate reproducible structure-based chemical features, incorporating both molecular fingerprints and computationally derived siRNA-AGO2 complex structures. Using an RNA-Seq off-target study, we generated over 30,000 siRNA-gene data points and systematically compared nine distinct types of feature representation strategies. Among the datasets, the highest predictive performance was achieved by Dataset 3, which used extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) to encode siRNA and mRNA features. An energy-minimized dataset (7R), representing siRNA-AGO2 structural alignments, was the second-best performer, underscoring the value of incorporating reproducible structural information into feature engineering. Our findings demonstrate that combining detailed structural representations with sequence-based features enables the generation of robust, reproducible chemical features for machine learning models, offering a promising path forward for off-target prediction and siRNA therapeutic design."
"Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-{beta} peptide (A{beta}). Decreased A{beta} clearance is observed in sporadic AD patients, suggesting that enhancing A{beta} clearance is a potential therapeutic approach for AD. We identified kallikrein-related peptidase 7 (KLK7) as an astrocyte-derived A{beta}-degrading protease, and its mRNA expression is reduced in AD brains. Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, upregulates KLK7 expression in astrocytes; however, the regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that the NMDA receptor signaling negatively regulates KLK7 mRNA expression via nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B). Inhibition of NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway in astrocytes increases KLK7 expression and promotes A{beta} degradation. Moreover, the mRNA expression level of the NF-{kappa}B family is elevated in AD brains and shows a negative correlation with KLK7 mRNA expression. Finally, the injection of an NF-{kappa}B inhibitor significantly upregulates Klk7 expression and reduces A{beta} levels in vivo. These findings suggest that the NMDA receptor-NF-{kappa}B signaling axis in astrocytes negatively regulates KLK7 expression and modulates KLK7-mediated A{beta} clearance."
"Diversity in plant specialized metabolites plays critical roles in plant-environment interactions. In longer evolutionary scales, e.g. between families or orders, this diversity arises from whole-genome and tandem duplication events. Less is known about the evolutionary patterns shaping chemical diversity at shorter scales, e.g. within a family. Utilizing the aliphatic glucosinolate pathway we explored how the terminal structural modification enzyme GSL-OH evolved across the Brassicaceae and the genomic processes that control presence-absence variation of its products (R)-2-hydroxy-but-3-enyl and (S)-2-hydroxy-but-3-enyl. We implemented a phylo-functional approach where we functionally validated GSL-OH orthologs across the Brassicaceae and used that information to map the genomic origin and trajectory of the loci. This uncovered a complex mechanism involving at least three ancestral loci with extensive gene loss across all species creating unequal retention across the phylogenetic relationships. Convergent evolution in enantiomeric specificity was observed where several independent species had tandem duplicates diverged towards producing the R or S enantiomers. To explore potential biological differences between the enantiomers, we performed Trichoplusia ni insect assays and Botrytis cinerea detached leaf assays. We found that plants with the S enantiomer were more susceptible to B. cinerea infection while plants with the R enantiomer seemed more susceptible to T. ni herbivory. This variation in activity between the precursor and different enantiomeric products may shape the recurrent evolution of their production."
"ObjectivesResting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) is a highly dynamic process that varies across different times of the day within each individual. Although this variability was long considered to be noise, recent evidence suggests it may allow for an optimal adaptation to changes in the environment. However, the way rsFC is shaped on a circadian scale and its association with cognition are still unclear.

MethodsWe analyzed data from 90 late-middle-age participants from the Cognitive Fitness in Aging study (61 women; 50-69y). Participants completed five electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of spontaneous resting-state activity spread over 20h of prolonged wakefulness. Using a temporal multilayer network approach, we characterized the diurnal variations of the dynamic recruitment and integration of resting-state brain networks. We focused on the theta and gamma frequency bands within the default mode network (DMN), central executive network (CEN), and salience network (SN). Additionally, we investigated the relationship recruitment and integration of these network with baseline cognitive performance and at 7-year longitudinal follow-up, as well as with positron emission tomography (PET) early neuropathological markers of Alzheimers disease such as {beta}-amyloid and tau/neuroinflammation.

ResultsDiurnal changes in theta and gamma dynamics were associated with distinct cognitive aspects. Specifically, higher baseline memory performance was associated with higher theta dynamic integration of the SN and the CEN, as well as higher theta dynamic recruitment of the DMN. Moreover, lower longitudinal memory decline at 7-year was associated with higher theta dynamic integration of the SN, CEN, and DMN. In contrast, higher gamma diurnal dynamic integration of the SN and the CEN was associated with lower executive and attentional performance, as well as higher early {beta}-amyloid accumulation, at baseline.

DiscussionThese findings suggest that maintaining a balance between network flexibility and stability throughout the diurnal phase of the circadian cycle may play a crucial role in cognitive aging, with stable theta-band connectivity supporting memory, whereas excessive gamma-band stability in the SN and CEN may contribute to executive decline and early amyloid accumulation. These insights highlight the importance of considering time-of-day in brain rsFC studies, calling for a temporal multilayer approach to capture these dynamic patterns more effectively."
"Mitochondria generate ATP by establishing a proton gradient across the inner membrane, which also drives calcium uptake via the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), while sodium-dependent NCLX (encoded by SLC8B1) facilitates efflux. The absence of severe phenotypes in MCU-knockout models suggests redundant calcium transport mechanisms. We investigated the role of TMBIM5, a potential bidirectional mitochondrial calcium transporter, by generating zebrafish lacking Tmbim5, Slc8b1, or both. tmbim5-knockout fish exhibited growth impairment, muscle atrophy (particularly in slow-twitch fibers), increased brain cell death, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential without altering steady-state mitochondrial calcium levels. slc8b1-deficient fish demonstrated significantly attenuated sodium-dependent calcium efflux and increased larval mortality but were otherwise normal. Surprisingly, tmbim5/mcu and tmbim5/slc8b1 double knockouts were viable with normal Mendelian distribution. tmbim5/slc8b1 double knockouts displayed impaired mitochondrial calcium uptake capacity, diminished calcium efflux, and severely disrupted cristae architecture not observed in single knockouts. These findings suggest that Tmbim5 functions predominantly in mitochondrial calcium efflux rather than influx and indicate that robust compensatory mechanisms maintain mitochondrial calcium homeostasis despite disruption of these transport pathways."
"Infants of many species produce distress calls when in need of parental care. As they mature and gain independence from caregivers, juveniles stop producing infant calls and begin producing adult-like vocalizations in a variety of species-typical contexts. Neonatal mice (Mus musculus) produce ""isolation"" ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) when separated from the nest, and in contrast, adolescent and adult mice produce ""social"" USVs during interactions with conspecifics. Although this transition in vocal behavior is known to occur, its developmental timing remains poorly described. In the current study, we performed longitudinal measurements of mouse USVs to establish the age at which juvenile mice begin producing social USVs. Every 4 days (postnatal day (P)12-P28), USVs were first recorded from individual mice in solo sessions to establish rates of isolation/spontaneous USVs and then were recorded again during interactions between same-sex and opposite-sex pairs of age-matched, socially novel (non-littermate) C57BL/6J mice. We report that juvenile mice begin producing social USVs earlier than previously reported, at ages P20-P24. Moreover, although these early social USVs are produced at low rates compared to adult social USVs, they are nonetheless temporally coordinated with active social interaction. Our characterization of the timing of the transition from isolation USVs to social USVs forms a foundation to investigate brain mechanisms that enable the context-dependent regulation of vocal communication over development."
"Aging is marked by the accumulation of senescent cells (SnCs), which contribute to tissue dysfunction and age-related diseases. Senotherapeutics, including senolytics which specifically induce lysis of SnCs and senomorphics, which suppress the senescence phenotype, represent promising therapeutic interventions for mitigating age-related pathologies and extending healthspan. Using a phenotypic-based senescent cell screening assay, we identified fucoidans, a class of sulfated polysaccharides derived from brown algae and seaweed, as novel senotherapeutics. In particular, fucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus (Fucoidan-FV) displayed potent senomorphic activity in different types of SnCs, reduced senescence in multiple tissues in aged mice, and extended healthspan in a mouse model of accelerated aging. Fucoidan-FV also enhanced the deacetylation and mono-ADP-ribosylation (mADPr) activity of SIRT6 and improved DNA repair and reduced senescence, in part, through SIRT6-dependent pathways. In addition, Fucoidan-FV downregulated genes associated with inflammation, Wnt signaling, and ECM remodeling pathways in SnCs and increased expression of genes involved with DNA repair. These findings support the translational potential of fucoidans as novel senotherapeutics that also are able to improve SIRT6-mediated DNA repair."
"IntroductionCandida spp. bloodstream infection is a frequent form of mycosis with high mortality rates. Biofilm formation is a potent virulence factor for Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis, that confers significant resistance to antifungal agents and to the innate immune response. Echinocandins such as anidulafungin are new drugs that broaden the available therapeutic arsenal for invasive fungal infection treatment. Here we evaluated the effect of anidulafungin, human-Monocytes and combined treatment on mature biofilms of clinical isolates of Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis with different intrinsic capacity to form biofilm, and on biofilm with low (LB) and high biomass (HB).

MethodsYeasts from blood isolates were molecularly identified. Lipase and acid aspartic protease production, adhesion capacity, and ability to form biofilm were evaluated; strains were classified as Weak, Moderate or Strong biofilm forming capacity. Mature biofilm with LB and HB were incubated with anidulafungin, THP-1 cell alone or exposed to both, for 22 h. Fungal damage induced by antifungal agents and/or monocytes was determined by XTT[2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl) 2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide] metabolic assay.

ResultsOur results showed that anidulafungin alone could be effective to reduce mature biofilms with LB of most of the C. parapsilosis sensu stricto isolates, independent of intrinsic BF capacity of the strain. Anidulafungin in combination with human-Monocytes was effective in biofilm with LB of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis sensu stricto clinical isolates.

ConclusionsThe effectiveness of ANF treatment in biofilm with LB seems to be species specific, since the antifungal agent and monocytes exhibits synergistic activity on C. albicans and C. parapsilosis sensu stricto biofilm."
"Membrane pore-forming proteins (PFPs) form ring-shaped membrane-translocating oligomers on membranes, contributing to infection, immunity, and cell death functions. Binary toxins produced by some bacteria consist of an enzymatic component that acts as a toxin and a membrane-binding component that forms a pore that delivers the enzymatic component into target cells. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has advanced our understanding of these translocation mechanisms by revealing several binary toxin complexes structures. However, the mechanisms underlying the initial pore formation remain unclear. We determined the structures of several oligomeric forms of the membrane-binding component Ib of the Iota toxin from Clostridium perfringens at various stages of pore formation. Structural comparisons revealed how the symmetrically arranged soluble oligomer (prepore) asymmetrically mature into a transmembrane oligomer (pore). These findings enhance our understanding of mechanisms of PFP and provide a structural basis for developing nanodevices using membrane pores.

Significance StatementAlthough the mode of action of pore-forming proteins (PFPs) has been increasingly elucidated, the structural mechanisms underlying their maturation into membrane-spanning pores remain elusive. One of the key challenges is the difficulty in capturing the intermediate states between the soluble prepore and the mature pore, and its structural analysis. In this study, we successfully prepared the super-complex formed by a bacterial toxin PFP. The super-complex inhibited the constituting oligomers to maturate into the pore, which enabled structural determination of multiple intermediate state. Comparative structural analysis revealed that the transition from prepore to pore occurs through stepwise, domino-like conformational changes. The analysis workflow and insights from this study are expected to advance the field of PFP research."
"Understanding ectotherm responses to environmental change is central to coping with many of humanitys current and future challenges in public health, biodiversity conservation, and food security. Complex relationships between abiotic and biotic factors can influence ectotherm abundance and distribution patterns by introducing stage-specific variation in fitness trait responses. Variation in temperature, rainfall, competition, and habitat have all been considered in previous attempts to understand how environmental factors can interact and vary in their relative influence on species maximal population growth rates, rm. However, the combined effects of temperature and humidity on this fundamental metric are poorly understood. We show that variation in relative humidity can influence juvenile trait responses and rms temperature dependence in Anopheles stephensi, an important malaria vector. Our climate suitability maps show that the interactive effects of temperature x humidity on juvenile traits have important implications for predicting how environmental change will influence arthropod-mediated systems."
"Many Gram-negative bacteria use type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) to deliver toxic effector proteins into neighboring competitor cells. Members of the VasX protein family, such as VasX from Vibrio cholerae and Tke5 from Pseudomonas putida, disrupt the inner membrane of target cells by forming ion-permeable channels that dissipate the proton motive force, thereby interfering with essential physiological processes. However, the molecular structure of any VasX family effector has remained unknown. Here, we present a cryo-EM structure of Ptx2, a recently identified VasX family effector exported by a T6SS of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our structure reveals that Ptx2 is an elongated, multi-domain protein that bears little resemblance to proteins of known function. Notably, the apparent flexibility of its domains suggests that Ptx2, like other membrane-depolarizing toxins, undergoes substantial conformational changes to facilitate membrane insertion. Guided by these predicted structural rearrangements, we used mutagenesis coupled with phenotypic assays to identify key features required for its toxic activity. Together, these findings provide the first molecular level insights into the structure and mechanism of VasX family effectors and expand our understanding of how these proteins contribute to interbacterial antagonism."
"Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) has revolutionized high-resolution imaging, but the simultaneous detection of multiple fluorophores traditionally relies on spectral-based separation, which is inherently constrained by spectral overlap. Here, we introduce Brightness Demixing, a novel method for fluorophore discrimination that exploits brightness, which directly depends on the fluorophores extinction coefficient and quantum yield. By oversampling blinking events, we precisely quantify photon flux as a proxy for brightness, enabling robust differentiation of fluorophores independent of their spectral properties, without requiring additional spectral separation. Brightness Demixing operates within a single detection channel, eliminating the need for additional spectral filters or cameras. We demonstrate this approach with simultaneous two- and three-target imaging in both 2D and 3D configurations. By maintaining single-wavelength excitation and minimizing chromatic aberrations, this method significantly enhances multiplexing in SMLM while remaining fully compatible with existing setups. Brightness Demixing thus offers a simple yet powerful approach for expanding multi-target imaging capabilities in super-resolution microscopy."
"BackgroundNeisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of the sexually transmitted infection, gonorrhoea, is known to form biofilms rich in extracellular DNA on human cervical cells. Biofilm formation is conducive to increased antimicrobial resistance and evasion of the host immune system, potentially causing asymptomatic infections. Using plate-based assays we have previously shown that disruption of a potential extracellular DNA ligase, Lig E, in N. gonorrhoeae (Ngo-Lig E) impacts biofilm formation. In this research, we further explored this phenotype using confocal and scanning electron microscopy to directly visualise the morphology of microcolony and biofilm formation. Biofilm growth on artificial surfaces and on 3-dimensional human vaginal epithelial tissue was evaluated for strains where ngo-lig E was either disrupted or overexpressed.

ResultsResults demonstrated that Ngo-Lig E was important for the formation of robust, compact N. gonorrhoeae microcolonies, as well as extensive biofilms on artificial surfaces. The ngo-lig E deletion strain also had the highest tendency to be retained on the surface of epithelial tissues, with decreased invasion and damage to host cell layers.

ConclusionsThese findings support a role for Ngo-Lig E to be secreted from N. gonorrhoeae cells for the purpose of inter-cell adhesion and biofilm formation. We suggest that Ngo-Lig E strengthens the extracellular matrix and hence microcolony and biofilm formation of N. gonorrhoeae by ligation of extracellular DNA."
"Pancreatic KATP channel trafficking defects underlie congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) cases unresponsive to the KATP channel opener diazoxide, the mainstay medical therapy for CHI. Current clinically used KATP channel inhibitors have been shown to act as pharmacochaperones and restore surface expression of trafficking mutants; however, their therapeutic utility for KATP trafficking impaired CHI is hindered by high-affinity binding, which limits functional recovery of rescued channels. Recent structural studies of KATP channels employing cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) have revealed a promiscuous pocket where several known KATP pharmacochaperones bind. The structural knowledge provides a framework for discovering KATP channel pharmacochaperones with desired reversible inhibitory effects to permit functional recovery of rescued channels. Using an AI-based virtual screening technology AtomNet(R) followed by functional validation, we identified a novel compound, termed Aekatperone, which exhibits chaperoning effects on KATP channel trafficking mutations. Aekatperone reversibly inhibits KATP channel activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) [~] 9 M. Mutant channels rescued to the cell surface by Aekatperone showed functional recovery upon washout of the compound. CryoEM structure of KATP bound to Aekatperone revealed distinct binding features compared to known high affinity inhibitor pharmacochaperones. Our findings unveil a KATP pharmacochaperone enabling functional recovery of rescued channels as a promising therapeutic for CHI caused by KATP trafficking defects."
"Drought response in plants is complex, involving integration across a range of physiological processes. However, our knowledge of how different aspects of drought response are linked at the genetic level is limited. We investigated multi-trait adaptation in Arabidopsis thaliana from the Cape Verde Islands (CVI). Using a high-throughput phenotyping platform that minimizes spatial heterogeneity, we measured variation in rosette area, growth rate, leaf color, water-use efficiency (WUE), and stomatal patterning under precisely controlled water conditions. Relative to the Moroccan outgroup, CVI populations evolved to be smaller rosette size with faster growth and reduced WUE, consistent with drought escape adaptation.

Genome-wide association mapping revealed evidence for pleiotropy involving MPK12 (WUE, rosette area, growth rate, and leaf color), NHL26 (WUE and leaf color), SUVH4 (stomatal patterning, rosette area, and leaf color), and FRI (WUE and leaf color), along with an enrichment of signals in ABA response. This study advances our knowledge of the genetic mechanisms driving plant adaptation to novel precipitation environments. By identifying key genetic components and their contributions to multi-trait adaptation, our findings offer insights into how plants respond to environmental challenges and contribute to predicting plant responses to future climate change."
"CHD3 is a component of the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex. Pathogenic CHD3 variants cause Snijders Blok-Campeau Syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder with variable features including developmental delays, intellectual disability, speech/language difficulties, and craniofacial anomalies. To unveil the role of CHD3 in craniofacial development, we differentiated CHD3-KO induced pluripotent stem cells into cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs). CHD3 expression is low in wild-type iPSCs and neuroectoderm, but upregulated during CNCC specification, where it opens the chromatin at BMP-responsive enhancers, to allow binding of DLX5 and other factors. CHD3 loss leads to repression of BMP target genes and an imbalance between BMP and Wnt signalling, ultimately resulting in aberrant mesodermal fate. Consequently, CNCC specification fails, replaced by early-mesoderm identity, which can be partially rescued by titrating Wnt levels. Our findings highlight a novel role for CHD3 as a pivotal regulator of BMP signalling, essential for proper neural crest specification and craniofacial development."
"Aging, the decline in physiological function over time, is marked by the intracellular accumulation of damaged components. It can be attributed to a trade-off between the investment into organismal maintenance and the production of high-quality offspring, where the parent accumulates damage over time and retains it upon reproduction, while the offspring is rejuvenated. Asymmetric damage partitioning has been observed even in simple unicellular organisms, such as Escherichia coli bacteria, that retain aggregates of misfolded proteins during cell division. However, recent studies presented conflicting evidence on the effect of protein aggregates on fitness, ranging from detrimental effects on cell growth to enhanced stress survival. Here, we show that the decisive factor driving growth decline in E. coli is not the presence of a protein aggregate, but the proportion of the intracellular space occupied by it. By following single-cell E. coli lineages expressing fluorescently labeled DnaK chaperones, we quantified damage accumulation and partitioning across generations in microfluidic devices. Our results suggest that the aggregation of damaged proteins allows cells to keep damage separate from vital processes and compensate for the lost intracellular space by growing to larger sizes. This process results in morphologically asymmetric divisions, a finding that counters the long-assumed symmetry of E. coli cell division. In line with other recent evidence, our findings point to a more complex role of protein aggregation, with implications for our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying aging as well as its evolutionary origins."
"Population genomic analyses rely on an accurate and unbiased characterization of the genetic composition of the studied population. For short-read, high-throughput sequencing data, mapping sequencing reads to a linear reference genome can bias population genetic inference due to mismatches in reads carrying non-reference alleles. In this study, we investigate the impact of mapping bias on allele frequency estimates from pseudohaploid data, commonly used in ultra-low coverage ancient DNA sequencing. To mitigate mapping bias, we propose an empirical adjustment to genotype likelihoods. Using data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we find that our new method improves allele frequency estimation. To test a downstream application, we simulate ancient DNA data with realistic post-mortem damage to compare widely used methods for estimating ancestry proportions under different scenarios, including reference genome selection, population divergence, and sequencing depth. Our findings reveal that mapping bias can lead to differences in estimated admixture proportion of up to 4% depending on the reference population. However, the choice of method has a much stronger impact, with some methods showing differences of 10%. qpAdm appears to perform best at estimating simulated ancestry proportions, but it is sensitive to mapping bias and its applicability may vary across species due to its requirement for additional populations beyond the sources and target population. Our adjusted genotype likelihood approach largely mitigates the effect of mapping bias on genome-wide ancestry estimates from genotype likelihood-based tools. However, it cannot account for the bias introduced by the method itself or the noise in individual site allele frequency estimates due to low sequencing depth. Overall, our study provides valuable insights for obtaining more precise estimates of allele frequencies and ancestry proportions in empirical studies."
"BackgroundThe identification of sites of DNA replication initiation in mammalian cells has been challenging. Here, we present unbiased detection of replication initiation events in human cells using BrdU incorporation and single-molecule nanopore sequencing.

ResultsIncreases in BrdU incorporation allow us to measure DNA replication dynamics, including identification of replication initiation, fork direction and termination on individual nanopore sequencing reads. Importantly, initiation and termination events are identified on single-molecules with high resolution, throughout S-phase, genome-wide and at high coverage at specific loci using targeted enrichment. We find a significant enrichment of initiation sites within the broad initiation zones identified by population level studies. However, these focused initiation sites only account for [~]20% of all identified replication initiation events. Most initiation events are dispersed throughout the genome and are missed by cell population approaches. This indicates that most initiation occurs at sites that, individually, are rarely used. These dispersed initiation sites contrast with the focused sites identified by population studies, in that they do not show a strong relationship to transcription or a particular epigenetic signature.

ConclusionsWe show here that single-molecule sequencing enables unbiased detection and characterisation of DNA replication initiation events, including the numerous dispersed initiation events that replicate most of the human genome."
"Microbial communities play a central role in regulating the greenhouse gas balance in soil ecosystems. Microorganisms are active in the cold, snow-covered Arctic tundra soils; however, their contribution to the greenhouse gas budget during the Arctic winter remains poorly understood. To investigate the functional activity of bacterial and archaeal communities in oroarctic tundra soils during late winter, metatranscriptomic samples were collected alongside greenhouse gas (GHG) flux measurements across key vegetation types, which represent pH and moisture gradients. The transcription of central carbohydrate metabolism genes, various stress-related genes, and high carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes evidenced active microbial metabolism in winter. Vegetation type, soil C/N ratio, pH, and water content explained the functional activity and microbial community composition during winter. The transcription of functional marker genes for methane oxidation and denitrification, coupled with flux data, suggests that shrublands and meadows act as methane (CH4) sinks in winter, while all vegetation types function as small nitrous oxide (N2O) sources. Our results further demonstrate that the soil microbial community has a significant impact on wintertime GHG emissions in the oroarctic tundra, thereby enhancing the explanatory power of a statistical model beyond that of abiotic environmental variables alone. This represents a promising step toward developing microbial-mediated models, which are crucial for improving predictions of ecosystem responses to climate change."
"Uric acid is a key intermediate in purine degradation across diverse organisms, while its accumulation in humans leads to inflammation and gout disease. Aerobic organisms degrade uric acid via a well-known ""oxidative pathway"" involving dearomatization of the purine core catalyzed by uric acid oxidases or dehydrogenases. The ability to degrade uric acid is also widespread in anaerobic bacteria, including gut bacteria, although the mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of a recently identified uric acid degradation gene cluster from Escherichia coli, and show that it encodes a ""reductive pathway"" for uric acid degradation. In this pathway, uric acid is first reduced to isoxanthine (2,8-dioxopurine) by a xanthine dehydrogenase homolog (XdhD), followed by dearomatization of the purine core catalyzed by a flavin-dependent reductase (YgfK). Stepwise cleavage of the pyrimidine and imidazole rings forms 2,3-diureidopropionate, and stepwise cleavage of the 2- and 3-ureido groups then forms 2,3-diaminopropionate, which is cleaved by a pyridoxal 5-phosphate-dependent lyase (YgeX) to pyruvate and ammonia. Detection of isoxanthine in clinical serum samples suggests it is a physiologically relevant circulating metabolite. A probiotic E coli Nissle strain was engineered for constitutive overexpression of the gene cluster, and oral administration in a uricase-knockout hyperuricemic mouse model significantly reduced the serum uric acid level and alleviated associated kidney injury, suggesting a potential route towards uricolytic probiotics."
"Predicting T cell receptor (TCR) activation is challenging due to the lack of both unbiased benchmarking datasets and computational methods that are sensitive to small mutations to a peptide. To address these challenges, we curated a comprehensive database, called BATCAVE, encompassing complete single amino acid mutational assays of more than 22,000 TCR-peptide pairs, centered around 25 immunogenic human and mouse epitopes, across both major histocompatibility complex classes, against 151 TCRs. We then present an interpretable Bayesian model, called BATMAN, that can predict the set of peptides that activates a TCR. We also developed an active learning version of BATMAN, which can efficiently learn the binding profile of a novel TCR by selecting an informative yet small number of peptides to assay. When validated on our database, BATMAN outperforms existing methods and reveals important biochemical predictors of TCR-peptide interactions. Finally, we demonstrate the broad applicability of BATMAN, including for predicting off-target effects for TCR-based therapies and polyclonal T cell responses."
"The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that controls the expression of hundreds of genes. Emerging evidence suggests that the p53-induced RNA-binding protein ZMAT3 is a key splicing regulator that functions in p53-dependent tumor suppression in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism by which ZMAT3 functions in the p53 pathway is largely unclear. Here, we discovered a function of ZMAT3 in inhibiting transcription of HKDC1, a hexokinase that regulates glucose metabolism and mitochondrial respiration. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified HKDC1 as the most significantly upregulated protein in ZMAT3-depleted colorectal cancer cells. ZMAT3 depletion results in increased mitochondrial respiration that was rescued upon depletion of HKDC1, suggesting that HKDC1 is a critical downstream effector of ZMAT3. Unexpectedly, ZMAT3 did not bind to the HKDC1 RNA or DNA but the identification of the ZMAT3-interactome uncovered its interaction with the oncogenic transcription factor JUN. ZMAT3 depletion resulted in increased JUN binding at the HKDC1 promoter and increased HKDC1 transcription that was rescued upon JUN depletion, suggesting that JUN activates HKDC1 transcription in ZMAT3-depleted cells. Collectively, these data reveal a mechanism by which ZMAT3 regulates transcription and demonstrates that HKDC1 is a key component of the ZMAT3-regulated transcriptome in the context of mitochondrial respiration regulation."
"Transcription factors (TFs) mediate gene expression changes during differentiation and development. However, how TF biophysical properties and abundance dynamically regulate specific cell state transitions remains poorly understood.

Using automated live-cell single-molecule tracking (SMT) in intestinal organoid models, we revealed an expression level-independent decrease in the fraction of immobile Sox9 molecules during differentiation from [~]48% to [~]38%, largely dependent on DNA binding. Strikingly, long-term Sox9 overexpression caused organoids to transition from budding to spheroid morphology accompanied by increased proliferation and a loss in gene expression signatures for intestinal identity and function. In this fetal-like reprogrammed state, a larger fraction of partially self- interacting Sox9 molecules ([~]61%) binds to DNA.

Our results suggest context-dependent Sox9 single-molecule dynamics during adult intestinal differentiation and fetal-like reversion in consequence to long-term Sox9 overexpression. Our work underpins the power of our automated live-cell SMT framework to generate testable hypotheses towards unraveling molecular mechanisms underlying tissue-level phenotypes.

Highlights- Heterogenous diffusion behavior of Sox9 across intestinal differentiation states
- Concentration-independent decrease in chromatin-bound Sox9 upon differentiation
- Sox9 overexpression leads to fetal-like reversion and more immobile Sox9 molecules
- Automated SMT in 2D monolayers reveals TF dynamics underlying organoid phenotypes"
"Neural activity in motor cortical areas is well-explained by latent neural population dynamics: the motor preparation phase sets the initial condition for the movement while the dynamics that unfold during the motor execution phase orchestrate the sequence of muscle activations. While preparatory activity explains a large fraction of both neural and behavior variability during the execution of a planned movement, it cannot account for corrections and adjustments during movements as this requires sensory feedback not available during planning. Therefore, accounting for unplanned, sensoryguided movement requires knowledge of relevant inputs to the motor cortex from other brain areas. Here, we provide evidence that these inputs cause transient deviations from an autonomous neural population trajectory, and show that these dynamics cannot be found by unsupervised inference methods. We introduce the new Behavior-Aligned Neural Dynamics (BAND) model, which exploits semi-supervised learning to predict both planned and unplanned movements from neural activity in the motor cortex that can be missed by unsupervised inference methods. Our analysis using BAND suggests that 1) transient motor corrections are encoded in small neural variability; 2) motor corrections are encoded in a sparse sub-population of primary motor cortex neurons (M1); and 3) combining latent dynamical modeling with behavior supervision allows for capturing both the movement plan and corrections.

SummaryMotor cortical neural activity is commonly viewed as a low-dimensional dynamics evolving from the movement preparation state, which explains the most of both neural and behavioral variability. We found that movement corrections to unexpected behavior perturbations do not follow the same pattern, with only a small fraction of neural variability explaining large changes in behavior. We show that capturing both movement planning and corrections requires models that incorporate dynamics and weak behavior supervision. We characterize the bidirectional relationships between motor cortical activity and behavior, identifying neural code for both feedforward and feedback-driven motor control."
"The cornea, situated at the forefront of the eyeball, is often subjected to varying degrees of mechanical laceration injuries due to various traumatic incidents. Timely and precise suturing of corneal wounds to prevent the leakage of intraocular contents is a significant clinical challenge. Although some studies have attempted to use hydrogels to accurately cover corneal injuries, most of these hydrogels are only suitable for adhering to focal stromal defects that do not involve the corneal stroma. Here, a fully protein-based hydrogel, based on SpyTag-SpyCatcher chemistry, was investigated for repairing corneal perforating injury models in rats and rabbits. The hydrogel formation relies on covalent bonding between SpyTag (A) and SpyCatcher (B) under physiologically mild conditions, eliminating requirements for organic solvents, elevated temperatures, or photoactivation Notably, integration of recombinant mussel foot protein 3 (Mfp3) endowed the hydrogels with exceptional water-resistant adhesiveness, while maintaining their original mechanical properties and biocompatibility. This study demonstrates the great potential of Mfp hydrogels in the timely and precise repair of corneal perforating injuries in complex physicochemical environments.

TeaserBioinspired protein hydrogel rapidly seals corneal perforations, minimizing scarring and inflammation without sutures in animal models."
"Spiking activity along synaptic circuits linking primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) areas is fundamental for sensorimotor integration in cortex. Circuits along the ascending somatosensory pathway through mouse hand/forelimb S1 and M1 were recently described in detail (Yamawaki et al., 2021). Here, we characterize the peripherally evoked spiking dynamics in these two cortical areas. Brief (5 ms) optogenetic photostimulation of the hand generated short ([~]25 ms) barrages of activity first in S1 (onset latency 15 ms) then M1 (10 ms later). The estimated propagation speed was 20-fold faster from hand to S1 than from S1 to M1. Amplitudes in M1 were strongly attenuated. Responses were typically triphasic, with suppression and rebound following the initial peak. Evoked activity in S1 was biased to middle layers, consistent with thalamocortical connectivity, while that in M1 was biased to upper layers, consistent with corticocortical connectivity. Parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory interneurons were involved in each phase, accounting for three quarters of the initial spikes generated in S1, and their selective photostimulation sufficed to evoke suppression and rebound in both S1 and M1. Partial silencing of S1 by PV activation during hand stimulation reduced the M1 sensory responses. Overall, these results characterize how evoked spiking activity propagates along the hand/forelimb transcortical loop, and illuminate how in vivo cortical dynamics relate to the underlying synaptic circuit organization in this system."
"Ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs) are largely studied in mice as a marker of social communication. These USVs are usually recorded during short social encounters in unfamiliar test cages. In the present study, we explored how freely interacting pairs of C57BL/6J adult female mice spontaneously use USVs over long-term monitoring. In this situation, we discovered that these mice display a previously undescribed behaviour: they emit specific USV sequences while depositing a large quantity of urine in a corner of the cage. The most striking feature of USVs accompanying this vocalised urination behaviour was the stereotyped duration of the inter-USV intervals. The variability in the frequency of occurrence of this behaviour was important between pairs. Interestingly, when accompanied by the specific USV sequence, urination was correlated with a significant increase in locomotor activity in both the emitter and the cage mate, in contrast with urination without USVs. Altogether, the observation and description of this vocalised urination behaviour argue for exploring mouse vocalisations at the sequence level to understand the USV-behaviours interactions."
"Huntingtons disease (HD) is characterized by neuronal dysfunction and degeneration that varies markedly by brain region and cell type. We previously showed that CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the mHTT gene correlates with increased expression of the mismatch repair genes MSH2 and MSH3 in striatal medium spiny neurons1, and demonstrated that, in the striatum and cerebral cortex of individuals with HD, hundreds of genes are dysregulated in neuronal cell types carrying somatically expanded CAG repeat in mHTT1,2. Here we employ comprehensive epigenetic profiling in specific neuronal and glial cell types from the human striatum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of control and HD donor samples to identify cell type- and species-specific transcriptional control mechanisms in the mismatch repair genes MSH2, MSH3 and FAN1 that can explain the specificity of somatic CAG expansion in the first stage of HD. In the second, toxic phase of HD we identify two distinct epigenetic mechanisms that disrupt regulation of hundreds of genes in the majority of HD MSNs, including several that cause haploinsufficient neurological disorders. Our data support a mechanistic model of HD pathogenesis in which regulation of mismatch repair gene transcription determines the selectivity of somatic expansion, and DNA methylation stabilizes the toxic effect of mutant huntingtin on HD-modifying proteins MED15 and TCERG1, which regulate enhancer function and transcription elongation."
"BackgroundChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies are highly efficacious for several different hematologic cancers. However, for most CAR T targets it is observed that low surface antigen density on tumors can significantly reduce therapeutic efficacy. Here, we explore this dynamic in the context of CD72, a surface antigen we recently found as a promising target for refractory B-cell cancers, but for which CD72 low antigen density can lead to therapeutic resistance in preclinical models.

MethodsPrimary samples were accessed via institutional review board-approved protocols. Affinity-matured and humanized nanobody clones were previously described in Temple et al.1 CAR T-cells were generated via lentiviral transduction. In vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed using luciferase-labeled cell lines. In vivo studies were performed using cell line- or patient-derived xenografts implanted in NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice.

ResultsWe first confirmed ubiquitous CD72 expression across a range of primary B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. We further found that after resistance to CD19-directed therapies, across both B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) models and primary tumor samples, surface CD72 expression was largely preserved while CD22 expression was significantly diminished. Affinity maturation of a nanobody targeting CD72, when incorporated into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, led to more effective elimination in vitro of isogenic models of CD72 low-expressing tumors. These results suggested that nanobody-based CAR T-cells (nanoCARs) may exhibit a similar relationship between binder affinity, antigen expression, and efficacy as previously demonstrated only for scFv-based CAR T-cells. Surprisingly, however, this significantly improved in vitro efficacy only translated to modest in vivo survival benefit. As a parallel strategy to enhance CAR T function, we found that the small molecule bryostatin could also significantly increase CD72 surface antigen density on B-cell malignancy models. Structural modeling and biochemical analysis identified critical residues improving CD72 antigen recognition of our lead affinity-matured nanobody.

ConclusionsTogether, these findings support affinity-matured CD72 nanoCARs as a potential immunotherapy product for CD19-refractory B-cell cancers. Our results also suggest that for B-ALL in particular, CD72 may be a preferable second-line immunotherapy target over CD22.

What is already known on this topicPrevious work using single chain variable fragment (scFv) based CAR Ts has suggested that improving affinity for target antigen could potentially help mitigate tumor resistance mediated by antigen downregulation, or baseline low antigen density. However, it is unknown whether this same dynamic holds for CAR T-cells that utilize different antigen recognition elements, such as nanobodies.

What this study addsHere we show that affinity maturation of nanobody-based CAR T-cells (nanoCARs) targeting CD72 can improve their in vitro efficacy versus CD72-low tumors; however, in vivo efficacy differences are more modest. Furthermore, we show that for refractory B-cell malignancies, surface CD72 appears preserved after CD19 resistance even in situations where CD22 is strongly downregulated.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyCD72 warrants further investigation as a preferred immunotherapy target in the context of CD19-refractory B-cell cancers, though nanobody affinity maturation is not a universal solution to the challenge of low tumor surface antigen density."
"MmpL3 is a promising new target for antitubercular drugs, but the microbiological properties of MmpL3 inhibitors are not fully understood. We compared the activity and mode of action of 11 structurally diverse compound series that target MmpL3. We confirmed activity was via MmpL3 using strains with differential expression of MmpL3. MmpL3 inhibitors had potent activity against replicating M. tuberculosis, with increased activity against intramacrophage bacilli and were rapidly bactericidal. MmpL3 inhibition induced cell wall stress concomitantly with a boost in ATP levels in M. tuberculosis. Mutation in MmpL3 conferred resistance to all series at different levels. Molecules did not negatively impact membrane potential, pH homeostasis or induce reactive oxygen species and were inactive against starved bacilli. Our study revealed common features related to the chemical inhibition of MmpL3, enabling the identification of off-target effects and highlighting the potential of such compounds as future drug candidates."
"In most branches of the fungal kingdom, sexual development marks a dramatic shift from simple multicellular hyphae to complex fruiting bodies composed of multiple tissues and cell types. It is essential to tightly regulate development to prevent unnecessary energy investment into building these structures. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is a highly conserved regulator of development in multicellular organisms. In plants, animals, and some fungi, PRC2 tri-methylates histone H3 lysine 27 in promoters and gene bodies to repress gene expression. In Neurospora crassa, H3K27me3-associated genes are poorly conserved and stably repressed in standard lab conditions. Through analysis of publicly available RNA-seq experiments, we found that PRC2-methylated genes are broadly and uniquely activated during sexual development. PRC2-methylated genes comprise a distinct subset of developmentally induced genes (DIGs) characterized by an exceptionally high degree of cell-type specificity. Loss of PRC2 activity results in the precocious formation of perithecia-like structures (dubbed false perithecia), even in the absence of a compatible mating-type partner. These structures show a unique gene expression profile with activation of both PRC2-methylated and unmethylated DIGs, showing evidence of a transcriptional reprogramming event. Together, these data suggest that PRC2 is part of a developmental checkpoint that restricts fruiting body development to the appropriate conditions."
"Dysfunctions in melanocytes can lead to pigmentation disorders, such as albinism, or contribute to the development of melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Epidermal melanocytes typically interact with the collagen IV-rich basement membrane, but upon injury or in pathological conditions, they can encounter environments rich in collagen I or fibronectin. While alterations in extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and stiffness are known to impact cell behavior, the specific roles of each of these cues for melanocyte functions remain unclear. To explore the impact of these extrinsic cues, we here exposed murine melanocytes to different ECM proteins as well as varying substrate stiffnesses. This study identified MITF, a key regulator of melanocyte differentiation and function, as an ECM- and mechanosensitive transcription factor. We further revealed that distinct ECM proteins and substrate stiffness engage a FAK/MEK/ERK/MITF signaling axis to control melanocyte functions. Exposure of melanocytes to collagen I restricted FAK and ERK activation, promoting high nuclear MITF levels associated with melanocyte proliferation and differentiation. Conversely, fibronectin elicited elevated FAK and ERK activation, leading to low nuclear MITF, correlating with a dedifferentiated and motile phenotype. Consistent with these observations, RNA sequencing revealed that collagen I supports a differentiated gene expression program, whereas fibronectin induces a dedifferentiated transcriptomic signature. Importantly, inhibiting MEK or ERK activity in melanocytes cultured on fibronectin led to increased MITF nuclear localization and enhanced melanogenesis. Additionally, on fibronectin FAK inhibition reduced ERK activation and enhanced melanogenesis, supporting a role for FAK upstream of ERK. Finally, we uncovered that melanocyte mechanoresponses differ depending on the specific ECM environment. Together, these findings reveal a substantial effect of extrinsic cues on melanocyte function, with a context-dependent MITF regulation downstream of ERK, offering new perspectives for our understanding of melanocyte-related pathologies."
"Chromosomal instability (CIN), a characteristic feature of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), drives tumor aggressiveness and therapy resistance, presenting an intractable problem in cancer treatment. CIN leads to constitutive stimulation of the innate immune cGAS-STING pathway, which has been typically linked to anti-tumor immunity. However, despite the high CIN burden in EAC, the cGAS- STING pathway remains largely intact.

To address this paradox, we developed novel esophageal cancer models, including a CIN-isogenic model, discovering myeloid-attracting chemokines - with the chemokine CXCL8 (IL-8) as a prominent hit - as conserved CIN-driven targets in EAC.

Using high-resolution multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy, we quantified the extent of ongoing cGAS-activating CIN in human EAC tumors by measuring cGAS-positive micronuclei in tumor cells, validated by orthogonal whole-genome sequencing-based CIN metrics. By coupling in situ CIN assessment with single-nucleus RNA sequencing and multiplex immunophenotypic profiling, we found tumor cell-intrinsic innate immune activation and intratumoral myeloid cell inflammation as phenotypic consequences of CIN in EAC. Additionally, we identified increased tumor cell-intrinsic CXCL8 expression in CINhigh EAC, accounting for the inflammatory tumor microenvironment.

Using a novel signature of CIN, termed CINMN, which captures ongoing CIN-associated gene expression, we confirm poor patient outcomes in CINhigh tumors with signs of aberrantly rewired cGAS-STING pathway signaling.

Together, our findings help explain the counterintuitive maintenance and expression of cGAS-STING pathway components in aggressive, CINhigh tumors and emphasize the need to understand the contribution of CIN to the shaping of a pro-tumor immune landscape. Therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting the cGAS-driven inflammation axis may be instrumental in improving patient outcomes in this aggressive cancer."
"O_LIChloroplasts act as environmental sensors, enabling rapid plant stress responses through operational retrograde signaling. While these signals operate on minutes-to-hours time scales, their cumulative impact and function across a plants lifecycle and in field conditions remains unknown.
C_LIO_LIWe investigated if retrograde signalings transient changes to gene expression have cumulative effects by generating wheat mutants with primed SAL1-PAP retrograde pathway responsiveness. After confirming changes in photosynthesis and drought resilience under controlled conditions, we conducted 15 field trials across South-Eastern Australia, spanning diverse environments with varying temperatures, rainfall, and light conditions, analysing physiological responses, yield, biomass, and water productivity.
C_LIO_LIWe found gene locus-specific effects on biomass, yield, and water productivity. Multi-environment analysis showed the SAL-4A locus was more strongly associated with improved performance, with the converse for SAL-5D. Significantly, modulation of specific SAL subtypes enhanced photosynthetic efficiency and stress resilience while improving average yields by 4 and 8% respectively for 4A loci across 15 field sites, challenging the traditional yield-resilience trade-off paradigm.
C_LIO_LIThis study reveals retrograde signals operate in field environments, integrating environmental information across a plants lifecycle to improve yield, water productivity and dynamic acclimation to diverse growing seasons, and highlight the importance of multi-environment field validation for crop modifications.

"Gene expression patterns are determined to a large extent by transcription factor binding to non-coding regulatory regions in the genome. However, gene expression cannot yet be systematically predicted from genome sequences, in part because non-functional matches to the sequence patterns (motifs) recognized by transcription factors (TFs) occur frequently throughout the genome. Large-scale functional genomics data for many TFs has enabled characterization of regulatory networks in experimentally accessible cells such as budding yeast. Beyond yeast, fungi are important industrial organisms and pathogens, but large-scale functional data is only sporadically available. Uncharacterized regulatory networks control key pathways and gene expression programs associated with fungal phenotypes. Here we explore a sequence-only approach to inferring regulatory networks by leveraging the 100s of genomes now available for many clades of fungi. We use gene orthology as the learning signal to infer interpretable, TF motif-based representations of non-coding regulatory regions, thus scaling comparative genomics beyond evolutionary comparisons where these regions can be aligned. We show that similarity of promoters in our motif-based representation predicts gene co-expression, and that we can infer known and novel regulatory connections in diverse fungi. Our new predictions include a pathway for recombination in C. albicans and pathways for mating and an RNAi immune response in Neurospora. Taken together, our results indicate that specific hypotheses about transcriptional regulation in fungi can be obtained for many genes from genome sequence analysis alone."
"Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) plaque accumulation, cognitive decline, lipid dysregulation, and neuroinflammation. While mutations in the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and A{beta}42 accumulation contribute to AD, the mechanisms linking A{beta} to lipid metabolism and neuroinflammation remain unclear. Using Drosophila models, we show that AppNLG and A{beta}42 expression causes locomotor deficits, disrupted sleep, memory impairments, lipid accumulation, synaptic loss, and neuroinflammation. Similar lipid and inflammatory changes are observed in the AppNLG-F knock-in mouse model, reinforcing their role in AD pathogenesis. We identify diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (Dgat2), a key lipid metabolism enzyme, as a modulator of AD phenotypes. In Drosophila and mouse AD models, Dgat2 levels and its transcription factors are altered. Dgat2 knockdown in Drosophila reduced lipid accumulation, restored synaptic integrity, improved locomotor and cognitive function, and mitigated neuroinflammation. Additionally, Dgat2 modulation improved sleep and circadian rhythms. In AppNLG-F mice, Dgat2 inhibition decreased neuroinflammation and reduced AD risk gene expression. These findings highlight the intricate link between amyloid pathology, lipid dysregulation, and neuroinflammation, suggesting that targeting Dgat2 may offer a novel therapeutic approach for AD. Conserved lipid homeostasis mechanisms across species provide valuable translational insights."
"BackgroundHepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a significant global health challenge, leading to chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in the clearance of HBV-infected cells, but their efficacy is often compromised during chronic infection. Adaptive NK cells, characterised by NKG2C expression and enhanced functional responses, represent a promising therapeutic avenue for enhancing anti-HBV immunity and responses to HBV-driven cancers.

MethodsWe applied an established protocol, involving K562-HLA-E expressing feeder cells and cytokines (IL-2), for the expansion of adaptive NK cells from cryopreserved T- and B cell depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from donors with chronic HBV infection alone or with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) co-infection. We evaluated the adaptive profile of expanded NK cells, their antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) capacity and functional responses against hepatoma cell lines in the presence or absence of HBV infection.

ResultsExpanded NK cells achieved >97% purity, with the NKG2C positive population exhibiting a mean 100-fold expansion. These cells demonstrated a predominantly adaptive phenotype with high surface expression of NKG2C and cytotoxic potential (Granzyme B). They maintained high levels of CD16 surface expression and upregulated CD2, essential for ADCC. Functionally, expanded adaptive NK cells showed enhanced ADCC capacity and functional responses to K562 targets, naive, HBV integrant-expressing, and de novo infected hepatoma cell lines. TGF-{beta} preconditioning induced tissue-resident features (CD103, CD49a) in expanded adaptive NK cells, while preserving their adaptive phenotype and functionality, enhancing their potential for liver targeted immunotherapy. Further, expanded adaptive NK cells demonstrated minimal reactivity against autologous activated T cells, suggesting limited off-target effects.

ConclusionsOur study demonstrates the first successful expansion of adaptive NK cells with robust functional responses from donors with chronic viral infection. This approach creates opportunities for NK cell-based therapies alone or in combination with monoclonal antibodies contributing to HBV functional cure strategies and the treatment of HBV-driven cancers."
"ObjectivesClostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a well-known healthcare-associated diarrheal disease. Fidaxomicin, a key antibiotic used to treat CDI, targets rpoB. However, some clinical isolates have mutations in rpoB, which reduces their susceptibility to this antibiotic. In this study, the effects of rpoB mutations on the virulence of C. difficile and efficacy of fidaxomicin against CDI were evaluated in vivo.

MethodsAn rpoB mutant strain (C. difficile G1073R-2024) with reduced fidaxomicin susceptibility was generated through spontaneous induction in a murine CDI model from the parental strain C. difficile VPI 10463. The virulence and therapeutic responses of the mutant strain were compared with those of the parental strain using a CDI model, including survival rate, body weight changes, clinical scores, and bacterial loads in feces.

ResultsC. difficile G1073R-2024 had an amino acid alteration in Gln1073Arg and the minimum inhibitory concentration of fidaxomicin was >64 g/mL. In vivo virulence was not significantly different between strains. Fidaxomicin treatment resulted in 100% survival rates and a comparable reduction in the bacterial load for both strains.

ConclusionsFidaxomicin was effective against CDI caused by the rpoB mutant strain. The emergence of such mutations highlights the need for ongoing surveillance of drug resistance trends in clinical settings."
"The natural history and pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, particularly during the autoantibody- positive stages preceding clinical onset, are not well understood, in part, due to limited availability of human pancreatic samples. Here, we studied 88 organ donors, including 28 single autoantibody-positive and 10 multiple autoantibody-positive donors, by imaging mass cytometry. Approximately 10,000 islets and 16 million single-cells were spatially analyzed using 79 antibodies revealing both {beta}-cell states and the islet-immune interface. We identified IAPP loss from {beta}-cells as an indicator of pre-clinical disease. Alterations in Interferon signatures and downregulation across lineage and functional markers, including markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress, were characteristic of recent-onset disease. Further, in single autoantibody- positive donors, we identified pro-inflammatory myeloid cells and PD1+ memory CD4+ T cells, and in multiple autoantibody-positive samples, found islet-specific and exhausted-like ebector CD8+ T cells. Multiple immune cell subtypes were associated with young age, disease severity and insulitis. This dataset is a major step toward creation of a multi-modal type 1 diabetes disease atlas that will be useful for identifying potential drug targets and association of disease features with clinical co-variates and trial outcomes."
"Lassa fever, caused by Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV), is an endemic zoonosis in several West African countries. Human infections primarily result from transmission from rodent hosts, with the primary reservoir species being Mastomys natalensis, a synanthropic rodent. In Sierra Leone, small-mammal communities are structured along land use gradients, and this structure is hypothesized to influence the risk of Lassa fever outbreaks in human populations. However, whether anthropogenic habitats facilitate significant LASV transmission among small mammals is not well understood.

To address this, we conducted rodent sampling over 43,266 trap nights, detecting 684 rodents and shrews in the Lassa fever-endemic Eastern Province of Sierra Leone. We reconstructed small-mammal contact networks to investigate whether contact rates and network structures differed by land use to identify settings more conducive to viral transmission among hosts. We found that small-mammal communities were larger in villages and agricultural settings than in forests, but contact rates were similar across habitats. Network structures differed by land use, with villages exhibiting more disconnected networks compared to agricultural settings. Notably, intra-specific contact among M. natalensis was more likely in agricultural environments than in villages, suggesting that land use can influence LASV transmission dynamics.

Overall, LASV seroprevalence was 5.7% across the small-mammal communities, with LASV antibodies detected in nine rodent and shrew species. These findings underscore the importance of expanding rodent surveillance across various habitats to understand habitat-specific pathogen transmission dynamics. A more systematic approach to LASV surveillance in villages and agricultural settings will help identify key host species driving pathogen dynamics."
"Non-canonical roles for growth factors in the nucleus have been previously described, but their mechanism of action and biological roles remain enigmatic. Platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB) can drive formation of low-grade glioma and here we show that it localizes to the nucleus of human glioma cells where it binds chromatin to preserve genome stability and cell lineage. Failure of PDGFB to localize to the nucleus leads to chromosomal abnormalities, aberrant heterochromatin architecture and accelerated tumorigenesis. Furthermore, nuclear localization of PDGFB is reliant upon the expression levels and mutation status of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). Unexpectedly, we identified macrophages as the predominant source of PDGFB in human, finding that immune-derived PDGFB can localize to the nucleus of glioma cells. Collectively, these studies show that immune derived PDGFB enters the nucleus of glioma cells to maintain genomic stability, while identifying a new mechanism by which IDH mutations promote gliomagenesis."
"Tracking net body movement in real time may enable the brain to estimate ongoing demands and thus better orchestrate muscle tone, energy balance, and arousal. To identify neural populations specializing in tracking net body movement, here we compared self-initiated movement-related activity across genetically-defined subcortical neurons in the mouse brain, including dopaminergic, glutamatergic, noradrenergic, and key peptidergic neurons. We show that hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin-producing neurons (HONs) are exceptionally precise movement-trackers, encoding net body movement across multiple classified behaviors with a high degree of precision, independent of head acceleration. This tracking was so precise, that video analysis of the mouse body movement reliably served as a low-cost biometric for HON population activity. The movement tracking was independent of internal nutritional states, and occurred in a communication bandwidth distinct from HON encoding of blood glucose. At key projection targets, orexin/hypocretin peptide outputs correlated with self-initiated movement in a projection-specific manner, indicating functional heterogeneity in HON outputs. Finally, we found that body movement was not encoded to the same extent in other key neural populations related to arousal or energy. These findings indicate that subcortical orchestrators of arousal and metabolism are finely tuned to encode net body movement, constituting a bridge multiplexing ongoing motor activity with internal energy resources."
"Nodal and Wnt signalling play an important role in the emergence of the mammalian body plan, primarily by orchestrating gastrulation. While the literature suggests they cooperate to build the primitive streak, their individual contributions remain poorly understood. Using gastruloids, we found that Wnt/{beta}-catenin drives a genetic program characteristic of the late primitive streak, promoting the development of posterior body structures in a time and dose-dependent manner. Conversely, Nodal activates a distinct transcriptional module resembling the early streak. By engineering gastruloids with varying levels of Nodal signalling, we demonstrate that a decreasing temporal gradient of Nodal activity is critical for establishing the anterior body, with higher Nodal levels producing more anterior structures in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that Nodal and Wnt act antagonistically, initiating distinct developmental modules within the primitive streak. This antagonism is likely the core mechanism driving the early body plan in mammals."
"Intraocular pressure (IOP), a key factor in glaucoma development, is regulated by aqueous humor (AH) dynamics, with inflow from the ciliary body and outflow through the trabecular meshwork (TM). IOP has a circadian rhythm entrained by sympathetic norepinephrine (NE) from the superior cervical ganglion. Herein, we investigated its underlying regulatory mechanisms in the TM. Through comprehensive gene expression analysis of human TM cells and mouse eyes, we identified 18 genes upregulated by NE stimulation, including the small GTPase RAS homologous protein B (RHOB). Promoter assays revealed RHOB upregulation via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element on its promotor. NE stimulation for 6-9 h increased RHOB level and cellular adhesion, and suppressed liquid permeability in the TM cells, indicating a time-dependent effect. RHOB deficiency increased TM macrophage phagocytosis and eliminated NE-induced suppression of phagocytosis and permeability, whereas RHOB overexpression had the opposite effect. Instillations of RHO or RHO-kinase inhibitors to mice eye reduced nocturnal and NE-induced IOP elevation. Our findings suggest that NE can elevate IOP via RHOB-mediated inhibition of TM phagocytosis, positioning RHOB as a potential glaucoma treatment target and IOP rhythm regulator."
"Esophageal cancer is a major cause of cancer-related death, often preceded with chronic inflammation and injuries. The NF{kappa}B/IKK{beta} pathway plays a central role in inflammation, yet its role in early esophageal carcinogenesis remains unclear. This study investigated the role of epithelial IKK{beta} in early esophageal carcinogenesis. Mice were treated with the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) or a vehicle for one month to induce precancerous lesions. Esophagi were harvested and examined through histological, protein, flow cytometry, and RNA analyses. Histological analysis revealed that 4-NQO treatment led to increased inflammation, intraepithelial CD45+ immune cells, and elevated IKK{beta} phosphorylation levels. Mice with esophageal epithelial-specific Ikk{beta} deletion (4-NQO/Ikk{beta}EEC-KO) showed delayed progression to a precancerous state, with reduced immune cell recruitment compared to 4-NQO/controls. Immunophenotyping showed decreased recruitment of T cells, including CD4+, CD8+ and regulatory (Tregs) T cells, and increased recruitment of macrophages in 4-NQO/Ikk{beta}EEC-KO mice compared to 4-NQO/controls. RNA sequencing data identified 262 differentially expressed genes in 4-NQO/Ikk{beta}EEC-KO mice, implicating pathways related to inflammation and wound healing. Notably, the chemokine CXCL9, a T cell chemoattractant, was significantly upregulated in 4-NQO control mice, but not in 4-NQO/Ikk{beta}EEC-KO mice. Further analysis identified IFN{gamma} as an upstream regulator of Cxcl9 expression, and neutralization of IFN{gamma} reduced Cxcl9 expression levels in 4-NQO treated mice. Additionally, in vitro studies demonstrated that IFN{gamma} upregulates Cxcl9 in an NF-B dependent manner in esophageal keratinocytes. These findings suggest that epithelial IKK{beta} regulates the immune microenvironment in early esophageal carcinogenesis through the IFN{gamma}/CXCL9 axis and influencing T cell recruitment and inflammatory responses.

SummaryIn a mouse model of early esophageal squamous cell carcinogenesis, loss of epithelial Ikk{beta} reduced inflammation and T cell recruitment, increased macrophage recruitment, inhibited IFN{gamma}/CXCL9 signaling, and delayed the transition to a precancerous state."
"Protein biosynthesis must be highly regulated to ensure proper spatiotemporal gene expression and thus cellular viability. Translation is often modulated at the initiation stage by RNA binding proteins through either promotion or repression of ribosome recruitment to the mRNA. However, it largely remains unknown how the kinetics of mRNA ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) assembly on untranslated regions (UTRs) relates to its translation regulation activity. Using Sex-lethal (Sxl)-mediated translation repression of msl-2 in female fly dosage compensation as a model system, we show that different mechanisms in mRNP assembly synergistically achieve tight translation repression. Using multi-color single-molecule fluorescence microscopy we show that 1) Sxl targets its binding sites via sliding and double-binding, 2) that Unr recruitment is accelerated over 500-fold by RNA-bound Sxl and 3) that Hrp48 further stabilizes RNA-bound Sxl indirectly via ATP-independent RNA remodeling. Overall, we provide a framework to study how multiple RBPs dynamically cooperate with RNA to achieve function."
"PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs), also known as Ligand-Directed Degraders (LDDs), are an innovative class of small molecules that leverage the ubiquitin-proteasome system to induce the degradation of target proteins. Structure based design methods are not readily applicable for designing LDDs due to the dynamic nature of the ternary complexes. This study investigates the dynamic properties of five LDD-mediated BRD4-Cereblon complexes, focusing on the challenges of evaluating linker efficiency due to the difficulty in identifying suitable computational metrics that correlate well with the cooperativity or degradation propensity of LDDs. We uncovered that protein frustration, a concept originally developed to understand protein folding, calculated for the residues in the protein-protein interface of the LDD-mediated ternary complexes recapitulate the strength of degradation of the LDDs. Our findings indicated that hydrophobic residues in the interface are among the highly frustrated residues pairs, and they are crucial in distinguishing strong degraders from weak ones. By analyzing frustration patterns, we identified key residues and interactions critical to the effectiveness of the ternary complex. These insights provide practical guidelines for designing and prioritizing more efficient degraders, paving the way for the development of next-generation LDDs with improved therapeutic potential."
"Whole-genome duplication (WGD) events are common across various organisms however the retention and evolution of WGD paralogs is not fully understood. Quantitative measure of protein redistribution in response to the deletion of their WGD paralog provides insight into sources of gene retention. Here, we describe PARPAL (PARalog Protein Retribution using Abundance and Localization in Yeast), a web database that houses results of high-content screening and deep learning neural network analysis of the redistribution of 164 proteins reflecting how their subcellular localization and protein abundance change in response to their paralog deletion. We interrogated a total of 82 paralog pairs in two genetic backgrounds for a total of [~]3,500 micrographs of [~]460,000 cells. PARPAL also links to other studies on trigenic interactions, protein-protein interactions and protein abundance. PARPAL is available at https://parpal.c3g-app.sd4h.ca and is a valuable resource for the yeast community interested in understanding the retention and evolution of paralogs and can help researchers to investigate protein dynamics of paralogs in other organisms."
"The maternal-effect mutation ichabod (ich) results in ventralized zebrafish embryos due to impaired induction of the dorsal canonical Wnt-signaling pathway. While previous studies linked the phenotype to reduced ctnnb2 transcript levels, the causative mutation remained unidentified. Using long-read sequencing, we discovered that the ich phenotype stems from the insertion of a non-autonomous CMC-Enhancer/Suppressor-mutator (CMC-EnSpm) transposon in the 3UTR of the gene. Through reporter assays, we demonstrate that while wild type ctnnb2 mRNAs exhibit remarkably high stability throughout the early stages of development, the insertion of the transposon dramatically reduces transcript stability. Genome-wide mapping of the CMC-EnSpm transposons across multiple zebrafish strains also indicated ongoing transposition activity in the zebrafish genome. Our findings not only resolve the molecular basis of the ich mutation but also highlight the continuing mutagenic potential of endogenous transposons and reveal unexpected aspects of maternal transcript regulation during early zebrafish development."
"Animals rely on physiological and behavioral processes to maintain thermal balance. Some animals, however, bear structures that help dissipate excess heat when body temperatures rise. Although widespread in animals, animal weapons--exaggerated morphological structures with multiple characteristics that can make them good at dissipating heat--have rarely been studied in the context of thermoregulation. Here, we investigated whether the horns of the Rhinoceros Beetle (Megasoma gyas) acted as a thermal window. We heated live and dead beetles to 30{o}C and allowed them to cool to 20{o}C while measuring surface temperature changes in four body regions: the cephalic and thoracic horns, the scutellum, and the abdomen. If horns actively dissipated heat, they would show the lowest cooling rate among body regions. Contrary to this expectation, we found that the cephalic horn had the highest cooling rate, followed by the abdomen, thoracic horn, and scutellum, respectively. This suggests that the horns are not used for active heat dissipation in M. gyas. The low cooling rate of the scutellum can be explained by the presence of large flight muscles in the thorax, which play a role in heat generation, but could also aid in heat dissipation by pumping hemolymph across tagmata or through the low-insulated cuticle to prevent thoracic overheating. We also demonstrate that beetles show regional heterothermy even in the absence of exercise or stress. As such, we propose that regional heterothermy may result from both active (control of hemolymph flow) and passive (heat dissipation through poorly insulated structures) processes within individuals."
"The CA3 region of the hippocampus is the major site of sharp wave initiation, and a brain region crucially involved in learning and memory. Highly recurrent connectivity within its excitatory network is thought to underlie processes involved in memory formation. Recent work has indicated that distinct subpopulations of pyramidal neurons within this region may contribute differently to network activity, including sharp waves, in CA3. Exactly how these contributions may arise is not yet known. Here, we disentangle the local connectivity between two distinct CA3 cell types: thorny and athorny pyramidal cells. We find an asymmetry in the connectivity between these two populations, with athorny cells receiving strong input from both athorny and thorny cells. Conversely, the thorny cell population receives very little input from the athorny population. Computational modeling suggests that this connectivity scheme may determine the sequential activation of these cell types during large network events such as sharp waves."
"Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection with trypanosome parasites (Trypanosoma spp.). These are transmitted by infected tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) and cause a similar disease in animals, known as African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT). AAT is one of the largest constraints to livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa and causes a financial burden of approximately $4.5 billion annually. Some African Bos taurus cattle populations have an important evolutionary adaptation known as trypanotolerance, a genetically determined tolerance of infection by trypanosome parasites (Trypanosoma spp.). Trypanotolerant African B. taurus NDama and trypanosusceptible Bos indicus Boran cattle responded in largely similar ways during trypanosome infection when gene expression was examined using blood, liver, lymph node, and spleen samples with peaks and troughs of gene expression differences following the cyclic pattern of parasitaemia exhibited during trypanosome infection. However, differences in response to infection between the two breeds were reflected in differential expression of genes related to the immune system such as those encoding antimicrobial peptides and cytokines, including, for example, the antimicrobial peptide encoding genes LEAP2, CATHL3, DEFB4A, and S100A7 and the cytokine genes CCL20, CXCL11, CXCL13, CXCL16, CXCL17, IL33, and TNFSF13B. In addition, transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood identified expression differences in genes relating to coagulation and iron homeostasis, which supports the hypothesis that the dual control of parasitaemia and the anaemia resulting from the innate immune response to trypanosome parasites is key to trypanotolerance and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.

Author SummaryTrypanosome parasites are transmitted by infected tsetse flies and cause the neglected tropical disease human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and the similar African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT), which is one of the largest impediments to livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa. Taurine (Bos taurus) and indicine (Bos indicus) cattle shared a common ancestor more than 150,000 years ago, and in the intervening period significant genomic differences have evolved between the two groups. Importantly, several African B. taurus populations have evolved an adaptation known as trypanotolerance, a genetically determined tolerance of infection by trypanosome parasites. Trypanotolerant African taurine and trypanosusceptible indicine cattle responded in largely similar ways during trypanosome infection when gene expression was examined using blood, liver, lymph node, and spleen samples with peaks and troughs of gene expression differences following the cyclic pattern of the number of trypanosome parasites in the blood. Transcriptional profiling of these tissues highlighted genes related to the multiple facets of the immune system; notably, for peripheral blood, differences observed for genes relating to coagulation and iron homeostasis support the existing hypothesis that control of both parasite number and anaemia is an important feature of the trypanotolerance trait and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon."
"Cell type-specific regulatory programs that drive type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the pancreas are poorly understood. Here we performed single nucleus multiomics and spatial transcriptomics in up to 32 non-diabetic (ND), autoantibody-positive (AAB+), and T1D pancreas donors. Genomic profiles from 853,005 cells mapped to 12 pancreatic cell types, including multiple exocrine sub- types. Beta, acinar, and other cell types, and related cellular niches, had altered abundance and gene activity in T1D progression, including distinct pathways altered in AAB+ compared to T1D. We identified epigenomic drivers of gene activity in T1D and AAB+ which, combined with genetic association, revealed causal pathways of T1D risk including antigen presentation in beta cells. Finally, single cell and spatial profiles together revealed widespread changes in cell-cell signaling in T1D including signals affecting beta cell regulation. Overall, these results revealed drivers of T1D progression in the pancreas, which form the basis for therapeutic targets for disease prevention."
"The rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus has created an urgent need for new antibiotics. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise in drug discovery, but existing models often fail to propose compounds that are both effective and synthetically tractable. To address these challenges, we introduce SyntheMol-RL, a reinforcement learning-based generative model that can rapidly design synthetically accessible small molecule drug candidates from a massive chemical space of 46 billion compounds. SyntheMol-RL improves upon our prior Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based SyntheMol model by generalizing across chemically similar building blocks and enabling multi-parameter optimization. We applied SyntheMol-RL to generate candidate antibiotics against S. aureus by optimizing for both antibacterial activity and aqueous solubility, and we found that SyntheMol-RL generated molecules with improved predicted properties compared to both the previous MCTS version of SyntheMol as well as an AI-based virtual screening baseline. We synthesized 79 SyntheMol-RL compounds that were unique relative to the training dataset and found that 13 showed potent in vitro activity, of which seven were structurally novel after detailed literature searches. Furthermore, one hit compound, synthecin, demonstrated efficacy in a murine wound infection model of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). These results validate SyntheMol-RLs ability to generate novel and synthetically accessible candidate antibiotics and position SyntheMol-RL as a powerful tool for drug design across therapeutic domains."
"HNRNPU is an RNA-binding protein with diverse roles in regulating gene expression. Pathogenic genetic variants of HNRNPU cause a severe neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD), but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and RNA targets of HNRNPU in neuroepithelial stem cells (NES) and differentiating neural cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Using high-throughput approaches, we found HNRNPU interacting with the mammalian SWI/SNF complex and highlight its putative role in multiple stages of mRNA regulation. Notably, both PPI partners and interacting mRNAs implicated HNRNPU in translation, a role that had not been recognized before. Also, we found that HNRNPU associated with mRNAs encoding proteins important for neuronal development. Based on our findings, we propose a regulatory model in which HNRNPU, in coordination with SWI/SNF, modulates the levels and accessibility of DNA methylation factors, leading to global methylation differences in HNRNPU deficiency states, as we validated in our cell model. This mechanism provides a molecular link to the distinct methylation signature seen in individuals with HNRNPU-related NDDs as well as to crucial epigenetic regulation during early brain development."
"Working memory (WM) enables temporary retention of task-relevant information for imminent use. Increases in visual WM load are accompanied by elevated contralateral delay activity (CDA), and EEG alpha-band power. While most WM research focuses on the visual domain, it remains unknown whether similar EEG responses also reflect WM load in the auditory domain. Using EEG, we set out to establish such neuro-markers of auditory WM load. Participants memorized the pitches of 1 to 4 pure tones presented to one ear, with 1 to 4 consistent distractor tones presented to the other ear. Behaviorally, auditory WM capacity plateaued between set-sizes two and three. Unlike for visual WM, auditory WM load was not reflected in lateralized EEG responses. This shows that the CDA is a vision-specific rather than domain-general neuro-marker of WM load. Applying multivariate pattern analyses on the delay activity revealed that auditory WM load is reflected in (mostly temporal) patterns of alpha-band oscillations. Surprisingly, a temporal generalization analysis revealed that the alpha patterns reflecting specific load conditions changed throughout the maintenance period (despite load being inherently constant), revealing dynamic coding of auditory WM load."
"The fat-tailed dunnart, Sminthopsis crassicaudata, is a mouse-sized, polyovular, solitary dasyurid marsupial found in central and southern Australia. With the establishment of a chromosome-scale genome assembly, induced pluripotent stem cells, and targeted genetic editing, the dunnart is emerging as the laboratory marsupial model for comparative developmental, reproductive and conservation biology. The development of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are critical to achieving these goals in this species. ART requires a large number of mature oocytes which are typically collected through stimulated and synchronised female reproductive cycles. While protocols for induced-ovulation or superovulation are standard in many placental mammals, there are no methods to date designed for marsupials. In the present study, prepubertal dunnarts were stimulated with pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin and human chronic gonadotrophin across 6 different treatment regimens. Our best regimen resulted in over 70% of prepubertal dunnarts ovulating with 82% normal oocytes. When the primed females were mated with stud males, 4-cell stage embryos were collected 48 h post-hCG administration. At around 96 h post-hCG, 50% (n=8) and 78% (n=9) of the embryos developed to blastocysts. Our results demonstrated successful stimulation of ovulation and mature oocyte collection in prepubertal dunnarts. Furthermore, we confirmed developmental competence of the induced ovulated oocytes through to at least the blastocyst stage. These findings represent the first robust hormonal regimen for predictable oocyte generation in any marsupial and will significantly contribute to the use of the dunnart in developmental and conservation biology."
"Microalgae is currently gaining attention as an alternative source for food production. The market is currently demanding colorless algae with high protein and lutein content as an alternative to currently available commodities. This research was aimed at performing random UV mutagenesis on Chlorella vulgaris to obtain mutants with enhanced growth rates and increased growth characteristics. A total of seven mutants were selected to be analyzed after the random mutagenesis. Small (40 mL) and larger-scale (1,000 mL) reactors were used to analyze the production of C. vulgaris mutant biomass, focusing on the dry matter, starch, chlorophyll, protein, fatty acids, and lutein contents. Results implied that mutants showed a higher specific growth rate (2.1-2.5-fold higher) as compared to the wild type. The three mutants (MT 1, 2, and 3) that exhibited a yellow color were subsequently chosen for further scalability. In larger-scale reactors, all mutants exhibited higher protein contents while displaying lower carbohydrate and chlorophyll contents in comparison to the wild type. Moreover, MT 1 exhibited the highest concentration of lutein (0.37%-0.38%) and the lowest concentration of chlorophyll (0.1-0.14%), both of which are of significance for potential applications in the food industry."
"Many applications of engineered cells are enabled by genetic circuits - networks of genes regulating each other to process stimuli. Complex circuits are built by combining stan-dardised modular components with different functions. Nonetheless, genes within a cell compete for the same limited pool of cellular resources, causing unintended interactions that violate modularity. Circuit components therefore behave differently when combined versus when observed in isolation, which can compromise a biotechnologys predictability and reliability. To forecast steady-state interactions between modules, experimental protocols for characterising their resource competition properties have been proposed. However, they rely on open-loop batch culture techniques in which dynamic control signals cannot be applied to cells. Consequently, these experimental methods have limited predictive power since they may fail to capture all possible steady states, such as repelling equilibria that would not be approached by an unsteered system. In contrast, we present the blueprint for a novel, comprehensive protocol for characterising the resource-dependence of genetic modules performance. Based on the control-based continuation technique, it captures both stable and unstable steady states by applying stabilising cybergenetic feedback with an automated cell culturing platform. Using a range of models with different degrees of complexity, we simulate applying our pipeline to a self-activating genetic switch. This case study illustrates how informative characterisation of a genetic module with automatic feedback control can enable reliable forecasting of its performance when combined with any other circuit component. Hence, our protocol promises to restore predictability to the design of genetic circuits from standardised components."
"Protamine, an arginine-rich protein, compacts DNA more tightly than histones in somatic cells, yet its sequence-specific binding remains unclear. Using all-atom MD simulations with an arginine-rich short cationic peptide that mimics the protamine characteristics, we discovered distinct sequence preferences: the peptide binds preferentially to GC-rich sequences in the major groove and AT-rich sequences in the minor groove. Our structural analysis reveals that GC-rich binding induces significant DNA bending, narrowing the major groove and enhancing peptide interactions. In contrast, AT-rich minor grooves are more extended and electronegative, allowing better stereochemical fitting with planar and aromatic guanidinium side groups of arginine. However, thymines methyl group hinders major groove binding, favoring guanine. Thermodynamic free energy calculations, including MMGBSA, Jarzynskis Equality, and Umbrella Sampling, confirm stronger peptide affinity for AT-rich motifs in the minor groove and GC-rich motifs in the major groove. Overall, this study will contribute to enhancing our understanding of DNA condensation and compaction in sperm cells based on protamines sequence-specific interactions."
"Performing assays on large numbers of samples requires their analysis in distinct batches, which commonly affects the measurements made in a systematic way. Analytical approaches can correct for such batch effects, however for this to be possible the batch should not be confounded with either the independent variable or any covariates relevant to the analysis. Thus, how samples are distributed across batches influences subsequent analytic conclusions. We present SampleAllocateR, an open source tool that employs optimisation methods from machine learning to optimally allocate a preselected set of samples to experimental batches in a way that statistically balances specified covariates between batches. This results in better statistical estimates of the effect of not only the technical batch effects but also the other specified covariates upon the results of the experiment."
"RND efflux pumps are a major cause of multidrug resistance in bacteria, particularly in Gram-negative bacteria. They are complex molecular machines forming tripartite assemblies that actively pump out a wide range of antimicrobial agents, including antibiotics, biocides and host defence molecules. However, the presence of multiple RND pumps with overlapping functions in a single bacterium raises questions about their individual functional relevance.

In this study, we determined the Cryo-EM structures of two distinct HAE-RND pumps from E.coli., MdtB and MdtF. MdtF is a unique class of RND pump whose expression is regulated by oxygen availability and is crucial for the survival of E.coli in anaerobic growth conditions. Surprisingly, homotrimeric MdtB, previously reported to be inactive, exhibited activity in our experiments. Cryo-EM structure determination of MdtF at 2.8 [A] resolution revealed the flexible transmembrane domain with significant conformational changes in the core helixes, leading to the closure of the central pore. While the MdtB structure adopts a resting state, MdtF displays structural dynamics in the presence of DDM. The apo structures of both pumps unveil novel conformational states of HAE-RND efflux transporters. Our findings highlight significant structural and functional divergence among closely related HAE-RND proteins. Despite 71% sequence similarity and phylogenetic proximity to AcrB, the structure of MdtF differs from the solved AcrB structures. In contrast, the MdtB structure exhibits greater resemblance to AcrB, regardless of 32% sequence similarity. Furthermore, our structural analysis provides insights into drug-binding sites and the transport mechanism of these important transporters."
"Multiple brain regions need to coordinate activity to support cognitive flexibility and behavioral adaptation. Neural activity in both the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to represent spatial context and is sensitive to reward and rule alterations. Midbrain dopamine (DA) activity is key in reward seeking behavior and learning. There is abundant evidence that midbrain DA modulates HPC and PFC activity. However, it remains underexplored how these networks engage dynamically and coordinate temporally when animals must adjust their behavior according to changing reward contingencies. In particular, is there any relationship between DA reward prediction change during rule switching, and rule representation changes in PFC and CA1? We addressed these questions using simultaneous recording of neuronal population activity from the hippocampal area CA1, PFC and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in male TH-Cre rats performing two spatial working memory tasks with frequent rule switches in blocks of trials. CA1 and PFC ensembles showed rule-specific activity both during maze running and at reward locations, with PFC rule coding more consistent across animals compared to CA1. Optogenetically tagged VTA DA neuron firing activity responded to and predicted reward outcome. We found that the correct prediction in DA emerged gradually over trials after rule-switching in coordination with transitions in PFC and CA1 ensemble representations of the current rule after a rule switch, followed by behavioral adaptation to the correct rule sequence. Therefore, our study demonstrates a crucial temporal coordination between the rule representation in PFC/CA1, the dopamine reward signal and behavioral strategy.

Significance StatementThis study examines neural activity in mammalian brain networks that support the ability to respond flexibly to changing contexts. We use a rule-switching spatial task to examine whether the key reward-responsive and predictive dopamine (DA) activity changes in coordination with changes in rule representations in key cognitive regions, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. We first established distinct rule representations in PFC and hippocampus, and predictive coding of reward outcomes by DA neuronal activity. We show that the rule-specific DA reward prediction after a rule switch develops in temporal coordination with changes in rule representations in PFC, eventually leading to behavioral changes. These results thus provide an integrated understanding of reward prediction, cognitive representations of rules and behavioral adaptation."
"Debilitating pain is the primary clinical feature of osteoarthritis (OA) that drives the enormous healthcare costs. Osteoarthritis-related pain is often treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which effectively relieve pain and inflammation by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Antibodies directed against nerve growth factor (NGF) were tested some time ago as an alternative potential analgesic for musculoskeletal pain, including osteoarthritis-related pain. Unfortunately, clinical development of these drugs was put on hold due to adverse outcomes - primarily rapidly progressive osteoarthritis. Both prostaglandin synthesis and NGF have been implicated as critical mediators of strain adaptive bone remodeling, which may play a role in rapid osteoarthritis progression. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the effects of celecoxib, an NSAID, and muMab911, an anti-NGF antibody, as well as the combination therapy on strain adaptive bone remodeling, bone mass and geometry, and bone healing in a murine model. Adult female C57BL/6J mice received celecoxib through drinking water, up to 3 IP injections of muMab911, or both treatments over a period of two weeks. As expected, all treatments were effective for relieving injury-associated pain. Consistent with previous studies, we found that celecoxib alone and in combination with muMab911 impaired periosteal load-induced bone formation induced by axial forelimb compression. Furthermore, both treatments had minimal effects on osteoblast and osteocyte populations, bone structural and material properties, and cortical and trabecular bone mass. Mice subjected to damaging axial forelimb compression did not have impaired healing or callus morphology due to treatment. Nonetheless, both drugs decreased NGF expression during fracture healing. In total, our results indicate that these medications both suppress NGF expression and load-induced bone formation which may support rapid OA disease progression by diminishing strain adaptive bone remodeling in subchondral bone of OA patients."
"OpenComplex1 is an open-source platform for comprehending and developing biomolecular models. Based on the architectures of AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-Multimer, the current version of OpenComplex realizes end-to-end predictions of the biomolecular three-dimensional (3D) structures including protein, RNA, and protein-RNA complexes. OpenComplex makes it able to infer and train models of biomolecular complexes in a unified framework and supports encoders that use both MSAs and protein language models (pLM). Through extensive training on both structure and sequence databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and RNA families (Rfam) database, OpenComplex is able to generate models with equivalent or better accuracy for a wide range of biomolecules including monomers or multimers of protein and RNA as well as protein-RNA complexes. In summary, OpenComplex is a powerful tool for predicting accurate biomolecular structures in diverse application scenarios."
"Infertility affects up to 12% of couples globally, with genetic factors contributing to nearly half of the cases. Advances in genomic technologies have led to the discovery of genes like Bend2, which plays a crucial role in gametogenesis. In the testis, Bend2 expresses two protein isoforms: full-length and a smaller one. Ablation of both proteins results in an arrested spermatogenesis. Because the Bend2 locus is on the X chromosome, and the Bend2-/y mutants are sterile, BEND2s role in oogenesis remained elusive.

In this study, we employed a novel Bend2 mutation that blocks the expression of the full-length BEND2 protein but allows the expression of the smaller BEND2 isoform. Interestingly, this mutation does not confer male sterility and mildly affects spermatogenesis. Thus, it allowed us to study the role of BEND2 in oogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that full-length BEND2 is dispensable for male fertility, and its ablation leads to a reduced establishment of the ovarian reserve. These results reveal a critical role for full-length BEND2 in oogenesis and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the establishment of the ovarian reserve. Furthermore, these findings hold relevance for the diagnostic landscape of human infertility."
"Cell migration is a complex process hallmarked by front-to-back cell polarity that is established by the highly dynamic actin cytoskeleton. Branched actin polymerization creates a lamellipodia at the leading edge of the cell, while the contractile acto-myosin cytoskeleton is present at the lagging edge. Rap2, a Ras GTPase family member, has previously been reported to localize to the lamellipodia as a result of Rab40/CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase induced tri-mono-ubiquitylation. However, how Rap2 functions and how mono-ubiquitylation targets Rap2 to the lamellipodia remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Rap2 is recruited to retracting lamellipodia ruffles where it inhibits RhoA and regulates lamellipodia dynamics and facilitates cell migration. Furthermore, using a variety of genetic and pharmacological techniques, we show that tri-mono-ubiquitylation is required for GEF-dependent Rap2 activation, a necessary step for Rap2 targeting to lamellipodia membrane. As such, we demonstrate how this unique mono-ubiquitylation of Rap2 regulates lamellipodia actin dynamics during cell migration.

SUMMARYMono-ubiquitylation is necessary for activity and localization of the Rap2 GTPase. Here, we report that Rap2 lamellipodia and membrane dwell time is facilitated by mono-ubiquitylation dependent GEF activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mono-ubiquitylated Rap2 regulates lamellipodia dynamics through inhibiting RhoA activity."
"MINFLUX is a super-resolution microscopy technique with remarkable resolution for imaging and tracking. Its optical resolution is well understood under idealized conditions, but because of system complexity and experimental imperfections, actual performance can be much worse.

Here we present SimuFLUX, a comprehensive and realistic simulator for MINFLUX. We use it to investigate performance limits caused by fluorophore dynamics, background, estimators, and misalignment, and to simulate experiments to optimize parameters and assess feasibility."
"PurposeThe miR-183/96/182 cluster (miR-183C) is required for normal functions of sensory neurons (SN) and various immune cells, including myeloid cells (MC). This research aims to reveal the roles of miR-183C of SN in the interplay of corneal sensory nerves (CSN) and MC during Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) keratitis.

MethodsDouble-tracing mice with SN-specific (SNS) conditional knockout of miR-183C (CKO) and age-and sex-matched wild type (WT) controls were used. Their CSN are labeled with Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP); MC with Enhanced Green (EG)FP. The left corneas were scarified and infected with ATCC19660 PA. Corneal flatmounts were prepared at 3, 6, and 12 hours post-infection (hpi) and 1, 3, and 5 days (d)pi for confocal microscopy. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay and plate count were performed at 1 dpi.

ResultsIn WT mice, CSN began to degenerate as early as 3 hpi, starting from the fine terminal CSN in the epithelial/subepithelial layers, most prominently in the central region. By 1 dpi, CSN in the epithelium/subepithelial layer were nearly completely destroyed, while stromal nerves persisted. From 3 dpi, CSN were obliterated in both layers. In CKO vs WT mice, CNS followed a slightly slower pace of degeneration. CSN density was decreased at 3 and 6 hpi. However, at 3 dpi, residual large-diameter stromal CSN were better preserved. MC were decreased in the central cornea at 3 and 6 hpi, but increased in the periphery. Both changes were more prominent in CKO vs WT mice. At 12 hpi, densely packed MC formed a ring-shaped band circling a ""dark"" zone nearly devoid of MC, colocalizing with CSN most degenerated zone in the central cornea. In CKO vs WT, the ring center was larger with fewer MC. At 1 dpi, the entire cornea was filled with MC; however, MC density was lower in CKO mice. An MPO assay showed decreased neutrophils in PA-infected cornea of CKO mice. This led to a decreased severity of PA keratitis at 3 dpi.

ConclusionsThis double-tracing model reveals the interplay between CSN and MC during PA keratitis with greater clarity, providing new insights into PA keratitis. CSN-imposed modulation on innate immunity is most impressive within 24 hours after infection. Functionally, the miR-183C in CSN modulates CSN density and the dynamics of MC fluxes-a neuroimmune interaction in display."
"Neuronal coding and decoding would be compromised if neuronal responses were highly variable. Intriguingly, neuronal spike counts (SCs) show a reduction in across-trial variance (ATV) in response to sensory stimulation, when SC variance is normalized by SC mean, that is, when using the Fano factor 1. Inspired by this seminal finding, ATV has also been studied in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, revealing effects of various stimulus and cognitive factors as well as disease states. Here, we empirically show that outside of evoked potentials, the ATV of the EEG or local field potential (LFP) is very highly correlated to the intra-trial variance (ITV), which corresponds to the well-known power metric. We propose that the LFP power, rather than the raw LFP signal, should be considered with regard to putative changes of its variability. We quantify LFP power variability as the standard deviation of the logarithm of the power ratio between an active and a baseline condition, normalized by the mean of that log(power ratio), that is the coefficient of variation (CV) of the log(power ratio). This CV(log(power ratio)) is reduced for gamma and alpha power when they are enhanced by stimulation, and it is enhanced for alpha power when it is reduced by stimulation. This suggests a potential inverse relation between changes in band-limited power and the corresponding CV. We propose that the CV(log(power ratio)) is a useful metric that can be computed for numerous existing and future LFP, EEG or MEG datasets, which will provide insights into those signals frequency-specific variability and how they might be used for neuronal coding and decoding."
"Humans have spent approximately 99.5% of the 2.5 million years of evolutionary history as hunter-gatherers, which helped to evolutionarily mold our minds and bodies to the hunting and gathering lifestyle. Physical activity associated with hunting animals, gathering plants, and evading predators is essential for human survival, evolution, and prosperity. Thus, physical activity (acute stress) is mostly beneficial to the body, whereas psycho-emotional stress (chronic stress) is usually detrimental at the psychological, physiological, and pathological levels. Although physical activity exerts anticancer effects and psycho-emotional stress exhibits cancer-promoting effects, both function through the same pathway involving activation of the sympathetic nervous system, release of catecholamines, and stimulation of {beta}2 adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AR) expressed on cancer cells. Here, salmeterol xinafoate was chosen to mimic physical activity. A once-weekly administration of salmeterol xinafoate by the intraperitoneal, inhalation, or transdermal route, dose-dependently extended latency, reduced cancer incidence and growth, and prolonged survival in vivo. Remarkably, the best complete response rates were 75%, 30%, and 71.43% for the therapeutic treatment of lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma, respectively. Notably, the salmeterol xinafoate doses used in our experiments are comparable to those used in patients. Moreover, in endogenous {beta}2AR knockout cancer cells, the exogenous {beta}2AR mutant with impaired salmeterol xinafoate binding or downstream signaling prevented the anticancer effects of salmeterol xinafoate in vivo, demonstrating the on-target action of salmeterol xinafoate on cancer cells and the requirement of the downstream signaling pathway. Finally, we showed that treatment with salmeterol xinafoate dose-dependently decreased the self-renewal capacity of lung cancer stem cells, breast cancer stem cells, and melanoma stem cells. From the perspective of human evolution into cancer biology, our study reveals that {beta}2AR represents an ideal anticancer drug target and that salmeterol xinafoate monotherapy has strong anticancer activity."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed medical imaging, driving advancements in radiology and endoscopy. Semantic segmentation, a pixel-level technique crucial for delineating pathological features, has become a cornerstone of digital pathology. Pathology segmentation AI models are often trained using annotations generated by pathologists. Despite the meticulous care typically exercised, these annotations frequently contain empirical label noise. However, the specific types of label noise in pathology data and their impact on AI model training remain inadequately explored. This study systematically investigated the effects of label noise on the performance of pathology segmentation models. Using publicly available datasets and a breast cancer semantic segmentation dataset, modules were developed to simulate four types of artificial label noise at varying intensity levels. These datasets were used to train deep learning models with encoder-decoder architectures, and their performance was evaluated using metrics such as the Dice coefficient, precision, recall, and intersection over union. The results indicated that models were highly susceptible to overfitting label noise, particularly boundary-dependent noise such as dilation and shrinkage. Discrepancies were identified between apparent performance scores obtained under real-world conditions and true performance scores derived using clean test data. This overestimation risk was most pronounced for datasets containing boundary-altering noise. Furthermore, random combinations of noise types and levels significantly impaired model generalization. This study underscores the critical importance of addressing label noise in pathology datasets. It is proposed that future efforts focus on developing standardized methods for quantifying and mitigating label noise, along with creating robust benchmarks using noise-inclusive datasets. Enhancing annotation quality and addressing label noise can improve the reliability and generalizability of AI in pathology, facilitating broader clinical adoption."
"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are revealing an ever-growing number of genetic associations with disease, but identifying and functionally validating the causal variants underlying these associations is very challenging and has only been done for a vanishingly small number of variants. Here we validate a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with an increased risk of Alzheimers disease (AD) in an intronic enhancer of the PTK2B gene, by engineering it into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Upon differentiation to macrophages and microglia, this variant shows effects on chromatin accessibility of the enhancer and increased binding of the transcription factor CEBPB but only subtle effects on PTK2B or CLU expression. Nevertheless, this variant results in global changes to the transcriptome and phenotype of these cells. Expression of interferon gamma responsive genes including chemokine transcripts and their protein products are altered, and chemotaxis of the resulting microglial cells is affected. This variant thus causes disease-relevant transcriptomic and phenotypic changes, and we propose that it acts by altering microglia reactivity, consistent with the role of these cells in progression of AD."
"Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) provide a fundamental framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern gene expression. Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have enabled GRN inference at cellular resolution; however, most existing approaches rely on predefined clusters or cell states, implicitly assuming static regulatory programs and potentially missing subtle, dynamic variation in regulation across individual cells. To address these limitations, we introduce NeighbourNet (NNet), a method that constructs cell-specific co-expression networks. NNet first applies principal component analysis to embed gene expression into a low-dimensional space, followed by local regression within each cells k-nearest neighbourhood (KNN) to quantify co-expression. This approach improves computational efficiency and stabilises co-expression estimates, mitigating challenges posed by small sample sizes in KNN regression and the inherent noise and sparsity of scRNA-seq data. Beyond co-expression, NNet supports scalable downstream analyses, including (i) clustering and aggregating cell-specific networks into meta-networks that capture primary co-expression patterns, and (ii) integrating prior knowledge to annotate co-expression and infer active signalling interactions at the individual cell level. All functional modules of NNet are implemented with an efficient algorithm that enables application to large-scale single-cell datasets. We demonstrate NNets effectiveness through three case studies on transcription factor activity prediction, early haematopoiesis, and tumour microenvironments. Provided as an R package, NNet offers a novel framework for exploring cellular variation in co-expression and integrates seamlessly with existing single-cell analysis workflows."
"Nasal colonization by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with an increased risk of infection by these pathobionts, whereas nasal colonization by Dolosigranulum species is associated with health. Human nasal epithelial organoids (HNOs) physiologically recapitulate human nasal respiratory epithelium with a robust mucociliary blanket. We reproducibly monocolonized HNOs with these three bacteria for up to 48 hours with varying kinetics across species. HNOs tolerated bacterial monocolonization with localization of bacteria to the mucus layer and with minimal cytotoxicity compared to uncolonized HNOs. Human nasal epithelium exhibited both species-specific and general cytokine responses, without induction of type I interferons, consistent with colonization rather than infection. Only live S. aureus colonization robustly induced IL-1 family cytokines, suggestive of inflammasome signaling. D. pigrum and live S. aureus decreased CXCL10, whereas S. pneumoniae increased CXCL11, chemokines involved in antimicrobial responses to both viruses and bacteria. Overall, HNOs are a compelling model system to reveal host-microbe dynamics at the human nasal mucosa.

IMPORTANCEHuman nasal microbiota often includes highly pathogenic members, many of which are antimicrobial resistance threats, e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Preventing colonization by nasal pathobionts decreases infections and transmission. In contrast, nasal microbiome studies identify candidate beneficial bacteria that might resist pathobiont colonization, e.g., Dolosigranulum pigrum. Discovering how these microbionts colonize the human nasal passages and means to reduce pathobiont colonization is limited by previous models. This creates an urgent need for human-based models that exemplify bacterial nasal colonization. We addressed this need by developing human nasal epithelial organoids (HNOs) as a new model system of bacterial nasal colonization. HNOs accurately represent the mucosal surface of the human nasal passages enabling exploration of bacterial-epithelial interactions, which is crucial since the epithelium instigates the initial innate immune response to bacteria. Here, we identified differential epithelial cytokine responses to these three bacteria setting the stage for future research."
"The proliferation of single cell transcriptomics has potentiated our ability to unveil patterns that reflect dynamic cellular processes such as the regulation of gene transcription. In this study, we leverage a broad collection of single cell RNA-seq data to identify the gene partners whose expression is most coordinated with each human and mouse transcription regulator (TR). We assembled 120 human and 103 mouse scRNA-seq datasets from the literature (>28 million cells), constructing a single cell coexpression network for each. We aimed to understand the consistency of TR coexpression profiles across a broad sampling of biological contexts, rather than examine the preservation of context-specific signals. Our workflow therefore explicitly prioritizes the patterns that are most reproducible across cell types. Towards this goal, we characterize the similarity of each TRs coexpression within and across species. We create single cell coexpression rankings for each TR, demonstrating that this aggregated information recovers literature curated targets on par with ChIP-seq data. We then combine the coexpression and ChIP-seq information to identify candidate regulatory interactions supported across methods and species. Finally, we highlight interactions for the important neural TR ASCL1 to demonstrate how our compiled information can be adopted for community use.

Author SummaryA common way to analyze gene expression (transcriptomics) data is to correlate gene transcript levels across samples for every pair of genes (coexpression). Coordinated expression between genes may imply a shared biological function, though this warrants cautious interpretation given assumptions about cellular processes inferred from RNA abundances alone. Still, coexpression inference is often used to nominate genes whose expression may be controlled by transcription regulators (TRs). The rapid generation of diverse single cell transcriptomics data has unlocked our ability to discover coexpression patterns across individual cells -- though these signals are often noisy. Reproducible patterns across studies can help distinguish meaningful biological relationships from spurious correlations. We used this study to analyze a broad collection of single cell data spanning numerous tissues in human and mouse to infer global TR coexpression patterns. We aimed to learn which interactions were generally observable, to better potentiate future examinations of reproducible coexpression in specific contexts. We evaluate the predictive performance of these global single cell coexpression rankings using independent gene regulation evidence, and highlight TR-gene pairs that are supported across data modalities as well as species. By disseminating these rankings, we hope that other researchers can extract insight for their own TRs of interest."
"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) replication relies on the multifunctional nsP2 protein, making it an attractive target for antiviral drug discovery. Here, we report the resolution of oxaspiropiperidine 1, a first-in-class inhibitor of the CHIKV nsP2 RNA helicase (nsP2hel), into its constitutive enantiomers and characterization of their antiviral activity. The enantiomer (R)-1 exhibited potent inhibition of viral replication, nsP2hel ATPase activity, and dsRNA unwinding, while the (S)-1 enantiomer was >100-fold less active. The (R)-1 enantiomer also demonstrated high selectivity for CHIKV over other RNA viruses and for nsP2hel over other RNA helicases. Direct binding of (R)-1 to nsP2hel protein was confirmed by 19F NMR. Biophysical and structural studies revealed conformational polymorphism in the spirocyclic scaffold of (R)-1, suggesting a potential role of thermal mobility of the ligand in allosteric inhibition of nsP2hel. Collectively, these findings designate (R)-1 (RA-NSP2-1) as a high-quality chemical probe and (S)-1 (RA-NSP2-1N) as a negative control for probing the biology of alphavirus RNA helicases."
"Enviromics is an omics approach that investigates a phenomenon using all available environmental information. This study explores the use of enviromic covariates in studies of genotype x environment (GxE) interactions in upland rice in Brazil, utilizing a field trial dataset from 143 locations over 27 years, covering diverse environmental conditions. The platforms WorldClim, NASA POWER, and SoilGrids were used to extract data, resulting in 383 environmental covariates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of enviromic kernels to integrate GIS and genetic data for predicting upland rice productivity across Brazil and to determine the optimal number of environmental covariates required to ensure model accuracy and stability. The predictive abilities of the enviromic model peaked with around 81 covariates, stabilizing when all 383 were included, suggesting the importance of a comprehensive dataset for accurate predictions. Analysis reveals that environmental dissimilarities are more critical than geographical distance for genotypic variability, reinforcing the need to consider multiple covariates in predictive models. Heritability mapping revealed spatial variations, with regions of high heritability concentrated in southern Brazil, where genetic selection may be more efficient. The clustering of mega-environments was not efficient, highlighting the complexity of GxE interactions, and confirming that pixel-by-pixel enviromic models are a safer approach for recommending breeding actions for upland rice. This study suggests strategies to improve genotype selection for specific conditions, guiding the expansion of rice cultivation into new agricultural areas in Brazil. The findings also contribute to rice-growing regions worldwide, especially in countries cultivating upland rice under diverse conditions.

Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSObjectiveC_ST_ABSThis study aimed to evaluate the predictive ability of enviromic models for site-specific recommendations in upland rice, focusing on genotype x environment (GxE) interactions by integrating environmental and phenotypic data.

MethodsA total of 734 field trials conducted between 1995 and 2022 across 143 Brazilian locations were analyzed. Environmental data (383 covariates) were retrieved from WorldClim, NASA POWER, and SoilGrids using GIS-based procedures. Statistical analyses included mixed linear models and Random Forest to correct for design effects, estimate heritability, and perform spatial predictions.

ResultsEnvironmental dissimilarity better explained genotypic ranking than geographic distance. Predictive ability plateaued after 81 covariates, but adding more covariates reduced variance and increased model stability, supporting the use of comprehensive environmental data.

ConclusionsThe study reinforces the need for detailed environmental characterization and the use of comprehensive enviromic models. Pixel-based predictions are more reliable than broad clustering approaches, supporting the use of virtual trials to optimize breeding strategies and resource allocation."
"Aging and Alzheimers disease (AD) are associated with alterations in functional connectivity (FC), yet their spatial and temporal characteristics remain debated. Whole-cortex functional gradients, which organize regions along axes of functional similarity, are positioned here as a framework for understanding such alterations. Across two independent cohorts (BioFINDER-2, N=973; ADNI, N=129), we demonstrate that hyper- and hypoconnectivity in both healthy aging and biomarker-confirmed AD progression coexist systematically, forming consistent spatial patterns that align with two distinct axes of brain organization. Using a combination of longitudinal and non-linear analyses, we show that the early (but not late) stages of AD pathology accumulation is associated with functional alteration along the sensory-association axis, a pattern that vanishes in later stages of AD. However, functional alteration along the sensory-association axis is associated with worse cognition throughout the AD spectrum, and even in older adults without AD pathology, suggesting that these FC patterns may reflect a general neural response to cognitive strain. Independently of AD, older age was associated with alterations instead along the executive-nonexecutive axis, a finding that was consistent throughout the adult lifespan. These findings highlight the fundamental role of intrinsic functional organization in shaping how the brain responds to aging and to AD, helping to resolve previously reported discrepancies."
"The nucleus reuniens (RE) is a midline thalamic structure interconnecting the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus (HPC). Recent work in both rodents and humans implicates the RE in the adaptive regulation of emotional memories, including the suppression of learned fear. However, the neural correlates of aversive learning in the RE of rodents and humans remains unclear. To address this, we recorded RE activity in humans (BOLD fMRI) and rats (fiber photometry) during Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction. In both rats and humans, we found that conditioned stimulus (CS)-evoked activity in RE reflects the associative value of the CS. In rats, we additionally found that spontaneous neural activity in RE tracks defensive freezing and shows anticipatory increases in calcium activity that precede the termination of freezing behavior. Single-unit recordings in rats confirmed that individual RE neurons index both the associative value of the CS and defensive behavior transitions. Moreover, distinct neuronal ensembles in the RE encode fear versus extinction memories. These findings suggest a conserved role of the RE across species in modulating defensive states and emotional memory processes, providing a foundation for future translational research on fear-related disorders."
"O_LIWhile aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) methods have reached relative maturity, the use of terrestrial eDNA is nascent and serious methodological improvements are needed to achieve widespread use. Field-ready applications require eDNA survey methods where samples are easy to collect by inexperienced practitioners, easy to transport between the field and lab, and easy to process thereafter. Here, we demonstrate methods that satisfy these requirements and show strong potential for characterizing diverse terrestrial eDNA samples collected from flower and leaf surfaces.
C_LIO_LIWe used novel methods to collect and process 236 flower eDNA samples and 21 leaf surface eDNA samples, obtaining 2,228 Arthropoda eDNA detections spanning 175 families using amplicon sequencing of two genetic markers.
C_LIO_LIDetected taxa were diverse and included numerous groups of conservation concern, such as bees (Hymenoptera; Anthophila, 32 genera spanning 5 families) and Lepidoptera (209 genera from 21 families). Data reveal strong associations between insect community richness and remotely sensed measures of forest habitat, providing a quantitative perspective of relevance to insect conservation.
C_LIO_LIIt is increasingly clear that a variety of organisms readily disperse eDNA throughout the environment, supporting the notion that eDNA will be a powerful tool for characterizing species distributions and monitoring at-risk species. However, we conclude that researchers seeking to characterize fine-scale habitat associations or plant-pollinator interactions using eDNA will need to carefully design studies with appropriate field controls, such as the leaf surface eDNA samples collected here.

"MotivationBecause of the rapidly-growing amount of sequencing data, computing sketches of large textual datasets has become an essential preprocessing task. These sketches are typically much smaller than the input sequences, but preserve sufficient information for downstream analysis. Minimizers are an especially popular sketching technique and used in a wide variety of applications. They sample at least one out of every w consecutive k-mers. As DNA sequencers are getting more accurate, some applications can afford to use a larger w and hence sparser and smaller sketches. And as sketches get smaller, their analysis becomes faster, so the time spent sketching the full-sized input becomes more of a bottleneck.

MethodsOur library simd-minimizers implements a random minimizer algorithm using SIMD instructions. It supports both AVX2 and NEON architectures. Its main novelty is two-fold. First, it splits the input into 8 chunks that are streamed over in parallel through all steps of the algorithm. This is enabled by using the completely deterministic two-stacks sliding window minimum algorithm, which seems not to have been used before for finding minimizers.

ResultsOur library is up to 6.8x faster than a scalar implementation of the rescan method when w = 5 is small, and 3.4x faster for larger w = 19. Computing canonical minimizers is less than 50% slower than computing forward minimizers, and over 15x faster than the existing implementation in the minimizer-iter crate. Our library finds all (canonical) minimizers of a 3.2 Gbp human genome in 5.2 (resp. 6.7) seconds."
"Targeted protein degraders that recruit the von-hippel Lindau E3-ligase complex often have poor physicochemical properties, requiring extensive medicinal chemistry optimization prior to use in hypothesis-testing experiments in vivo, and with few blood-brain-barrier permeable examples disclosed. In this study, we systematically examine a panel of fatty acid promoieties as agents to enhance degrader pharmacokinetics and BBB-exposure. We characterize effects on cellular E3-ligase engagement, cellular BRD4 degradation kinetics, murine plasma stability, and murine blood plasma and brain pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We identify degrader prodrugs with significantly improved CNS exposure relative to the parent degrader. This led to successful BRD4. degradation in perfused brain samples, demonstrating that fatty acid promoieties can accelerate progress towards proof of principle in vivo experiments for CNS degrader projects."
"Mosquitoes, as critical vectors of diseases such as Japanese encephalitis, dengue fever, and yellow fever, pose significant public health risks in Chengdu, a subtropical city in southwestern China. This study integrated ecological surveillance and PacBio third-generation sequencing to characterize the symbiotic microbiota of four dominant mosquito species (Aedes albopictus, Culex pipiens, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, and Armigeres subalbatus) across urban and rural habitats. From 2020 to 2024, mosquito density monitoring revealed spatial heterogeneity(Aedes albopictus, Culex pipiens, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, and Anopheles sinensis), with outer ring areas exhibiting the highest density (34.69 mosquitoes per trap), while central urban zones had the lowest (3.60). Sequencing identified 717 high-quality Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), with Aedes albopictus harboring the most unique bacterial species (191). Beta diversity analysis demonstrated distinct microbial clustering among species, driven by Pseudomonadota dominance (54.27-93.89%) and variations in secondary phyla (Bacteroidota, Campylobacterota). Functional prediction via KEGG highlighted elevated human disease-associated pathways in Ae. albopictus, contrasting with reduced environmental adaptation activity. Notably, Wolbachia (clade B) and Klebsiella variicola exhibited species-specific abundance patterns, underscoring their roles in pathogen suppression and public health risks. Unclassified taxa (norank_d Bacteria, Candidatus_Hydrogenedentes) clustered near novel mosquito-associated spirochetes, suggesting underexplored functional microbiota. This study provides foundational data for understanding mosquito-microbe interactions and informs strategies for mitigating vector-borne disease.

Author SummaryMosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis pose severe public health risks in subtropical regions, yet critical gaps remain in understanding how mosquito-associated microbes influence disease transmission in under-resourced areas. Chengdu, a megacity in southwestern China, faces unique challenges due to rapid urbanization, climatic suitability for mosquito proliferation, and disparities in public health infrastructure compared to eastern coastal regions. This study integrates five years of ecological surveillance (2020-2024) and PacBio third-generation sequencing to map mosquito density patterns and characterize symbiotic bacterial communities in four dominant mosquito species (Aedes albopictus, Culex pipiens, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, and Armigeres subalbatus).

Key findings reveal stark spatial heterogeneity in mosquito density, with rural outer-ring areas harboring 10-fold higher densities (34.69 mosquitoes/trap) than urban centers. Notably, Aedes albopictus exhibited the highest diversity of unique symbiotic bacteria (191 species), including Wolbachia (clade B), known to suppress arboviruses like dengue. Conversely, Armigeres subalbatus carried high abundances of Klebsiella variicola, an emerging human pathogen linked to severe infections. Functional analyses further highlighted elevated human disease-associated pathways in Ae. albopictus, underscoring its dual role as a disease vector and microbial reservoir.

This work provides the first comprehensive baseline data on mosquito-microbe interactions in Chengdu, identifying actionable targets for biocontrol (e.g., leveraging Wolbachia) and early-warning systems for pathogen surveillance. By bridging ecological, molecular, and public health perspectives, our findings offer critical insights for mitigating neglected tropical diseases in subtropical regions where socioeconomic disparities intersect with high disease burdens."
"The complex transcriptional regulatory relationships among genes influence gene expression levels and play crucial roles in determining cellular phenotypes. Here, we present a novel distributed large-scale transcriptional regulatory neural network model (DLTRNM) by integrating prior knowledge into the reconstruction of pre-trained machine learning models followed with fine-tuning. Taken S. cerevisiae as the example, the transcriptional regulatory relationships, carefully compiled and documented, are utilized to define interactions between TFs and their TGs within DLTRNM. Subsequently, DLTRNM is pre-trained on pan-transcriptomic data and fine-tuned with time-series data, enabling it to accurately predict dynamic regulatory correlations between TFs and TGs, such as simulating TG responses by tuning the expression of TFs. In addition, DLTRNM can assist in identifying potential key TFs for a subset of genes, thus simplifying the complex and interrelated transcriptional regulatory networks (TRN). Based on the key TFs, it can also refine previously reported transcriptional regulatory subnetworks and highlight the core regulatory networks. DLTRNM offers a powerful tool for studying transcriptional regulation with reduced computational demands and enhanced interpretability. Thus, this study represents a significant step forward in systems biology for understanding the complicated transcriptional regulation within cells."
"The skin microbiome is dominated by a few key genera, among which Staphylococcus is one of the most well-characterised. Recent studies have examined the roles of various Staphylococcus species such as S. epidermidis and S. hominis within broader skin microbial communities. However, these investigations often rely on isolates from multiple individuals and hence, limiting their ability to capture intra-community interactions. In this study, we focused on the axillary microbiome of a single healthy individual to characterise the genetic and functional diversity of resident Staphylococcus isolates. Using a low-cost, high-throughput DNA extraction and long-read whole genome sequencing pipeline, we generated complete genomes for 93 isolates spanning seven genetically distinct lineages across three major skin species. These comprised of one dominant with three additional lineages of S. epidermidis, two of S. hominis and one of S. capitis. Functional and metabolic analyses revealed species- and strain-specific features, suggesting potential metabolic cross-feeding and specialisation within this community, including within strains of S. epidermidis. These findings highlight the metabolic complexity and potential interdependence of staphylococci inhabiting a single skin site and the need for strain-level resolution of the community. The strains form part of the York Skin Microbiome (YSM) collection, a growing open biobank of genetically diverse skin isolates from matched individuals."
"Harmonicity is an important feature for auditory perception as it influences pitch processing, memory and hearing in noisy environments. However, the neural substrates of processing harmonic and inharmonic sounds remain unclear. Here, we systematically manipulated the harmonicity of synthetic sounds by introducing random jittering to the frequencies above the fundamental. Using electroencephalography, we studied the spectral uncertainty induced by inharmonic sounds and the effect on markers of auditory prediction errors--mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a-- in a roving oddball paradigm. Inharmonic sounds with a constant jittering pattern generated similar MMN and stronger P3a responses than harmonic sounds. In contrast, MMN responses became undetectable when the jittering pattern changed between consecutive sounds, suggesting that prediction errors are weighted by sequential but not spectral uncertainty. Interestingly, inharmonic sounds generated an object-related negativity, a response associated with the segregation of auditory objects. Our results suggest that inharmonicity induces the segregation of the auditory scene into different streams, captures attention, and gives rise to specific neural processes that are independent from the predictive mechanisms underlying sequential deviance detection."
"Ubiquitin (Ub), a central regulator of protein turnover, can be phosphorylated by PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) to generate S65-phosphorylated ubiquitin (pUb). Elevated pUb levels have been observed in aged human brains and in Parkinsons disease, but the mechanistic link between pUb elevation and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that pUb elevation is a common feature under neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimers disease, aging, and ischemic injury. We show that impaired proteasomal activity leads to the accumulation of sPINK1, the cytosolic form of PINK1 that is normally proteasome-degraded rapidly. This accumulation increases ubiquitin phosphorylation, which then inhibits ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal activity by interfering with both ubiquitin chain elongation and proteasome-substrate interactions. Specific expression of sPINK1 in mouse hippocampal neurons induced progressive pUb accumulation, accompanied by protein aggregation, proteostasis disruption, neuronal injury, neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline. Conversely, pink1 knockout mitigated protein aggregation in both mouse brains and HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the detrimental effects of sPINK1 could be counteracted by co-expressing Ub/S65A phospho-null mutant but exacerbated by over-expressing Ub/S65E phospho-mimic mutant. Together, these findings reveal that pUb elevation, triggered by reduced proteasomal activity, inhibits proteasomal activity and forms a feedforward loop that drives progressive neurodegeneration."
"Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are present in 2-6% of the global population. While rare, rupture results in mortality rates of 30-50% and lifelong disabilities in survivors. While treatment of unruptured IAs carries its own risk of mortality, there are no rigid guidelines indicating which IA presentation is at greater risk of rupture. We develop and evaluate the suitability of various additive manufacturing processes to fabricate patient-specific IA culture models for understanding IA pathophysiology and thereby support future development of a rupture risk prediction tool.

Material compatibility of several 3D printed resins, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and collagen gel with immortalised human brain endothelial cells (HBECs) were investigated. Patient angiograms were segmented to produce in vitro models via two fabrication approaches: stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing versus chocolate injection moulding of a sacrificial core embedded in PDMS. These 3D arterial models were then cellularised with HBECs, and geometric accuracy and distension properties evaluated.

PDMS, collagen gel and the elastic50A resin materials supported cellularisation on material surfaces with high cell viability and proliferation. Both the 3D printed resin and injection moulding techniques successfully fabricated patient-specific basilar artery IA models with a Dice-Sorensen coefficient of over 90%. However, only PDMS models offered complete cell coverage in 3D geometries. This exceeds current benchmarks on IA fabrication accuracy. Through controlling IA model wall thickness, we demonstrate the ability to create localised distension under pressure in the context of thin- and thick-walled aneurysms.

In vitro IA models present a promising platform for investigating IA pathophysiology and rupture risk. The novel chocolate sacrificial core technique offers a biocompatible, support-free fabrication method suitable for 3D cultures. Given the independent effects of fluid dynamics and mechanical strain on cell behaviour, it is essential to characterise distension under pressure and ensure accurate fabrication for reliable analysis into cell behaviour."
"KdpFABC is an ATP-dependent membrane complex that enables prokaryotes to maintain potassium homeostasis under potassium-limited conditions. It features a unique hybrid mechanism combining a channel-like selectivity filter in KdpA with the ATP-driven transport functionality of KdpB. A key unresolved question is whether K+ ions translocate through the inter-subunit tunnel as a queue of ions or within a hydrated environment. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, metadynamics, anomalous X-ray scattering, and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that the tunnel is predominantly occupied by water molecules rather than multiple K+ ions. Our results identify only one stable intermediate binding site for K+ within the tunnel, apart from the canonical sites in KdpA and KdpB. Free energy calculations reveal a substantial barrier ([~]22 kcal/mol) at the KdpA-KdpB interface, making spontaneous K+ translocation unlikely. Furthermore, mutagenesis and functional assays confirm previous findings that Phe232 at this interface plays a key role in coupling ATP hydrolysis to K+ transport. These findings challenge previous models proposing a continuous wire of K+ ions through the tunnel and suggest the existence of an as-yet unidentified intermediate state or mechanistic detail that facilitates K+ movement into KdpB."
"The role of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in cognition is a frequently studied yet highly debated topic in neuroscience. Most authors agree that the dACC is involved in either cognitive control (e.g. voluntary inhibition of automatic responses) or monitoring (e.g. comparing expectations with outcomes, detecting errors, tracking surprise). A consensus on which theoretical perspective best explains dACC contribution to behaviour is still lacking, as two distinct sets of studies report dACC activation in tasks requiring surprise tracking for performance monitoring and cognitive control without involving surprise monitoring, respectively. This creates a theoretical impasse, as no single current account can reconcile these findings. Here we propose a novel hypothesis on dACC function that integrates both the monitoring and the cognitive control perspectives in a unifying, meta-Reinforcement Learning framework, in which cognitive control is optimized by meta-learning based on tracking Bayesian surprise. We tested the quantitative predictions from our theory in two different functional neuroimaging studies at the basis of the current theory crisis. We show that the meta-Reinforcement Learning perspective successfully captures all the neuroimaging results by predicting both cognitive control and monitoring functions, resolving the theoretical impasse about dACC function within an integrative framework. In sum, our results suggest that dACC function can be framed as a meta-learning optimisation of cognitive control, providing an integrative perspective on its roles in cognitive control, surprise tracking, and performance monitoring.

Significance statementAn important debate in cognitive neuroscience concerns the role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in cognition. Two effective and competing frameworks suggest a role for the ACC in surprise monitoring or optimizing cognitive control, respectively. So far, none of these frameworks has succeeded as a unified theory of ACC function. In this study, we reanalyzed previous neuroimaging data on ACC activity during cognitive tasks using a novel computational perspective: meta-Reinforcement Learning. We show that this computational framework can explain a variety of data on ACC function that, globally, could not be captured by any of the previous models. We propose that meta-Reinforcement Learning offers a unified theory of ACC cognitive and computational function."
"Plasmid conjugation is a major driver of antibiotic resistance dissemination in bacteria. In addition to genes required for transfer and maintenance, conjugative plasmids encode exclusion systems that prevent host cells from acquiring identical or redundant plasmids. Despite their ubiquity, the biological impact of these systems remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the importance of the exclusion mechanism for plasmid dynamics and bacterial physiology at the single-cell level. Using real-time microscopy, we directly visualize how the absence of exclusion results in plasmid unregulated self-transfer, causing continuous and repeated plasmid exchange among host cells. This runaway conjugation severely compromises cell integrity, viability, and fitness, a largely undescribed phenomenon termed lethal zygosis. We demonstrate that lethal zygosis is associated with membrane stress, activation of the SOS response and potential reactivation of SOS-inducible prophages, as well as chromosome replication and segregation defects. This study highlights how exclusion systems maintain host cell homeostasis by limiting plasmid transfer. Paradoxically, this restriction is critical to the successful dissemination of conjugative plasmids by conferring a selective advantage, which explains their evolutionary conservation and underscores their role in the spread of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria."
"Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs) represent a class of new psychoactive substances that pose great health risks attributed to their wide-ranging and severe adverse effects. Recent evidence has shown that SCRAs with key moieties can confer superagonism, yet this phenomenon is still not well understood. In this study, we developed a structure-activity relationship (SAR) for SCRA superagonism by comparing eight compounds differing by their head moiety (l-valinate vs. l-tert-leucinate), core moiety (indole vs. indazole), and tail moiety (5-fluoropentyl vs. 4-fluorobenzyl) through different modes of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). We found that l-tert-leucinate head moiety and indazole core moiety conferred superagonism across multiple Gi/o proteins and {beta}-arrestin 2. After generating CB1R mutant constructs, we found that transmembrane 2 (TM2) interactions to the head moiety of tested SCRAs at F170, F177, and H178 are key to eliciting activity. Finally, we found that l-tert-leucinate SCRAs confer a high-efficacy response in ex vivo slice electrophysiology."
"Ion transport within mitochondria influences their structure, energy production, and cell death regulation. TMBIM5, a conserved calcium/proton exchanger in the inner mitochondrial membrane, contributes to mitochondrial structure, ATP synthesis, and apoptosis regulation. The relationship of TMBIM5 with the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex formed by MCU, MICU1-3, and EMRE remains undefined. We generated Tmbim5-deficient Drosophila that exhibit disrupted cristae architecture, premature mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, reduced calcium uptake, and mitochondrial swelling - resulting in impaired mobility and shortened lifespan. Crossing these with flies lacking mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex proteins was generally detrimental, but partial MICU1 depletion ameliorated the Tmbim5-deficiency phenotype. In human cells, MICU1 rescues morphological defects in TMBIM5-knockout mitochondria, while TMBIM5 overexpression exacerbates size reduction in MICU1-knockout mitochondria. Both proteins demonstrated opposing effects on submitochondrial localization and coexisted in the same macromolecular complex. Our findings establish a functional interplay between TMBIM5 and MICU1 in maintaining mitochondrial integrity, with implications for understanding calcium homeostasis mechanisms."
"Pinctada radiata, commonly known as the Gulf pearl oyster, is a species of pearl oyster found primarily in the warm waters of the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, and parts of the Indian Ocean. Pinctada radiata contributes to marine ecosystems by filtering water, which helps maintain water quality and supports other marine life. This species is the first bivalve Lessepsian migrant, having migrated from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal. The reference genome of Pinctada radiata could help identify genes enabling adaptation to varying temperatures and salinities, facilitating survival in diverse and newly colonized habitats allowing comparisons with other bivalves to uncover shared and unique genetic adaptations. Additionally, the genome could support targeted management practices and conservation initiatives, such as habitat restoration and selective breeding, ensuring the long-term sustainability of P. radiata. The entirety of the genome sequence was assembled into 14 contiguous chromosomal pseudomolecules. This chromosome-level assembly encompasses 0.93 Gb, composed of 220 contigs and 44 scaffolds, with contig and scaffold N50 values of 8.1 Mb and 63.8 Mb, respectively."
"Drug repurposing offers a promising strategy to accelerate therapeutic discovery for complex diseases; however, conventional approaches often overlook the multi-scale, dynamic nature of drug-induced perturbations. In this study, we introduce PETS (Pre-dictive Evaluation of Therapeutic Simulations), an innovative in silico framework that synergistically integrates curated pathway models with multi-layer network propagation, adaptive dampening, and memory mechanisms to simulate drug-gene interactions with high fidelity. By propagating perturbations through tissue- and cell-specific protein-protein interaction networks via iterative state updates, PETS robustly captures both proximal and distal regulatory feedback, enabling the identification and ranking of drug candidates capable of reversing disease-specific gene expression signatures. Validation against the SigCom L1000 dataset demonstrates that PETS achieves lower mean squared errors and higher predictive consistency compared to existing methods across models of Alzheimers disease, AD-expressing neuroblastoma, and glioblastoma multiforme. Moreover, PETS concurrently quantifies on-target therapeutic efficacy and potential off-target toxicity, providing mechanistic insights that are critical for candidate prioritization. Looking ahead, the integration of patient-specific multi-omics data and dynamic network topologies is expected to further enhance the translational impact of PETS. Our framework represents a significant advancement in the computational prediction of drug-gene perturbation effects, positioning it as a cornerstone tool for precision medicine and preclinical drug discovery."
"Biological membranes are not just passive barriers--they actively sense and respond to mechanical forces, in part through specialized proteins embedded within them. Among these are Stomatin-family proteins, which are known to influence membrane stiffness and regulate ion channels, yet how they achieve these functions at the molecular level has remained elusive. Here, we report the 2.2 [A] cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human Stomatin complex in a native membrane environment. We find that Stomatin assembles into a 16-subunit ring-shaped homo-oligomer, forming a [~]12 nm-wide cage that defines a mechanically distinct, curvature-resistant membrane microdomain. While the majority of the complex exhibits C16 symmetry, the C-terminal domains adopt two alternating conformations, producing a symmetry-broken hydrophobic {beta}-barrel pore with local C8 symmetry. The membrane beneath the complex remains flat despite surrounding curvature, indicating localized membrane stiffening. The structure reveals a conserved network of inter-subunit salt bridges that stabilize the assembly. These findings provide a molecular framework for how Stomatin oligomers shape membrane architecture and mechanics, offering new insight into their roles in mechanotransduction and diseases such as nephrotic syndrome."
"Synthetic combinatorial DNA libraries are widely used to produce protein variants, optimize binders, and for high throughput studies of protein - DNA interactions. The libraries can be made by researchers or vendors and high-throughput sequencing is used for both quality control and to study the outcome of selection experiments. Oxford nanopore sequencing (ONT) is well suited to this as it allows for long read lengths and can be done rapidly with low-cost instrumentation. However, it suffers from a lower overall read accuracy and an uneven error profile. No current bioinformatics tools are well suited to the challenge of deducing the composition and order of constituent members of combinatorial libraries from ONT reads.

We introduce cONcat, an algorithm to identify the makeup of concatenated DNA fragments in a set of ONT sequencing reads from a pool of known fragments. cONcat uses the edit distance-based recursive covering algorithm for finding the best possible matchings between the fragments and the reads. In our experiments on simulated and experimental data, cONcat could accurately detect the correct fragment coverings given the short fragment sizes (< 20bp) and the sequencing errors present in ONT reads. However, we find that the high error rates in the start of ONT reads make it challenging to get confident coverage there, inferring a need for experimental strategies to avoid key sequence information in the start of reads."
"Sequence-specific interactions of transcription factors (TFs) with genomic DNA underlie many cellular processes. High-throughput in vitro binding assays coupled with machine learning have made it possible to accurately define such molecular recognition in a biophysically interpretable way for hundreds of TFs across many structural families, providing new avenues for predicting how the sequence preference of a TF is impacted by disease-associated mutations in its DNA binding domain. We developed a method based on a reference-free tetrahedral representation of variation in base preference within a given structural family that can be used to accurately predict the effect of mutations in the protein sequence of the TF. Using the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and homeodomain families as test cases, our results demonstrate the feasibility of accurately predicting the shifts ({Delta}{Delta}{Delta}G/RT) in binding free energy associated with TF mutants by leveraging high-quality DNA binding models for sets of homologous wild-type TFs.

"A ubiquitous phenomenon observed along the ventral stream of the primate hierarchical visual system is the suppression of neural responses to familiar stimuli at the population level. The observation of the suppression of the neural response in the early visual cortex (V1 and V2) to familiar stimuli of size that are multiple times larger in size than the receptive fields of individual neurons reflects the plausible development of recurrent circuits for encoding these global stimuli. In this work, we investigated the neural mechanisms of familiarity suppression and showed that an excitatory recurrent neural circuit, consisting of neurons with small and local receptive fields, can develop to encode specific global familiar stimuli robustly as a result of familiarity training. This Hebbian learning based model attributes the observed familiarity suppression effect to the sparsification of the population neural code for the familiar stimuli due to the formation of image-specific local excitatory circuits and competitive normalization among neurons, leading to the paradoxical neural response suppression to the familiar stimuli at the population level. We explored the computational implications of the proposed circuit by relating it to the sparse manifold transform. The recurrent circuit, by linking spatially co-occurring visual features together, compresses the dimensions of irrelevant variations of a familiar image in the neural response manifold relative to the dimensions for discriminating different familiar stimuli. The computation can be considered as a globally non-linear but locally linear manifold transform that orthogonalizes the slow modes of network dynamics relative to the subspace of irrelevant stimulus variations, resulting in increased robustness of the global stimulus representation against noises and other irrelevant perturbations. These results provide testable predictions for neurophysiological experiments.

Author summaryIn this research, we explored how the brain can become more efficient at processing familiar visual information. When we repeatedly see something, our brains response to it changes. In response to familiar stimuli, neurons across the different visual areas of the mammalian visual system become more selective and their overall activities decrease. We developed a computational model to investigate why this happens and what functional advantages these mechanisms might provide. We discovered that familiarity leads to the development of a more efficient and robust neural representation of what we see. It allows us to rapidly and robustly recognize our friends face despite changes in lighting conditions, view angle, or facial expression. Our model showed that through repeated exposure, the brains neural circuits, even in the early stages of visual processing, rapidly adapt and organize themselves to focus on important and consistent features in our visual environment while becoming less sensitive to irrelevant variations, and distractions."
"Bats exhibit a diverse array of social behaviors, yet detailed studies on the intricacies of these interactions, particularly in rare species like the spectral bat (Vampyrum spectrum), remain scarce. This study presents the first comprehensive description of prey sharing and other social behaviors in a wild social group of V. spectrum. Over several months, we conducted extensive video recordings in a hollow tree, used as a day- and night-roost, to document these behaviors, aiming to elucidate key social interactions among the bats and their role within their ecological niche. We observed various remarkable social behaviors, including food sharing between family members. Our findings support the hypothesis that prey sharing as a form of biparental care may serve as a method for adults to transition young bats from milk to a carnivorous diet, ensuring adequate food intake and allowing them to practice how to handle large prey items. We also challenge the notion that V. spectrum forages exclusively solitarily, as we documented several instances of synchronized roost departures and returns and thus presumably cooperative foraging. This indicates a more complex social structure and behavioral ecology than previously understood. Our comprehensive analysis of observational data enhances our understanding of the social dynamics of V. spectrum, providing new insights into the evolution of cooperative behaviors in bats.

HighlightsExtensive parental care: Most likely both male and female spectral bats participate in parental care, e.g. food provisioning, a rare behavior among mammals
Prey sharing as a social cooperative behavior: Detailed observations of prey sharing within the roost, highlighting social cooperation and resource allocation
Extended dependency period for pups: A prolonged developmental period allows pups to receive care and acquire essential survival skills until they achieve full independence
Juvenile play: Pups engaged predominantly in social play (mock fights), but also played with objects or food items, a rare behavior among bats"
"Phosphate is often a limiting resource, directly affecting the availability of key biomolecules such as nucleotides. To cope with phosphate scarcity, bacteria have evolved enzymes that utilize alternative phosphorus compounds, including phosphite (Pt). Although a few enzymes oxidize Pt to produce phosphate, the enzymes responsible for Pt oxidation in many environmental bacteria remain unidentified, and the role of microbial Pt oxidation in the global phosphorus cycle is not yet fully understood. In this study, we performed bioinformatic analyses of three Pt-oxidizing enzymes: the native Pt oxidase phosphite dehydrogenase (PtxD), and two promiscuous Pt oxidases, alkaline phosphatase (AP) and carbon-phosphorus (CP) lyase. Among these, AP was found to be widely distributed across bacteria since the early stages of their evolution. In contrast, PtxD emerged later in a limited number of bacterial lineages that had lost AP. Our biochemical characterizations revealed that most extant and reconstructed ancestral APs tested exhibited Pt oxidation activity. Moreover, disruption of active-site residues diminished Pt oxidase activity in AP, while only partially affecting its native function. This promiscuous function of AP reveals an overlooked mechanism in bacterial phosphate metabolism and underscores the role of Pt in the cycling of bioavailable phosphorus in ecosystems."
"Resistance training (RT) promotes muscle protein accretion and myofiber hypertrophy, driven by dynamic processes of protein synthesis and degradation. While molecular studies have focused on acute signalling or long-term hypertrophy and strength gains, a critical gap remains in understanding the intermediate processes of muscle adaptation. Acute signalling does not always correlate directly with long-term outcomes, highlighting the need for a time-course analysis of protein abundance and turnover rates. To address this, we utilised deuterium oxide labelling and peptide mass spectrometry to quantify absolute protein content and synthesis rates in skeletal muscle. A daily programmed resistance training regimen was applied to the rat tibialis anterior (TA) via electrical stimulation of the left hind limb for 10, 20, and 30 days (5 sets of 10 repetitions daily). Muscle samples from stimulated (Stim) and contralateral control (Ctrl) limbs were analysed, quantifying 658 protein abundances and 215 protein synthesis rates. Unsupervised temporal clustering of protein responses revealed distinct phases of muscle adaptation, with early (0-10 days) and mid (10-20 days) responses driven by differential protein accretion rates in ribosomal and mitochondrial networks, respectively. These findings suggest that subsets of proteins exhibit distinct adaptation timelines due to variations in translation and/or degradation rates. A deeper understanding of these temporal shifts could improve strategies for optimising muscle growth and functional adaptation to resistance training."
"Microphthalmia (MCOP) is a developmental eye disorder in which one or both eyes are abnormally small. This condition is often accompanied by cognitive impairments. Teneurin-3, a cell adhesion molecule with important functions in axon pathfinding and synaptic organization, has been repeatedly implicated with MCOP, suggesting its potential role in the etiology of this complex developmental disorder. It was previously shown that two small alternatively spliced exons - inserts A and B - instigate large structural reorganizations of the teneurin-3 covalent homodimer. Here, we map the MCOP mutation R2579W to an intramolecular interface specific to splice insert A-containing isoforms. We demonstrate that the MCOP mutation leads to a loss of transcellular adhesion, predominantly affecting these isoforms. Using small-angle X-ray scattering we establish that, despite these functional disruptions, the structural compactness of all mutant isoforms is preserved. Molecular dynamics simulations predict a global stabilization of the A1 mutant molecule compared to its wildtype counterpart, due to changes in local compact dimer interactions around the mutated residue. We experimentally validate these findings with biophysical assays. With cryo-EM analysis, we confirm the overall compactness with reduced conformational flexibility and reveal that the mutant tryptophan binds to a hydrophobic pocket in the structure. With these data, we provide a model for how increased stability in cis disrupts trans oligomerization needed for cellular adhesion. Altogether, we demonstrate that the MCOP-associated mutation in teneurin-3 causally disrupts cellular adhesion in an isoform-specific manner, thereby likely directly contributing to the development of the disease in MCOP patients."
"The group vigilance hypothesis suggests animals within a group have a lower overall vigilance level than solitary individuals due to the collective responsibility of predator detection. Previous methods of studying vigilance have used head position as a proxy to indicate a state of vigilance, but it has been suggested that this method is too ambiguous, and the observer cannot accurately ascertain the exact behavioural state of the focal animal. Here, we consider blinking as a proxy for vigilance, as the eye-closure during a blink momentarily reduces the animals information about the environment, increasing the risk of unanticipated predator attack. We videoed semi-captive herds of red deer Cervus elaphus and fallow deer Dama dama, and quantified their blinking behaviour using behavioural logging software. We show that blink rate decreased with increasing group size in both species, suggesting that blinking may be tied with social vigilance rather than anti-predator vigilance. Similarly, the length of the inter-blink interval increased with increasing group size in red deer. We discuss the suitability of blinking measures for assessing vigilance behaviour."
"N-terminal arginylation (Nt-arginylation) serves as a protein degradation signal in both the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. However, the scarcity of arginylated proteins in cells and limitations in current identification methods have hindered progress in this field. In this study, we developed a novel integrated approach that combines N-terminomics (N-terminomic enrichment, LC-MS/MS, and tandem database search) with advanced machine learning-based filtering strategies to successfully identify in vivo Nt-arginylation with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. By utilizing Arg-starting peptides from missed cleavage products as physicochemical proxies for ATE1-mediated Nt-arginylation, we trained a transfer learning-based model to predict MS2 spectra and retention times of candidate peptides. Additionally, near-isobaric modifications were filtered by statistically analyzing mass error deviations in MS2 fragment ions. Using this approach, we identified 134 Nt-arginylation sites in thapsigargin-treated HeLa cells, revealing a significant increase of Nt-arginylome under unfolded protein response (UPR) stress. Arginylated proteins originate from various organelles, including ER, nucleus and mitochondria. Notably, arginylation frequently occurred at sites processed by caspases or where signal peptides had been cleaved. Several proteins identified in our arginylome study were validated for their interaction with the R-catcher, an Nt-Arginylation bait derived from the p62 ZZ domain. Temporal profiling of N-terminal arginylation sites post-stress induction via targeted proteomics revealed a sequential response pattern. The UPR signal transducer ATF4 exhibited the most rapid increase, followed by N-terminal arginylation of caspase-3 substrates, and subsequently by arginylation at signal peptide cleavage sites among endoplasmic reticulum proteins. Our novel machine learning-based filtering methodologies enable the discovery of rare post-translational modifications by implementing specialized filtering strategies tailored to the unique physicochemical properties of terminal modifications, with potential applications in biomarker discovery, drug target identification, and elucidation of disease-specific protein regulation mechanism."
"Gap junctions, formed by connexin proteins, establish direct electrical and metabolic coupling between cells, enabling coordinated tissue responses. These channels universally respond to intracellular pH changes, closing under acidic conditions to limit the spread of cytotoxic signals during cellular stress, such as ischemia. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we uncover insights into the structural mechanism of pH-gating in native lens connexin-46/50 (Cx46/50) gap junctions. Mild acidification drives lipid infiltration into the channel pore, displacing the N-terminal (NT) domain and stabilizing pore closure. Lipid involvement is both essential and fully reversible, with structural transitions involving an ensemble of gated-states formed through non-cooperative NT domain movement as well as minor populations of a distinct destabilized open-state. These findings provide molecular insights into pH-gating dynamics, illustrating how structural changes may regulate gap junction function under cellular stress and linking Cx46/50 dysregulation to age-related cataract formation."
"Detecting and quantifying the strength of selection is a main objective in population genetics. Since selection acts over multiple generations, many approaches have been developed to detect and quantify selection using genetic data sampled at multiple points in time. Such time series genetic data is commonly analyzed using Hidden Markov Models, but in most cases, under the assumption of additive selection. However, many examples of genetic variation exhibiting non-additive mechanisms exist, making it critical to develop methods that can characterize selection in more general scenarios. Here, we extend a previously introduced expectation-maximization algorithm for the inference of additive selection coefficients to the case of general diploid selection, in which the heterozygote and homozygote fitness are parameterized independently. We furthermore introduce a framework to identify bespoke modes of diploid selection from given data, a heuristic to account for variable population size, and a procedure for aggregating data across linked loci to increase power and robustness. Using extensive simulation studies, we find that our method accurately and efficiently estimates selection coefficients for different modes of diploid selection across a wide range of scenarios; however, power to classify the mode of selection is low unless selection is very strong. We apply our method to ancient DNA samples from Great Britain in the last 4,450 years, and detect evidence for selection in six genomic regions, including the well-characterized LCT locus. Our work is the first genome-wide scan characterizing signals of general diploid selection.

Author SummaryNatural selection increases the likelihood that beneficial genetic variants are passed from parent to offspring and thus forms the basis of genetic adaptation to novel environments. Genomic data sampled at multiple timepoints, such as genetic material extracted from ancient remains (ancient DNA) or data from evolve and resequence experiments, can enable more precise identification of genetic variants subject to selective pressure than contemporary samples alone. However, most methods for identifying genetic variation under selection focus on additive selection, where the fitness of the heterozygote is exactly intermediate between the homozygotes. Leveraging genetic data at multiple timepoints, we develop a method to detect additive and non-additive selection as well as to infer the most likely dominance mechanism. We apply our methods to a dataset of ancient DNA from Great Britain dated less than 4,450 years before present and identify six regions with signals of recent selection, including one at the TFR2 locus that has not been previously reported as a target of selection. Our work enables more accurate quantification of non-additive selection dynamics and can be used to test more complex models of selection."
"Electrical signals are fundamental regulators of cell migration and growing numbers of studies have demonstrated electrically guided cancer cell migration. Chondrosarcomas, cartilage forming tumors, are highly metastatic and resistant to chemo and radiation therapies. To measure cellular migration in a three-dimensional (3D) environment a device was 3D-printed to house a collagen gel with embedded cells while enabling direct current electric field (DC-EF) application. Articular chondrocytes and chondrosarcoma cells were exposed to a 1 V/cm electric field for a duration of 12 hours while tracking their migration behavior. We observed that both cell types migrated towards the anode while chondrosarcoma cells showed a stronger directional response. We observed an EF-induced shift from diffusive migration trajectories towards ballistic migration behavior in articular chondrocytes and directed  wobble migration in chondrosarcoma. In articular chondrocytes we observed significant increases in the length of protrusions directed towards the anode (p < 0.05), as opposed to cathode directed protrusions after EF-exposure. Notably chondrosarcoma cells exhibited tiny protrusions of less than a few microns in length which sporadically extruded and retracted. Chondrosarcoma cells were loaded with FluoVolt to track real-time changes in membrane potential. Cells exposed to a 1V/cm electric field for 30 seconds showed a dynamic cell membrane hyperpolarization and repolarization during EF-exposure with a maximum hyperpolarization approximated to be on the order of -5 mV. To our knowledge, these are the first descriptions of the effects of electrical fields on directional cell migration in a 3D environment."
"The critically important YUCCA (YUC) gene family is highly conserved and specific to the plant kingdom, primarily responsible for the final and rate-limiting step for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis. IAA is an essential phytohormone, involved in virtually all aspects of plant growth and development. In addition, IAA is involved in fine-tuning plant responses to biotic and abiotic interactions and stresses. While the YUC gene family has significantly expanded throughout the plant kingdom, a detailed analysis of the evolutionary patterns driving this diversification has not been performed. Here we present a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the YUC family, combining YUCs from species representing key evolutionary plant lineages. We identify and hierarchically classify the YUC family into six distinct classes and 41 subclasses. YUC diversity and expansion is explained in the context of protein sequence conservation, as well as spatial and gene expression patterns. The presented YUC gene landscape offers new perspectives on the distribution and evolutionary trends of this crucial family, which facilitates further YUC characterization within plant development and response to environmental change.

Short summaryComprehensive phylogenetic and sequence analysis of the YUC gene family presents new insights into factors driving evolutionary diversification.

"Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a vital crop for direct human consumption, with essential nutrients and valuable protein that provides food security in developing countries. However, its cultivation faces significant threats from Meloidogyne incognita, a root-knot nematode (RKN), resulting in considerable yield loss. Developing crop resistance remains a key strategy for mitigating nematode infections. To investigate the genetic architecture of common bean responses to RKN (specifically, race 3 of M. incognita), we performed controlled crosses between the genotypes  IAC-Tybata and  Branquinho with contrasting resistance. The resulting segregating population (F2) of 333 individuals was genotyped using GBS (genotyping-by-sequencing). We used a phenotyping approach, already optimized in the lab, to collect trait data for a subset of 200 F2:3 families. Evaluations of egg mass (EM), root-galling index (GI), and root dry mass (RM) were conducted 30 days after RKN inoculation under greenhouse conditions, in a completely randomized design with ten replicates. Linkage and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping were performed, while functional mapping of associated regions facilitated identification of candidate genes. A linkage map encompassing 954 SNPs assigned to 11 linkage groups totaling 1,687 cM formed the basis for Interval Mapping (IM), Composite Interval Mapping (CIM), and Multiple Interval Mapping (MIM), revealing four major QTLs (on Pv03, Pv05, Pv08, and Pv10) and epistasis between QTL on Pv08 and on Pv10 associated with the GI trait. No significant QTL were identified for EM and RM. The model enabled calculation of genotypic values through marker-assisted selection (MAS). The high correlation between observed and predicted values (0.72) underscores the models significance. Candidate genes previously associated with nematode resistance were also identified within the QTL interval on chromosome Pv10. Our results will be valuable for future selection of varieties resistant to this important crop disease."
"Regulation of cell division orientation is a fundamental process critical to differentiation and tissue homeostasis. Microtubules emanating from the mitotic spindle pole bind a conserved complex of proteins at the cell cortex which orients the spindle and ultimately the cell division plane. Control of spindle orientation is of particular importance in developing tissues, such as the developing brain. Misorientation of the mitotic spindle and thus subsequent division plane misalignment can contribute to improper segregation of cell fate determinants in developing neuroblasts, leading to a rare neurological disorder known as microcephaly. We demonstrate that the nuclear transport protein importin , when palmitoylated, plays a critical role in mitotic spindle orientation through localizing factors, such as NuMA, to the cell cortex. We also observe craniofacial developmental defects in Xenopus laevis when importin  palmitoylation is abrogated, including smaller head and brains, a hallmark of spindle misorientation and microcephaly. These findings characterize not only a role for importin  in spindle orientation, but also a broader role for importin  palmitoylation which has significance for many cellular processes."
"Over the past decade, Immuno-Oncology has largely focused on blocking inhibitory surface receptors like PD-1 to enhance T cell anti-tumor activity. However, intracellular immune checkpoints such as CISH, which function independently of tumor-expressed ligands, offer powerful and previously untapped therapeutic potential. As a downstream regulator of TCR signaling, CISH controls T cell activation, expansion, and neoantigen reactivity. Though historically considered undruggable, recent advances in CRISPR engineering have enabled functional interrogation of these targets. We demonstrate that CISH deletion enhances T cell activation and anti-cancer functions more effectively than other emerging intracellular checkpoints. In CAR-T cells, CISH inactivation significantly increased sensitivity to tumor antigen, enabling robust recognition and killing even at low antigen levels, conditions that often lead to treatment failure with conventional T cell therapies, mirroring antigen escape scenarios seen in solid tumors. Our findings further validate CISH as a potent and druggable intracellular checkpoint capable of boosting anti-tumor T cell responses across diverse cancer types, independent of PD-L1 status. The underlying mechanisms of CISH inhibition may help explain the positive outcomes reported in recent clinical studies of this approach in solid tumor immunotherapy."
"AbstractEvidence accumulation is a fundamental neural computation essential for adaptive behavior, yet its synaptic implementation remains unclear. Addressing this challenge critically depends on linking neural dynamics to circuit structure within the same brain. Here, we combine functional calcium imaging with large-scale ultrastructural electron microscopy (EM) to uncover the wiring logic of visual evidence accumulation in larval zebrafish. In a functionally imaged EM dataset of the anterior hindbrain, we identify conserved morphological cell types whose activity patterns define distinct computational roles. Bilateral inhibition, disinhibition, and recurrent connectivity emerge as key circuit motifs shaping these dynamics. To generalize our findings across animals, we develop a photoconversion-based pipeline to label and reconstruct functionally characterized neurons, enabling us to train a classifier that predicts functional identity from morphology alone. Applying this classifier to a second, whole-brain EM dataset lacking functional data reveals matching connectivity patterns, significantly augmenting its applicability for detailed circuit dissections. Based on these results, we develop and constrain a biophysically realistic neural network model that captures observed dynamics and yields predictions we tested and confirmed experimentally. Our work illustrates how hypothesis-driven connectomics can uncover the synaptic basis of sensory-motor computations and establishes a novel framework for cross-animal circuit dissection in the vertebrate brain."
"INTRODUCTIONIncreased white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) have been reported in genetic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in small studies, but the sequence of WMH abnormalities relative to other biomarkers is unclear.

METHODSUsing a large dataset (n=763 GENFI2 participants), we measured WMHs and examined them across genetic FTD variants and stages. Cortical and subcortical volumes were parcellated, and serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels were measured. Biomarker progression was assessed with discriminative event-based and regression modeling.

RESULTSSymptomatic GRN carriers showed elevated WMHs, primarily in the frontal lobe, while no significant increase was observed in C9orf72 or MAPT carriers. WMH abnormalities preceded NfL elevation, ventricular enlargement, and cortical atrophy. Longitudinally, baseline WMHs predicted subcortical changes, while subcortical volumes did not predict WMH changes, suggesting WMHs may precede neurodegeneration.

DISCUSSIONWMHs are elevated in a subset of GRN-related FTD. When present, they appear early and should be considered in disease progression models.

HighlightsO_LIElevated WMH volumes in symptomatic GRN carriers, but not in other mutations.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSSystematic reviewC_ST_ABSWe systematically reviewed the literature on white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) using PubMed. While a few small studies reported increased WMHs in GRN mutation carriers, their sample sizes were limited, and they did not assess the timing of WMHs within disease progression or their temporal relationship to other biomarkers.

InterpretationWe identified a sequence of key biomarkers in GRN-related FTD and demonstrated that WMHs are among the earliest biomarkers, preceding cortical and subcortical atrophy as well as blood biomarkers. This aligns with neuropathological evidence of early white matter involvement in FTLD-GRN. Additionally, using a larger dataset, we validated previous reports of elevated WMHs in GRN carriers, confirming their reliability.

Future directionsFuture studies should integrate WMHs into FTD progression models to enhance early diagnosis. Understanding why only a subset of GRN carriers exhibit high WMH volumes remains a key research priority."
"Kinesin-1 microtubule motors are ATP-fuelled, twin-headed cargo transporters that step processively along microtubules, with a load-dependent directional bias. Here we show using single molecule optical trapping that 1 mM ATP{gamma}S, a slowly-hydrolysed analogue, substantially defeats the biasing mechanism, whereas 1 {micro}M ATP{gamma}S supports it. Our data argue that kinesin re-registers itself between steps into an Await-Isomerisation (AI) state that engenders both on-axis steps and off-axis missteps, and that missteps can be rescued. In the AI state, ATP or ATP{gamma}S is bound but neck-linker docking and nucleotide hydrolysis are inhibited. Load-dependent exit from the AI state establishes hydrolytic competence via catalytic site closure and coupled neck-linker docking, which guides the tethered head to its next on-axis site. By overpopulating the AI state, ATP{gamma}S reveals its pivotal role in the biasing mechanism, whose control logic maximises steered diffusion-to-capture of the leading kinesin-1 head under load, at the expense of futile nucleotide turnover."
"Knowledge of species geographic distributions is essential to wildlife conservation and management. A great deal of research has developed predictive models that reveal complex spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of species occurrence probabilities. However, binary maps of the geographic limits of species occurrence (""range maps"") are still used in conservation assessments, decision making, and as a component of the species distribution modelling process itself. Organizations that create and revise range maps face numerous challenges. For example, different types of data must often be combined to fill knowledge gaps. Range delineation is labor intensive and subjective in ways that hinder transparency and repeatability. I developed a framework for transparent and repeatable range maps in support of the U.S. Geological Surveys National Gap Analysis Project. The framework has an explicit conceptual foundation that supports a compilation process built with open-source technologies and freely available data. As a case study, I mapped Fisher Pekania pennanti range and presence between 2021 and 2025 for the conterminous United States by compiling information from a range map circa 2001, 2,287 species occurrence records from 16 datasets, and 17 scientific publications. The maps depict presence and range according to levels of evidence. The justification for classification of each spatial unit is included in the output. The maps revealed that translocations and emigration have expanded the species range in some areas, but the species is suspected to be absent from some areas previously considered range. The framework overcomes several challenges, but some components of the process warrant further development, such as occurrence record evaluation and direct incorporation of predictions from species distribution models. This work demonstrates how freely accessible technologies and data can support the maintenance and revision of species range datasets while improving transparency, reproducibility, and efficiency."
"Large sex hormonal fluctuations are thought to influence vaginal microbiota, but little is known about the impact of small, physiological variations. Here we tracked changes in vaginal microbiota during four key menstrual cycle phases in 61 healthy Italian women from the Women4Health cohort. The microbiota was primarily composed of Lactobacillus, with L. iners being the most abundant. Noteworthy, the high abundance of L. iners contrasts with previous studies in European populations, challenging its proposed pathogenic role, and suggesting distinct microbiota profiles within Europe. Individual microbiotas were generally stable, but beta diversity was higher during the follicular phase. Only 11 women exhibited compositional shifts and those mostly occurred between follicular and ovulatory phases. Finally, among the hormones evaluated, 17-beta estradiol had the largest impact on taxa abundance variations. Our study highlights specific features of the Italian population and points to the resilience of the vaginal microbiota to physiological hormonal changes."
"Realistic, in vivo-like synthetic data is increasingly needed to develop and validate methods in magnetic resonance spectroscopy. MRS-Sim is a powerful, open-source framework for simulating such data while providing known ground truth values. Its modularity enables modeling the complexities of MRS data for various in vivo scenarios. The underlying physical equations include both commonly used spectral components of linear-combination fitting routines and two novel components. The first is a 3D B0 field map simulator that models B0 field inhomogeneities, ranging from slight variations to severe distortions. The second is a novel semi-parametric generator that mimics signals from poorly characterized residual water regions and spectral baseline contributions. This framework can simulate scenarios ranging from raw multi-coil transients to preprocessed, coil-combined multi-average data.

Simulating realistic in vivo-like datasets requires appropriate model parameter ranges and distributions, best determined by analyzing the fitting parameters from existing in vivo data. Therefore, MRS-Sim includes tools for analyzing the ranges and statistical distributions of those parameters from in vivo datasets fitted with Osprey, allowing simulations to be tailored to specific datasets. Additionally, the accompanying repository of supplemental information assists non-expert users with general simulations of MRS data.

The modularity of this framework facilitates easy customization various in vivo scenarios and promotes continued community development. Using a single framework for diverse applications addresses the inconsistencies in current protocols. By simulating in vivo-like data, MRS-Sim supports many MRS tasks, including verifying spectral fitting protocols and conducting reproducibility analyses. Readily available synthetic data also benefits deep learning research, particularly when sufficient in vivo data is unavailable for training. Overall, MRS-Sim will promote reproducibility and make MRS research more accessible to a wider audience."
"Supergenes underlying complex trait polymorphisms ensure sets of coadapted alleles remain genetically linked. Despite their prevalence in nature, the mechanisms of supergene effects on genome regulation are poorly understood. In the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, a supergene containing over 500 individual genes influences trait variation in multiple castes to collectively underpin a colony level social polymorphism. Here, we present results of an integrative investigation of supergene effects on gene regulation. We present analyses of ATAC-seq data to investigate variation in chromatin accessibility by supergene genotype and STARR-seq data to characterize enhancer activity by supergene haplotype. Integration with gene coexpression analyses, newly mapped intact TEs, and previously identified CNVs, collectively reveal widespread effects of the supergene on chromatin structure, gene transcription, and regulatory element activity, with a genome-wide bias for open chromatin and increased expression in the presence of the derived supergene haplotype, particularly in regions that harbor intact TEs. Integrated consideration of CNVs and regulatory element divergence suggests each evolved in concert to shape the expression of supergene encoded factors, including several transcription factors that may directly contribute to the trans-regulatory footprint of a heteromorphic social chromosome. Overall, we show how genome structure in the form of a supergene has wide-reaching effects on gene regulation and gene expression."
"IntroductionHigher brain-predicted age gaps (BAG), based on anatomical brain scans, have been associated with cognitive decline among elderly participants. Adding a cerebrovascular component, in the form of arterial spin labelling (ASL) perfusion MRI, can improve the BAG predictions and potentially increase sensitivity to cardiovascular health, a contributor to brain ageing and cognitive decline. ASL acquisition differences are likely to influence brain age estimations, and data harmonisation becomes indispensable for multi-cohort brain age studies including ASL. In this multi-cohort, multi-sequence study, we investigate harmonisation methods to improve the generalisability of cerebrovascular brain age.

MethodsA multi-study dataset of 2608 participants was used, comprising structural T1-weighted (T1w), FLAIR, and ASL 3T MRI data. The single scanner training dataset consisted of 806 healthy participants, age 50{+/-}17, 18-95 years. The testing datasets comprised four cohorts (n=1802, age 67{+/-}8, 37-90 years). Image features included grey and white matter (GM/WM) volumes (T1w), WM hyperintensity volumes and counts (FLAIR), and ASL cerebral blood flow (CBF) and its spatial coefficient of variation (sCoV). Feature harmonisation was performed using NeuroComBat, CovBat, NeuroHarmonize, OPNested ComBat, AutoComBat, and RELIEF. ASL-only and T1w+FLAIR+ASL brain age models were trained using ExtraTrees. Model performance was assessed through the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean BAG.

ResultsASL feature differences between cohorts decreased after harmonisation for all methods (p<0.05), mostly for RELIEF. Negative associations between age and GM CBF (b=-0.37, R2=0.13, unharmonised) increased after harmonisation for all methods (b<-0.42, R2>0.12) but weakened for RELIEF (b=-0.28, R2=0.14). In the ASL-only model, MAE improved for all harmonisation methods from 11.1{+/-}7.5 years to less than 8.8{+/-}6.2 years (p<0.001), while BAGs changed from 0.6{+/-}13.4 years to less than -1.03{+/-}7.92 years (p<0.001).

For T1w+FLAIR+ASL, MAE (5.9{+/-}4.6 years, unharmonised) increased for all harmonisation methods non-significantly to above 6.0{+/-}4.9 years (p>0.42) and significantly for RELIEF (6.4{+/-}5.2 years, p=0.02), while BAGs non-significantly differed from -1.6{+/-}7.3 years to between -1.3{+/-}4.7 and -2.0{+/-}8.0 years (p>0.82). In general, the ASL-specific parameter harmonisation method AutoComBat performed nominally best.

DiscussionHarmonisation of ASL features improves feature consistency between studies and also improves brain age estimations when only ASL features are used. ASL-specific parameter harmonisation methods perform nominally better than basic mean and scale adjustment or latent-factor approaches, suggesting that ASL acquisition parameters should be considered when harmonising ASL data. Although multi-modal brain age estimations were improved less by ASL-only harmonisation, possibly due to weaker associations between age and ASL features compared to T1w features feature importance, studies investigating pathological ASL-feature distributions might still benefit from harmonisation. These findings advocate for ASL-parameter specific harmonisation to explore associations between cardiovascular risk factors, brain ageing, and cognitive decline using multi-cohort ASL and cerebrovascular brain age studies."
"Bacterial identification, antimicrobial resistance prediction, and strain typification are critical tasks in clinical microbiology, essential for guiding patient treatment and controlling the spread of infectious diseases. While Machine Learning (ML) has shown immense promise in enhancing MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry applications for these tasks, an up to date comprehensive review from a ML perspective is currently lacking. To address this gap, we systematically reviewed 93 studies published between 2004 and 2024, focusing on key ML aspects such as data size and balance, pre-processing pipelines, model selection and evaluation, open-source data and code availability. Our analysis highlights the predominant use of classical ML models like Random Forest and Support Vector Machines, alongside emerging interest in Deep Learning approaches for handling complex, high-dimensional data. Despite significant progress, challenges such as inconsistent preprocessing workflows, reliance on black-box models, limited external validation, and insufficient open-source resources persist, hindering transparency, reproducibility, and broader adoption. This review offers actionable insights to enhance ML-driven bacterial diagnostics, advocating for standardized methodologies, greater transparency, and improved data accessibility. In addition, we provide guidelines on how to approach ML for MALDI-TOF analysis, helping researchers navigate key decisions in model development and evaluation."
"Identifying genes associated with rare diseases remains challenging due to the scarcity of patients and the limited statistical power of traditional association methods. Here, we introduce PERADIGM (Phenotype Embedding similarity-based RAre DIsease Gene Mapping), a novel framework that leverages natural language processing techniques to integrate comprehensive phenotype information from electronic health records for rare disease gene discovery. PERADIGM employs an embedding model to capture relationships between ICD-10 codes, providing a nuanced representation of individual phenotypes. By utilizing patient similarity scores, it enhances the identification of candidate genes associated with disease-specific phenotypes, surpassing conventional methods that rely on binary disease status. We applied PERADIGM to the UK Biobank dataset for three rare diseases: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), Marfan syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). PERADIGM identified additional candidate genes associated with ADPKD-related and Marfan syndrome-related phenotypes, some of which are supported by existing literature, and demonstrated enhanced signal detection for NF1-specific phenotypes beyond traditional methods. Our findings demonstrate the potential of PERADIGM to identify genes associated with rare diseases and related phenotypes by incorporating phenotype embeddings and patient similarity, providing a powerful tool for precision medicine and a deeper understanding of rare disease genetics and clinical manifestations."
"BackgroundEnteric glial cells (EGC) play a crucial role in maintaining gut homeostasis, but their dysregulation in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) remains poorly understood. Emerging preclinical data suggests activated EGC have beneficial roles in controlling gut pathophysiology.

ObjectiveUnderstanding EGC activation and adaptation during experimental and clinical IBD.

DesignWe provide the first highly integrated approach to identify EGC activation signature in IBD. Profiling 390 samples from IBD patients via bulk and single-nucleus (sn) transcriptomics and replicate the findings on publicly available bulk and single-cell (sc) datasets from 1160 patients and 19,000 single EGC. Preclinical modelling of Th1/Th17 inflammation, reporter-assisted EGC sorting, analysis of regulated cell death, and Casp8 ablation in EGC was performed

ResultsWe identified novel IBD type and sampling associated EGC activation signature. Specific EGC activation markers were shared in biopsies and resection specimens, and were divergent between Crohns disease and Ulcerative colitis. Preclinical modelling of intestinal inflammation identified combinatorial TNF and IFN-{gamma}-driven activation of EGC, associated with elevated necroptosis, and negatively impacting gut motility. Genetic-reporter-enabled sorting and downstream analyses confirmed TNF and IFN-{gamma}-driven EGC necroptosis, potentiated by Casp8 deficiency. Furthermore, snRNA-Seq from IBD patient samples confirmed elevated cell death signature in activated but not in rare neuroglia progenitor-like cluster.

ConclusionOur findings identify IBD type-associated activated EGC markers involved in immune and epithelial homeoastasis. We uncover necroptosis of activated EGCs as a constituent of intestinal inflammation. Advancing our understanding of activated EGC survival is pivotal in elucidating their complex roles in maintaining gut immune-epithelial homeostasis.

What is already known on this topicActivated EGC have emerged as important contributors in maintaining epithelial, immune and neuronal homeostasis. Increasing evidence from mouse studies points to the role of activated EGC in epithelial regeneration, tolerogenic T-cell activation, relaying psychological stress to the enteric nervous system, post-injury neurogenesis, and helminth clearance. Nevertheless, no consensus has emerged on what might define activated EGC in the context of IBD and how EGC turnover is affected in gut inflammation, limiting translation of their disease associated roles.

What this study addsBy combining bulk with single cell and single nucleus transcriptomes from IBD patients we identified new IBD type- and location-associated EGC activation signatures. Some of these are conserved with mouse EGC in gut inflammation models. We identified osteopontin an immunomodulator and Wnt6 an epithelial morphogen elevated in IBD EGC. We also identified IBD-associated EGC cell clusters, which display higher expression of cell death pathway transcripts. To investigate EGC turnover, we utilized preclinical models and found rapid EGC activation upon Th1/Th17 inflammation. This was associated with elevated EGC activation and caspase-independent necroptotic cell death. Ex vivo experiments showed a combinatorial requirement of IFN-{gamma} and TNF in mediating EGC necroptosis. Our findings were replicated on multiple publicly available sc-RNA sequencing datasets from IBD patients.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyExpanding on the available repertoire of EGC activation markers in IBD, both shared and unique to sampling procedure, disease type, and location will provide researchers with tools to identify EGC homeostasis during IBD. Moreover, the nature of the identified markers will stimulate research into specific EGC pathways triggered in inflammation. Adding to this, the rapid induction in pathological death of activated but not naive EGC upon IFN-{gamma} and TNF stimulation will shed light on EGC adaptation and turnover. Our identification of markers of activated EGC with immuno-modulatory and epithelial-regenerative properties, including osteopontin and wingless family of morphogenes will stimulate further research in EGC-immune and EGC-epithelial communication in the context of IBD."
"The poroelastic properties of tissues regulate molecular transport and mechanical signaling, yet their evolution during aging remains poorly understood. In particular, senescent fibroblasts accumulate in aged tissues, contributing to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, but their impact on tissue mechanics and permeability is unclear. In this study, we developed a microfluidic-based in vitro model to assess the poroelastic properties of collagen gels embedded with senescent fibroblasts over time. Our approach integrates periodic pressure actuation with real-time pressure monitoring in a sealed air cavity, enabling the detection of fluid permeation and solid matrix deformations. We analyze our data using analytical and numerical models based on a porohyperelastic framework. This framework combines compressible Neo-Hookean elasticity with the Kozeny-Carman permeability relationship. We demonstrate that senescent fibroblasts induce a progressive softening of the ECM without altering its permeability. Immunostaining reveals that this softening correlates with structural reorganization of the collagen network, characterized by increased branching and network remodeling. Our findings provide insights into the biomechanical effects of senescent fibroblasts on ECM homeostasis. We further argue that our platform offers a unique solution to investigate ECM remodeling not only in aging but also fibrosis, cancer progression, or regenerative medicine strategies."
"Species belonging to the genus Argulus are globally distributed fish parasites. Their veterinary significance primarily lies in their disruptive presence and their role as mechanical vectors. Although Argulus japonicus Thiele, 1900 is a widely distributed representative of this genus that feeds on freshwater fish, only Argulus foliaceus (Linnaeus, 1758) had previously been reported in Hungary. The aim of this study was to investigate the fish louse fauna in a local common carp (Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758) population. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the occurrence of A. japonicus in Hungary. Our detailed molecular analyses, including the complete mitochondrial genome, revealed for the first time that the A. japonicus specimens found in Hungary differ significantly from their Far Eastern counterparts. Furthermore, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) sequence analysis -- a region known to be stable within the species -- showed that while our sequences were nearly identical to those of other European specimens, they differed markedly from the available Asian isolates. The phylogenetic analysis also confirmed this divergence. The European A. japonicus sequences form a clearly distinct sister group to the Asian lineages. In light of these findings, and based on thorough morphological examinations, the authors propose that the specimens found in Hungary represent a new subspecies, Argulus japonicus subsp. europaeus subsp. nov. Keve, 2025."
"Emerging evidence suggests that nitrous oxide (N2O), a gaseous NMDA receptor antagonist and dissociative anesthetic, exerts rapid antidepressant effects akin to subanesthetic ketamine. However, its cellular, molecular, and behavioral effects remain poorly understood. Using in vivo two-photon imaging through cortical microprisms, we demonstrate that 50% N2O/O2 rapidly increases neuronal calcium activity in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). This was corroborated by elevated c-Fos expression at both protein and mRNA levels in mPFC lysates. Cortical EEG recordings revealed that N2O increased subsequent wake-associated gamma oscillations and enhanced slow-wave activity during sleep, suggestive of cortical activation and synaptic potentiation. In a chronic corticosterone stress model, N2O elicited antidepressant-like behavioral effects in several, though not all, domains. Together, these findings indicate that a single treatment with N2O rapidly enhances cortical activity, modulates sleep and wake EEG oscillations, and produces antidepressant-like effects, paralleling key actions associated with subanesthetic ketamine."
"Combinatorial control by transcription factors (TFs) is central to eukaryotic gene regulation, yet its mechanism, evolution, and regulatory impact are not well understood. Here we use natural variation in the yeast phosphate starvation (PHO) response to examine the genetic basis and species variation in TF interdependence. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, main TF Pho4 relies on the co-TF Pho2 to regulate [~]28 genes, whereas in the related pathogen Candida glabrata, Pho4 has reduced Pho2 dependence and regulates [~]70 genes. We found C. glabrata Pho4 (CgPho4) binds the same motif with 3-4 fold higher affinity. Machine learning and yeast one-hybrid assay identify two intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in CgPho4 that boost its activation domains activity. In ScPho4, an IDR next to the DNA binding domain both allows for enhanced activity with Pho2 and inhibits activity without Pho2. This study reveals how IDR divergence drives TF interdependence evolution by influencing activation potential and autoinhibition."
"Cancer is a major global health threat, and early detection of cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes. DNA methylation in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has emerged as a promising biomarker for non-invasive cancer diagnosis. However, the integration and utilization of existing cfDNA methylation data have been limited, hindering comprehensive research efforts, especially in the discovery of cfDNA methylation biomarkers. To address this challenge, we introduce cfMethDB, a comprehensive database dedicated to cfDNA methylation in cancer that encompasses 4828 publicly available datasets. Through standardized analysis, we identified 1,048,770 differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) as candidate biomarkers across seven cancer types. With cfMethDB, we not only identified known cfDNA methylation biomarkers, but also discovered several genes, such as ZIC4, that could be novel biomarkers. Moreover, cfMethDB offers a suite of user-friendly tools, including biomarker evaluation, pan-cancer search and end motif analysis. We hope that cfMethDB will serve as a valuable platform for the discovery of novel cancer cfDNA methylation biomarkers and will facilitate cancer research and clinical applications. cfMethDB is publicly available at: https://cfmethdb.hzau.edu.cn/home."
"The ability to maintain invariant developmental phenotypes across disparate environments is termed canalization, but few examples of canalization mechanisms are described. In plants, robust flower production across environmental gradients contributes to reproductive success and agricultural yields. Flowers are produced by the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in an auxin-dependent manner following the switch from vegetative growth to the reproductive phase. While the timing of this phase change, called the floral transition, is sensitized to numerous environmental and endogenous signals, flower formation itself is remarkably invariant across environmental conditions. Previously we found that CLAVATA peptide signaling promotes auxin-dependent flower primordia formation in cool environments, but that high temperatures can restore primordia formation through unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that heat promotes floral primordia patterning and formation in SAMs not by increased auxin production, but through the production of the mobile flowering signal, florigen, in leaves. Florigen, which includes FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and its paralog TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) in Arabidopsis thaliana, is necessary and sufficient to buffer flower production against the loss of CLAVATA signaling and promotes heat-mediated primordia formation through specific SAM expressed transcriptional regulators. We find that sustained florigen production is necessary for continuous flower primordia production at warmer temperatures, contrasting florigens switch-like control of floral transition. Lastly, we show that CLAVATA signaling and florigen synergize to canalize flower production across broad temperature ranges. This work sheds light on the mechanisms governing the canalization of plant development and provides potential targets for engineering crop plants with improved thermal tolerances."
"Cerebral organoids (COs) are multicellular, self-organized, in vitro, 3D brain-like tissues used for developmental biology, disease modelling and drug screening. However, their lack of vascularity renders them less physiologically accurate. Vascularization of COs remains challenging due to the different requirements between COs and vascular cells, limited vascular network penetration within the organoid, and the absence of luminal perfusion. Here, we devised an encapsulation approach in which human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVECs) were delivered to developing COs from progressively degrading extracellular matrix (ECM)-based hydrogel droplets. By tuning this hydrogel concentration and media composition, we observed enhanced vascular-like network formation that expanded within the organoid tissue. Using pathway inhibitors, we showed that a subset of the endothelial cells (ECs) originated from the CO itself, promoting network integration. Endothelial networks displayed blood-brain barrier (BBB) features, including astrocytic end-footlike interactions, pericyte wrapping, and collagen-laminin basal lamina. Vascularized COs exhibited greater media internalization and up to three-fold lower apoptosis than non-vascularized COs. This comprehensive 3D neurovascular model is a promising platform for cerebrovascular research and drug testing applications.

"Children living with perinatally acquired HIV (CPHIV) demonstrate hearing impairments and language processing delays even in the presence of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Even though efficient processing of sound relies on the proper function of both the peripheral and central auditory auditory systems (PAS; CAS), investigations on the effect of HIV on the auditory system have predominantly focused on the PAS. Additionally, language processing requires the efficient interaction between CAS brain regions and non-auditory regions. Investigating the functional connectivity (FC) within the CAS and between the CAS and non-auditory regions may reveal the influence of HIV on regions involved in auditory function.

Within a Bayesian stastical framework, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) to map FC in the CAS as well as between CAS regions and non-auditory regions of 11-year-old CPHIV. Graph theory was used to investigate the regional effects of HIV on functional brain network properties. Finally we explored the relationships between FC and neurocognitive outcomes relating to auditory and language processing. We hypothesized that CPHIV would show disruptions in FC between CAS regions as well as between CAS and non-auditroy regions. Secondly, we hypothesized that in CPHIV, regional brain network properties would be altered compared to their uninfected peers (CHUU). Finally we hypothesized that FC and functional network regional outcomes would be related to neurocognitive outcomes.

Our investigation revealed lower FC of the primary auditory cortex (PAC) in CPHIV as well as disruptions in FC between CAS regions (including the PAC) and non-auditry regions including hippocampal sub-regions, the lingual gyri and basal ganglia. Functional network analysis reavealed lower nodal degree and efficiency in CAS regions including the cochlear nucleus/superior olivary complex (CN/SOC) and the inferior colliculus (IC). We also report associations between the nodal efficiency of middle temporal and superior frontal regions and delayed recall, a neurocognitive marker of working memory, present in CHUU but not in CPHIV.

Our results demonstrate FC alterations in the PAC and between CAS regions and non-auditory regions involved in limbic, visual and motor processing, as well as disruptions to the regional properties of the CAS regions as part of the functional brain network. These results provide insight into the state of the CAS FC in the presence of HIV and its possible role in the hearing and language impairments seen in this population."
"There is a pressing need for the development, characterization, and standardization of animal models of Parkinsons disease (PD) that properly mimic the cardinal features of this disorder, comprising both the motor phenotype and neuropathological signatures. In the past few years, animal modeling has moved from neurotoxin-based approaches toward viral vectors carrying a given genetic payload of interest. Here, to induce pigmentation of the mouse brain upon systemic delivery, we took advantage of a modified adeno-associated viral vector capsid engineered to bypass the blood-brain barrier and coding for the human tyrosinase gene (AAV9-P31-hTyr). Obtained results revealed an ongoing pigmentation of catecholaminergic centers related to the pathophysiology of PD, such as the substantia nigra pars compacta, ventral tegmental area, and locus coeruleus. Moreover, pigmented dopaminergic neurons exhibited Lewy body-like intracytoplasmic inclusions, a progressive nigrostriatal degeneration, and a time-dependent PD motor phenotype. The bilateral pigmented mouse model of PD generated this way is highly reproducible, does not require stereotaxic surgery for viral vector deliveries, and opens unprecedented possibilities for preclinical testing of therapeutic candidates designed to reduce disease progression rates."
"Identifying target-specific drugs remains a challenge in pharmacology, especially for highly homologous proteins such as dopamine receptors D2R and D3R. Differences in target-specific cryptic druggable sites for such receptors arise from the distinct conformational ensembles underlying their dynamic behavior. While Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting protein dynamics, the sheer volume of MD data requires scalable and unbiased data analysis strategies to pinpoint residue communities regulating conformational state ensembles. We have developed the Dynamically Resolved Universal Model for BayEsiAn network Tracking (DRUMBEAT) interpretable machine learning algorithm and validated it by identifying residue communities that enable the deactivation of the {beta}2-adrenergic receptor. Further, upon analyzing dopamine receptor dynamics we identified distinct and non-conserved residue communities around the contacts F1704.62_F172ECL2 and S1464.38_G14134.56 that are specific to D3R conformational transitions compared to D2R. This information can be tapped to design subtype-specific drugs for neuropsychiatric and substance use disorders."
"Primary human pancreatic ductal organoids (HPDO) have emerged as a model to study pancreas biology and disease. Yet, donor material availability, and a lack of extensive benchmarking limits the range of applications. To address this gap, we established porcine pancreatic ductal organoids (PPDO) as a system from an easily obtainable source to model pancreatic ductal/progenitor biology. We benchmarked PPDO to HPDO and primary porcine pancreas using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). We observed no overt phenotypic differences in PPDO derived from distinct developmental stages, with a WNT signaling enriched population characterizing PPDO. PPDO exhibited differentiation potential towards mature ductal cells and limited potential towards endocrine lineages. We used PPDO as a platform to assess the safety of FDA-approved drugs and showed conserved toxicity of statins and -adrenergic receptor inhibitors between PPDO and HPDO cultures. Overall, our results highlight the PPDO as a model for mammalian duct/progenitor applications."
"Generative protein language models (PLMs) are powerful tools for designing proteins purpose-built to solve problems in medicine, agriculture, and industrial processes. Recent work has trained ever larger language models, but there has been little systematic study of the optimal training distributions and the influence of model scale on the sequences generated by PLMs. We introduce the ProGen3 family of sparse generative PLMs, and we develop compute-optimal scaling laws to scale up to a 46B-parameter model pre-trained on 1.5T amino acid tokens. ProGen3s pre-training data is sampled from an optimized data distribution over the Profluent Protein Atlas v1, a carefully curated dataset of 3.4B full-length proteins. We evaluate for the first time in the wet lab the influence of model scale on the sequences generated by PLMs, and we find that larger models generate viable proteins for a much wider diversity of protein families. Finally, we find both computationally and experimentally that larger models are more responsive to alignment with laboratory data, resulting in improved protein fitness prediction and sequence generation capabilities. These results indicate that larger PLMs like ProGen3-46B trained on larger, well-curated datasets are powerful foundation models that push the frontier of protein design.1"
"Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) help identify disease causing genes, but often fail to pinpoint disease mechanisms at the cellular level because of the limited sample sizes and sparsity of cell-type-specific expression data. Here we propose scPrediXcan which integrates state-of-the-art deep learning approaches that predict epigenetic features from DNA sequences with the canonical TWAS framework. Our prediction approach, ctPred, predicts cell-type-specific expression with high accuracy and captures complex gene regulatory grammar that linear models overlook. Applied to type 2 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus, scPrediXcan outperformed the canonical TWAS framework by identifying more candidate causal genes, explaining more genome-wide association studies (GWAS) loci, and providing insights into the cellular specificity of TWAS hits. Overall, our results demonstrate that scPrediXcan represents a significant advance, promising to deepen our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying complex diseases."
"Inhalation of dust is significant and relevant to health effects. As pollution and climate change worsen in dryland regions, wind currents entrain loose sediment and dust. This potentially disperses toxic geochemical and microbial burdens throughout the region. When inhaled environmental dust and host-associated microbiomes mingle, they pose exposure risks to host respiratory health. The Salton Sea, Californias largest lake, is shrinking thus exposing nearby communities to playa dust. Therefore, we analyze the effect of Salton Sea dust exposure in murine models to relate lung microbial communities and respiratory health. We used an environmental chamber to expose mice to dust filtrate or ambient air and examined the effects of those exposures on lung microbiomes. We found that lung microbial composition varied by dust exposure. Furthermore, dust elicited neutrophil recruitment and immune responses more than mice exposed to ambient air. Sources of dust differentially affected the composition of the lung core microbiome. Lung microbial diversity correlated with neutrophil recruitment as lungs associated with inflammatory responses harbored more diverse microbiomes. Although Salton Sea dust influences dust microbiomes and prevalent taxa, these responses were variable. The composition of lungs exposed to dust collected further from the Sea was more similar to lungs from ambient air exposures; in contrast, dust collected near the Sea yielded lung microbiomes that clustered further from lungs exposed to ambient air. As lakes continue to dry out, we expect greater public health risks in proximal dryland regions, which may correlate with dust microbial dispersal-related changes to lung microbiomes.

ImportanceDust inhalation can lead to health effects, especially when toxic chemicals and microbes mix in with the dust particles. As Californias Salton Sea dries up, it exposes lake bottom sediments to wind, which disperses the dried sediments. To mimic the effect of inhaling Salton Sea dust, we collected and filtered airborne dust to use in exposure experiments with mice in environmental chambers. We predicted that inhaling small dust particles, chemicals, and microbial residues found in this dust would affect mouse respiratory health, or change the microbes found inside their lungs. We found that inhaling dust led to lung inflammation and the dust source influenced the type of microbes found inside mouse lungs. As lakes continue to dry out, we expect greater health risks and changes to lung microbiomes.

"1.The gene SLC6A15 encodes the protein B0AT2, a transporter for neutral amino acids. It is highly expressed in the brain and has been associated with depression but little is otherwise know about its function. In this study, we identified the first inhibitors of this protein to pharmacologically investigate its function.

The transporter activity was evaluated using a cellular uptake of the substrate 3H-proline. A miniaturized assay was developed and used for a High Throughput Screening (HTS) of 200,000 compounds. Hits were tested for cell toxicity and selectivity versus related transporters of the SLC6 family. The most promising inhibitors were validated by proline uptake and neurite outgrowth in primary hippocampal neurons.

Of the 10 chemical scaffolds identified, a 1,5-benzodiazepine series had the most promising selectivity and structure-activity relationship (SAR) profile. The best compounds showed drug-like properties and inhibited B0AT2 with an IC50 of 250 nM both in SLC6A15-overexpressing HEK293 cells and primary neurons, with no detectable inhibition (> 80{micro}M) of SERT, DAT, GAT1, or NTT4/SLC6A17. These compounds also dose-dependently stimulated neurite outgrowth in primary neurons.

The identified compounds are the first inhibitors of the amino acids transporter B0AT2/SLC6A15. Their potency, selectivity and physicochemical properties allow to target the transporter in relevant biological systems and to initiate new studies to understand its role and implication in diseases."
"Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are required for the uneven distribution of lipids between cellular membranes, which is essential for many cell functions. In yeast, Osh6 is an LTP that exchanges phosphatidylserine (PS) with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane (PM), promoting the enrichment of PS in the PM. Here, we address why, to function optimally, Osh6 must bind to Ist2, an ER-resident lipid scramblase able to connect the ER to the PM via an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). We determined in vitro that Osh6 binds to the Ist2 IDR with micromolar affinity, whether empty or bound to its lipid ligands. Moreover, we found that Osh6 efficiently transfers PS at ER-PM contact sites if the Ist2 IDR has a minimal length and its binding site in the IDR is sufficiently removed from the ER surface. Next, we reconstituted the Osh6:Ist2 complex within artificial ER-PM contact sites and demonstrated that the association of Osh6 with Ist2 allows for a fast and directed PS flux between the connected membranes. We identified the Ist2 binding site on the Osh6 surface by validating structural models using our functional assays. Finally, we found that the Osh6-mediated PS transfer can be coupled to the PS scramblase activity of Ist2. These data unveil new functional partnerships between an LTP and a membrane tethering/scramblase protein and point to the general advantage of localizing these processes to membrane contact sites to ensure their efficiency."
"White matter (WM) connections, which facilitate communication between brain regions, substantially impact intellectual performance. However, the shared genetic underpinnings of WM connections and intelligence remain unclear. In the present study, we first conducted genome-wide association studies on the global and regional topological properties of WM connectomes constructed from diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of 26,655 participants from the UK Biobank. Forty-one independent significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with global WM connectome efficiency and 45 SNPs linked to nodal efficiency for 246 brain regions were identified. Then, regional heterogeneity was demonstrated for the genetic correlations between WM connectome efficiency and intelligence. The nodal efficiency of 128 regions with nominally significant genetic correlations with intelligence was determined. Among these, 44 regions and 3 regions shared SNPs with intelligence within the chromosome 6q21 and 3p21.1 locus respectively, and significant causal effects on intelligence were found for 63 regions, mainly in the orbital gyrus and superior frontal gyrus. Finally, we found that the integration of polygenetic score and WM connectome efficiency data was more accurate for predicting individual intelligence than the use of a single data type. These findings improve our understanding of how genes shape the individual WM connectome and intelligence and the relationship between WM connectomes and intelligence."
"In humans and other social mammals, more socially connected females often have higher fitness. Yet evidence linking female sociality to offspring survival remains inconsistent, and is limited to a handful of primate species in which females depend on close female kin for social status. Here we examine the relationship between female social integration and offspring survival in eastern chimpanzees. We find that females that were more socially integrated with other females in the year before giving birth had higher offspring survival to age 1 (the period of highest mortality) and age 5 (the approximate age of weaning). Furthermore, social integration remained a strong predictor of offspring survival among females without close female kin. Our results thus add to a small set of studies linking sociality with offspring survival, here in the dispersing sex. As in humans, more socially connected female chimpanzees have higher offspring survival, despite primarily residing with non-kin."
"Pyrethroid insecticides represent a broad class of chemicals used widely in agriculture and household applications. Human studies show mixed effects of maternal pyrethroid exposure on fetal growth and neurodevelopment. Assessment of shared pyrethroid metabolites as a biomarker for exposure obscures effects of specific chemicals within this broader class. To better characterize pyrethroid effects on fetal development, we investigated maternal exposure to permethrin, a type I pyrethroid, and -cypermethrin, a type II pyrethroid, on fetal development in mice. Pregnant CD1 mice were exposed to permethrin (1.5, 15, or 50 mg/kg), -cypermethrin (0.3, 3, or 10 mg/kg), or corn oil vehicle via oral gavage on gestational days (GD) 6-16. Effects on fetal growth, placental toxicity, and neurodevelopment were evaluated at GD 16. Cypermethrin, but not permethrin, significantly reduced fetal growth and altered placental layer morphology. Placental RNAseq analysis revealed downregulation of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling in response to -cypermethrin. Both pyrethroids induced shifts in fetal dorsal forebrain microglia morphology from ramified to ameboid states; however, effects of -cypermethrin were more pronounced. The -cypermethrin transcriptome of fetal dorsal forebrain implicated altered glutamate receptor signaling, synaptogenesis, and c-AMP signaling. Coregulated gene modules in individual placenta and fetal dorsal forebrain pairs were correlated and overlapped in biological processes characterizing synapses, mitotic cell cycle, and chromatin organization, suggesting placenta-fetal brain shared mechanisms with -cypermethrin exposure. In summary, maternal type II pyrethroid -cypermethrin exposure but not type I pyrethroid permethrin significantly affected placental development, fetal growth, and neurodevelopment, and these effects were linked."
"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a frequent cause of chronic opportunistic infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is a highly diverse and adaptable Gram-negative bacterium that thrives in many environments. It is well recognised that P. aeruginosa adapts over time of colonisation to facilitate chronic infection including loss of virulence factors, however proteomic analyses of the adaptation to chronic infection have been limited. We previously collated and characterised an international panel of P. aeruginosa strains from different clinical presentations and geographical regions. Within this panel were three series of sequential isolates from people with CF, comprising eight strains in total which present an excellent opportunity to seek potential conserved adaptations that may be involved in driving chronic colonisation in the CF lung. We compared the proteomes of all eight strains (early versus respective late) to examine whether there were any changes in the proteomes over time of colonisation that were common to the three series of chronic P. aeruginosa infection isolates from three different patients. We identified 11 proteins that showed increased abundance in late isolates from all three patient series, many of which are reported to be involved in virulence, regulation of virulence or response to hypoxia and include cystic fibrosis inhibitory factor repressor (CifR), WspR, two two-component response regulators (PA2572 and PA3702), and transcriptional regulator (PA2551). Moreover, we identified three proteins (PA2572, PA3819 and PA5028) that showed increased abundance in all five late isolates from three people with CF. The probability of this being a random event is 5.06 x 10-53 and consequently is very strong evidence of positive selection. The increased abundance of PA2573 and PA3819 appears to improve the fitness P. aeruginosa to antibiotics and oxidative stress. Overall, despite the diversity within this species, there appear to be common mechanisms of adaptation in the cystic fibrosis lung."
"Efficient utilization of pentose sugars is critical for advancing sustainable biomanufacturing using lignocellulosic biomass. However, many potential host strains capable of consuming glucose and lignin-derived monomers are unable to utilize pentose sugars. Here, we engineered Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 for the utilization of D-xylose and L-arabinose. We first modelled different pentose utilization pathways using flux balance analysis to choose the most optimal pathway. A novel marker-free approach facilitated the seamless integration of the pentose catabolic gene clusters of the selected Weimberg pathway into the A. baylyi genome, generating strains capable of efficiently utilizing both D-xylose and L-arabinose as sole carbon sources without any additional engineering or adaptation. For D-xylose, the cells achieved the highest growth rate ({micro}=0.73 h-1) reported to date for non-native hosts engineered for pentose utilization. For L-arabinose, a growth rate of {micro}=0.35 h-1 was achieved, which also surpassed the growth rate on a native substrate of A. baylyi, glucose ({micro}=0.31 h-1). Importantly, pentose utilization occurred simultaneously with glucose utilization. We then applied metabolic flux analysis using 13C labeled xylose to reveal D-xylose metabolism in the engineered strain. To demonstrate the potential for value-added bioproduct synthesis, L-glutamate was selected as a target compound. Deletion of sucAB and gabT, and the overexpression of gdhA enabled the production of L-glutamate. With the engineered strain, a carbon yield of 34% during co-utilization with succinate and 70% via whole-cell catalysis using resting cells was achieved. This study establishes a robust platform for pentose utilization and value-added bioproduct synthesis in A. baylyi ADP1 and highlights the potential for further metabolic optimization."
"The C4 carbon concentrating pathway promotes high CO2 assimilation rates. To keep C4 photosynthesis energetically efficient, electron transport reactions and downstream biochemistry need to be carefully balanced. Here we use a combination of non-invasive measurements and metabolic profiling to study the efficiency of C4 photosynthesis in maize under two conditions that can lead to decoupling between electron transport and carbon assimilation: fluctuating light and suboptimal temperature. Measurements were performed for three fluctuating light regimes and three temperatures, providing the most detailed study to date of the interaction between fluctuating light and suboptimal temperature on the photosynthetic performance of maize, an important global crop. At room temperature, CO2 assimilation rates were decoupled from photosynthetic electron transport under fluctuating light regimes, in contrast to tight coordination observed under constant light. This decoupling was underpinned by metabolic flexibility and buffering by large pools of C4 transfer metabolites. Surprisingly, at sub-optimal temperatures, CO2 assimilation rates became more tightly coupled to photosynthetic electron transport rates under fluctuating light regimes. This appeared to be caused by strong feedback downregulation of electron transport and a stronger degree of light-saturation of CO2 assimilation at low temperature. Low temperature impacted carbon assimilation rates more strongly than metabolite pools or intercellular metabolite distribution, which could reflect negative effects on diffusional metabolite transfer through plasmodesmata. Altogether, these results show that maize is able to maintain energetic efficiency by buffering light transitions under room temperature, as well as avoid oxidative damage by strongly downregulating electron transfer under short-term exposure to low temperature.

One-sentence summaryAnalysis of maize CO2 assimilation under fluctuating light shows significant decoupling from photosynthetic electron transport at room temperature, supported by metabolic flexibility and buffering by large pools of C4 transfer metabolites, but tight coordination is restored under suboptimal temperature due to enhanced feedback regulation of electron transport and a stronger degree of light saturation of CO2 assimilation."
"Alzheimers Disease (AD) poses a significant global health challenge, being the most prominent cause of dementia with prevalence increasing as the population ages. While the majority of AD cases are late-onset (LOAD), current animal models predominantly represent the more aggressive, faster progressing early-onset AD (EOAD), limiting their ability in assessing early biomarkers and gaining deeper understanding of LOAD progression. This study explores a promising translatable model, the APOE4.TREM2 mouse, which combines the APOE4 allele and the Trem2 p.R47H mutation, both linked to increased AD risk in the human population. We performed behavioral phenotyping and measured hemodynamics in dorsal olfactory bulbs (dOB) during odor stimulation of the APOE4.TREM2 mouse line. Experimental evidence of olfactory dysfunction prior to clinical symptoms suggests the opportunity of utilizing smell testing and fMRI as tools for screening of AD, both for preclinical and clinical studies. Here we assess and confirm the translatability of the APOE4.TREM2 mouse LOAD model, reporting exacerbated anxiety, deficits in odor-based foraging and spatial memory, and exacerbated odor-evoked dOB intrinsic responses in an age-dependent manner."
"Oxygen availability is a critical environmental variable that shapes animal physiology and behavior. In larval zebrafish, acute hypoxia elicits a distinct increase in rhythmic pectoral fin movements, a behavior thought to facilitate oxygen uptake. While peripheral oxygen sensors such as neuroepithelial cells (NECs) and Merkel-like cells (MLCs) have been well characterized, the motor circuits responsible for executing this behavior remain unknown. Four distinct lower motor nerve branches in the spinal cord have been shown to innervate the pectoral fin muscles and are candidate effectors of hypoxia-induced behaviors. Here, we identify the neural pathways that transform hypoxia detection into a dedicated motor output. Using high-speed behavioral tracking, we confirm that hypoxia reliably increases pectoral fin beat frequency without affecting locomotor tail activity or visually guided swimming. Two-photon calcium imaging in Tg(ChaTa:Gal4;UAS:GCaMP6s) larvae reveals that a subset of cholinergic spinal motor neurons is selectively active during hypoxia-induced fin movements. Targeted laser ablation of pectoral fin motor nerves abolishes the response, demonstrating the necessity of descending input for this behavior. Our findings define a distributed, partially redundant motor circuit that implements a homeostatic fin response to hypoxia. By establishing a mechanistic framework for this behavior in a genetically accessible vertebrate model, this work enables future studies of oxygen sensing, sensorimotor integration, and the neural basis of homeostatic motor control."
"Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is increasingly favored for its portability and suitability for ecological paradigms, yet methodological standardization remains a challenge, especially regarding the optimal use of short-separation channels (SC) to remove systemic physiological noise. While SC signals are widely recognized for isolating extracerebral hemodynamics such as cardiac and respiratory artifacts, no consensus exists on how best to incorporate them into analysis pipelines, limiting comparability across studies. Here, we systematically investigate six SC regression strategies within a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) framework, using fNIRS data acquired from temporal and occipital cortices of 16 healthy adults during naturalistic auditory, visual, and audiovisual passive stimulation. These strategies varied in the number of SCs used, anatomical specificity, and the application of dimensionality reduction. Our results show that for oxygenated hemoglobin signals, processing data without SC regression yields uninterpretable outcomes, with widespread negative beta estimates and no detectable task-related activation, underscoring the crucial role of SC correction. Among correction methods, approaches pooling all SC signals without anatomical constraints consistently outperformed spatially constrained techniques mimicking limited SC availability. Furthermore, applying orthogonalization to the full set of SCs provided additional improvements by efficiently capturing shared systemic variance and reducing redundancy, enhancing detection of modality-specific cortical activations and condition contrasts. Finally, although the deoxygenated hemoglobin signal is inherently less sensitive to systemic noise, it benefited from the same SC regression strategies, supporting their applicability across chromophores. Overall, our findings highlight the essential role of SC regression in recovering physiologically meaningful signals in fNIRS and recommend including all available SC channels within the GLM, coupled with orthogonalization techniques, as a robust and generalizable best practice for denoising across diverse experimental designs and hardware configurations."
"Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) has been linked to various neutrophil functions, but the intracellular mechanisms underlying its modulation are unknown. Neutrophils are essential cells for host defense. Neutrophil effector functions include migration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, degranulation, and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. The goal of this study was to elucidate the signaling mechanism through which JAK2 modulates neutrophil function and the effect of aging on this pathway. We hypothesized that JAK2-mediated modulation changes the molecular mechanisms associated with neutrophil function in an age- and sex-dependent manner. Neutrophils from young (3 months) and aged (22+ months), male and female C57BL/6J mice were isolated, treated with a JAK2 inhibitor (AZD1480) or a pan-JAK inhibitor (Baricitinib), and stimulated with Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Functional assays were conducted to assess migration, ROS production, degranulation, NETosis, and metabolism. Mass spectrometry and Luminex assays provided proteomic and cytokine profiles. Our data show that JAK2 promotes migration via membrane composition and actin remodeling, with age-dependent shifts in chemokine secretion. JAK2 indirectly affects NETosis by modulating IL-1 signaling and ROS production. It also primes ROS production by altering NADPH oxidase components. In young neutrophils, JAK2 influences degranulation through actin remodeling, while aged neutrophils display impaired granule release. Metabolically, JAK2 enhances pentose phosphate pathway activity in young neutrophils and decreases glycogen breakdown in aged cells. These findings reveal mechanisms by which JAK2 modulates neutrophil function and suggest age-specific therapeutic targeting in inflammatory diseases."
"We combine Lattice Structured Illumination Microscopy (diSIM with [~]60 nm resolution), Lattice Light-sheet microscopy and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) to explore 53BP1 dynamics in Retinal Pigment Epithelial cells. 53BP1 forms liquid condensates during double-strand DNA repair, long-range DNA end-joining and heterochromatin maintenance. Our super-resolution movies reveal differences in 53BP1 foci contour: some foci are compact and stationary while others appear amorphous, dynamically changing shapes. To explore them, we developed FRAP in the Super-Resolution regime (FRAP-SR). 53BP1 foci with an amorphous loose contour display subcompartments that recover 53BP1-eGFP signals rapidly, indicating differential protein mobilities and 53BP1 functions within a single foci. In contrast, 53BP1-eGFP foci with a compact contour recover uniformly as single foci but show higher heterogeneity in 53BP1-eGFP recovery rates compared to foci that recover as multiple subcompartments. In cells released from aphidicolin, amorphous foci show faster 53BP1 recovery compared to compact foci. We discuss the conceptual implications of different 53BP1 mobilities, and how the FRAP-SR method transforms studies of dynamic 60-100 nm structures."
"Describing the relationship between activity and connectivity in neural circuits is fundamental to understanding brain function. The connectome of cortical networks is high-dimensional, whereas neuronal activity is often low-dimensional relative to the number of neurons. Consequently, only a small fraction of the information contained in the connectome is relevant to activity. Can this relevant information be identified? In this study, we propose that the activity of each excitatory neuron in the sensory cortex can be approximated as a point in an embedding space defined by its connectome. Using the MICrONS dataset, which provides millimeter-scale, nanometer-resolution data on proofread and coregistered neurons, we perform a correlation analysis and identify a statistically significant alignment between morphological and functional similarities. Topological analysis reveals that the structured representation spaces of both neuronal activity and connectome share a low-dimensional, hyperbolic geometry with exponential scalability. Based on these findings, we develop a simple linear model to reconstruct in vivo neuronal activity by embedding anatomical affinities using multidimensional scaling (MDS). This approach achieves an explanation ratio of 68% compared to directly using activity similarity, outperforming the 56% obtained using the full connectome. Our results high-light a clear and robust structure-function coupling: although geometry-compatible dimensionality reduction methods discard much of the connectomes detailed information, they prove more effective in predicting neuronal activity, suggesting that synaptic connections may encode an abstract low-dimensional organization."

"UK Biobank studies show Parkinsons disease risk is almost doubled in men homozygous for the homeostatic iron regulator gene HFE p.C282Y polymorphism, associated with the common genetic iron disorder hemochromatosis. Whether this relationship is causal or spurious is unknown. We previously reported a novel Hfe-/-xTfr2mut mouse model of hemochromatosis with elevated brain iron ([~]1.5-1.8x). We now show these mice have reduced substantia nigra tyrosine hydroxylase expression at 3 months and 9 months age, sometimes exhibit severe hindlimb clasping by 7-8 months, have impaired rotarod and balance beam performance at 9 months and are untestable on the pole test. These parkinsonian features place the model at the forefront of genetic mouse models of PD, which generally do not show both TH loss and motor impairment. This confirms hemochromatosis-related mutations can cause parkinsonian features, substantiating causality of epidemiological relationships. Despite total brain iron elevation, neuronal iron remains low in Hfe-/-xTfr2mut mice, consistent with hemochromatosis-related mutations disrupting the normal, iron-responsive regulation of the neuronal iron exporter ferroportin by hepcidin. Parkinsonian features may reflect reduced mitochondrial respiratory complex (MRC) activity due to functional neuronal iron depletion. This may be exacerbated by indiscriminate chelation and could instead respond to drugs targeting the hepcidin-ferroportin axis or MRC activity. This new model of chronic parkinsonism that increases with age provides unprecedented insights into the complex relationships of brain iron regulation and movement impairment. Since parkinsonism of diverse etiologies can exhibit iron dysregulation, the model may facilitate pre-clinical to end-stage studies relevant to both sporadic and genetic PD."
"Animals respond to environmental cues to time phenological events, but the intrinsic mechanism of circannual timing remains elusive. We used transcriptomic sequencing and frequent sampling, during three distinct phases (induction, maintenance and recovery) of circannual interval timing for Djungarian hamster energy balance, to investigate the molecular architecture of a neuroendocrine seasonal clock. Our study identified three distinct phases of transcript changes, with deiodinase type-3 (Dio3) expression activated during the early induction phase. Subsequent work demonstrated that targeted mutation of Dio3 resulted in a shorter period for circannual interval timing. Hamsters that exhibit naturally disrupted Dio3 expression do not show any change in body mass or pelage. Our work demonstrates that changes in Dio3 induction is essential for setting the period of circannual interval timing."
"Double-strand break (DSB) repair is highly mutagenic compared to normal replication. In budding yeast, repair of an HO endonuclease-induced DSB at MAT can be repaired by using a transcriptionally silent HMR::Kl-URA3 donor. During repair, -1 deletions in homonucleotide runs are strongly favored over +1 insertions, whereas during replication, spontaneous +1 and -1 events are equal. Microhomology-bounded, repair-associated intragenic deletions (IDs) are recovered 12 times more frequently than tandem duplications (TDs). IDs have a mean length of 56 bp, while TDs average 22 bp. These data suggest a picture of the structure of the repair replication fork: IDs and TDs occur within the open structure of a migrating D-loop, where the 3 end of a partly copied new DNA strand can dissociate and anneal with a single-stranded region of microhomology that lies either [~]80 bp ahead or [~]40 bp behind the 3 end. Another major class of repair-associated mutations ([~]10%) are interchromosomal template switches (ICTS), even though the K. lactis URA3 sequence in HMR is only 72% identical (homeologous) with S. cerevisiae ura3-52. ICTS events begin and end at regions of short ([~]7 bp) microhomology; however, ICTS events are constrained to the middle of the copied sequence. Whereas microhomology usage in intragenic deletions is not influenced by adjacent homeology, we show that extensive pairing of adjacent homeology plays a critical role in ICTS. Thus, although by convention, structural variants are characterized by the precise base pairs at their junction, microhomology-mediated template switching actually requires alignment of extensive adjacent homeology.

Significance statementDNA synthesis during repair of a double-strand chromosome break by homologous recombination exhibits a high rate of mutation compared to normal replication. Using a genetic system in budding yeast, we isolated thousands of mutations occurring during repair. We conclude that the repair replication fork appears to have the two DNA strands open [~]80 bp ahead of the DNA polymerase, but the strands re-anneal rapidly behind the polymerase. Additionally, we analyzed interchromosomal template switching, in which the partially copied DNA strand dissociates and pairs with a new template at a short stretch of perfectly matching bases (microhomology), and resumes copying. We show that these apparent microhomology-mediated template switching events in fact require the pairing of [~]200 bp of imperfectly matching bases (homeology)."
"MotivationVarious methods have been proposed to construct metabolic networks from metabolomic data; however, small sample sizes, multiple confounding factors, the presence of indirect interactions as well as randomness in metabolic processes are of major concern.

ResultsIn this study, we benchmark existing algorithms for creating correlation- and regression-based networks of changes in metabolite abundance and we evaluate their performance across different sample sizes of a generative model. Using standard interaction-level tests and network-scale analyses based on centrality scores, we assess how well these methods capture simulated metabolomic networks. Our findings reveal significant challenges in network inference and result interpretation, even when sample sizes are significant and data are the result of computer modeling of metabolic pathways. Despite these limitations, we demonstrate that correlation-based network inference can, to some extent, discriminate between two different metabolic states. This suggests potential utility in distinguishing overarching changes in metabolic processes but not direct pathways in different conditions.

"Somatic hypermutation (SHM) is the diversity-generating process in antibody affinity maturation. Probabilistic models of SHM are needed for analyzing rare mutations, for understanding the selective forces guiding affinity maturation, and for understanding the underlying biochemical process. High throughput data offers the potential to develop and fit models of SHM on relevant data sets. In this paper we model SHM using modern frameworks. We are motivated by recent work suggesting the importance of a wider context for SHM, however, assigning an independent rate to each k-mer leads to an exponential proliferation of parameters. Thus, using convolutions on 3-mer embeddings, we develop ""thrifty"" models of SHM of various sizes; these can have fewer free parameters than a 5-mer model and yet have a significantly wider context. These offer a slight performance improvement over a 5-mer model, and other modern model elaborations worsen performance. We also find that a per-site effect is not necessary to explain SHM patterns given nucleotide context. Also, the two current methods for fitting an SHM model -- on out-of-frame sequence data and on synonymous mutations -- produce significantly different results, and augmenting out-of-frame data with synonymous mutations does not aid out-of-sample performance."
"Both in clinical practice and translational research, cell differentiation of leukocytes provides important information used for diagnostics or insights into pathophysiological mechanisms. The current gold-standard method for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis involves histochemical staining of cytospins, followed by manual morphological quantification. However, this approach is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and highly operator-dependent, limiting its efficiency and throughput. This study proposes a deep learning framework for rapid, automated 3D leukocyte differentiation using label-free higher harmonic generation microscopy (HHGM). 3D leukocyte characterization was performed with label-free HHGM. Two deep learning models, ResNet 3D-50 and Vision Transformer (ViT) 3D, were trained, validated and tested for leucocyte differentiation on both BALF and blood fraction samples from 14 interstitial lung disease (ILDs) and 12 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. Deep-learning model-prediction and cytospin analysis were performed by separate investigators. Results were compared using Bland-Altman analysis. The deep learning algorithm achieved >96% accuracy in quantifying neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages/monocytes. Bland-Altman analysis showed mean differences of less than 3% between cytospin analysis and the deep learning based approach across all cell types. By integrating the label-free imaging capabilities of HHGM with deep learning, this study established a fast, accurate and high-throughput leukocyte differentiation in fresh BALF and blood samples. By significantly improving efficiency and reproducibility, this technology has the potential to transform clinical workflows and advance precision medicine."
"An influential proposal in the field of cognitive neuroscience suggests that alpha-frequency brain oscillations constrain the temporal sampling of external sensory signals, shaping the temporal binding window (TBW)--the interval during which sensory signals are integrated. However, whether alpha frequency modulates the integration of self-related sensory signals and the perception of the body as ones own (body ownership) remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that individual alpha frequency (IAF) from the parietal cortex predicted TBWs and perceptual sensitivities in body ownership and visuotactile simultaneity judgment tasks, with faster frequencies narrowing TBWs and increasing sensitivities, and vice versa. Modulating IAF through brain stimulation altered TBWs and sensitivities, establishing a causal relationship. Computational modeling linked IAF to uncertainty in asynchrony information within the causal inference process, providing a mechanism. These findings demonstrate that parietal alpha frequency shapes the sense of body ownership by modulating the temporal integration of bodily sensory signals."
"Incomplete degradation of oxalate, a compound commonly found in the diet, can cause disease in humans, particularly of the kidney. Its concentration in the body depends on several factors, one of which is intestinal absorption, which is itself affected by oxalotrophy among enteric bacteria. Oxalotrophy in the human microbiome is poorly known. In this study, we perform a systematic search for the simultaneous presence of the three oxalotrophy genes, namely frc, oxc and oxlT. Thanks to the construction and validation of specific conservation models for all three genes, we were able to search for oxalotrophy in genomes and metagenomes associated with the human digestive tract, oral cavity, and lungs. We report that oxalotrophy - the capacity to use oxalate as a source of energy - is a rare metabolic trait, mostly confined to the gut, and also find evidence that it can be acquired by horizontal gene transfer. By contrast, the capacity for oxalate degradation is more widespread, and two genes responsible for it (frc and oxc) are almost always close together in the genome, suggesting selection pressure."
"The intestinal mucosal barrier contains microbial organisms within the lumen while preserving the ability to absorb nutrients. Dietary, microbial, and other exposures shaped human barrier evolution and continue to impact disease susceptibility. Here, we established engineered barrier models of the human small intestine and colon composed of a multilineage epithelium, mucus layer, accessible microbial compartment and autologous tissue-resident immune cells. The epithelium has crypt- and villus-like topological domains, with stem cells differentiating into absorptive and secretory lineages with region-specific identities. Secreted mucins accumulate apically, forming a dense mucus layer separating the epithelium from colonizing commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Intestinal memory T cells integrate into and interact with the epithelium. We use the engineered intestinal tissues to identify an epithelial gene regulatory network underlying response to Salmonella Typhimurium infection, and uncover epithelial-immune-pathogen crosstalk coordinating cytokine release and epithelial damage. Overall, this work allows for the modular integration of epithelial, microbial, and immune compartments providing a versatile system for studying human intestinal physiology and pathologies."
"BackgroundA growing body of evidence indicates alterations in metabolite levels and enzyme activities associated with the conversion of tryptophan (TRP) throughout the course of cerebral ischemia. In this study we aim to explore the potential relationship between TRP metabolism and clinical prognosis in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients of mainland China.

MethodsBlood samples were obtained from a cohort of 304 patients diagnosed with AIS. The concentrations of ten TRP metabolites were quantified utilizing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Stroke severity was evaluated upon admission using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). A poor functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin scale (mRS) > 3, whereas a good functional outcome was defined by mRS [&le;] 3 at 3 months post-stroke. LASSO regression and random forest algorithms were then employed to identify key TRP metabolism parameters associated with prognosis.

ResultsFollowing the optimization of variable selection through Lasso regression, a prognostic risk model with 7-factors related to AIS was constructed, yielding an AUC of 0.917. Subsequently, a random forest analysis was conducted to establish an 11-factor prognostic risk model, which demonstrated an enhanced AUC of 1.000. Ultimately, three robust parameters related to TRP metabolism were identified. Multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusted for covariates, revealed that TRP (odds ratio [OR] = 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26 - 0.76, p = 0.004), the kynurenine (KYN)/TRP ratio (OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.23 - 3.60, p = 0.008), and the kynurenic acid (KYNA)/TRP ratio (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.23 - 4.12, p = 0.014) were independently associated with poor functional prognosis.

ConclusionsThe results of this study indicate that TRP metabolism is associated with the severity and prognosis of AIS. The TRP, KYN/TRP ratio and KYNA/TRP ratio may serve as potential biomarkers for 3-month prognostic evaluation."
"The genomic diversity of many fungal species is augmented by accessory chromosomes, which are variably present in individual strains. These genomic regions evolve rapidly, accumulating genes important in pathogenicity but also harboring significant amounts of transposable elements (TEs). This duality suggests a trade-off: accessory chromosomes provide infection-related benefits while otherwise being deleterious due to their highly repetitive nature and contributions to genomic instability. Despite this, accessory chromosomes often appear to be stably maintained even when strains are grown on media, with no plant host. Previously, we had observed that genes homologous to meiotic drive toxin/antidote proteins from Podospora anserina (Spoks) are abundant on accessory chromosomes in various Fusarium species. Using a functionality screen in yeast, we demonstrate that some of these homologs have active toxin and antidote properties. We propose that these selfish genes act to maintain accessory chromosomes during vegetative growth and may influence their spread via parasexual cycles. Finally, as Spok genes are mobilized by the newly described TE superfamily Starships, it suggests these TEs play crucial roles in forming accessory chromosomes and regions. These results illuminate a mysterious facet of fungal biology, a key step towards describing the origin, spread, and maintenance of pathogenicity in many fungal species."
"Activities of daily living rely on our ability to acquire new motor skills composed of precise action sequences. Here, we asked if the millisecond-level neural representation of an action performed at different contextual sequence locations within a skill differentiates or remains stable during early motor learning. We first optimized machine learning decoders predictive of sequence-embedded finger movements from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity. Using this approach, we found that the neural representation of the same action performed in different contextual sequence locations, progressively differentiated--primarily during rest intervals of early learning (offline)--correlating with skill gains. In contrast, representational differentiation during practice (online) did not reflect learning. The regions contributing to this representational differentiation evolved with learning, shifting from the contralateral pre- and post-central cortex during early learning (trials 1-11) to increased involvement of the superior and middle frontal cortex once skill performance plateaued (trials 12-36). Thus, the neural substrates supporting finger movements and their representational differentiation during early skill learning differ from those supporting stable performance during the subsequent skill plateau period. Representational contextualization extended to Day 2, exhibiting specificity for the practiced skill sequence. Altogether, our findings indicate that sequence action representations contextually differentiate during early skill learning, an issue relevant to brain-computer interface applications in neurorehabilitation."
"Advances in machine learning have transformed structural biology, enabling swift and accurate prediction of protein structure from sequence. However, challenges persist in capturing sidechain packing, condition-dependent conformational dynamics, and biomolecular interactions, primarily due to scarcity of high-quality training data. Emerging techniques, including cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and high-throughput crystallography, promise vast new sources of structural data, but translating experimental observations into mechanistically interpretable atomic models remains a key bottleneck. Here, we address these challenges by improving the efficiency of structural analysis through combining experimental measurements with a landmark protein structure prediction method - AlphaFold2. We present an augmentation of AlphaFold2, ROCKET, that refines its predictions using cryo-EM, cryo-ET, and X-ray crystallography data, and demonstrate that this approach captures biologically important structural variation that AlphaFold2 does not. By performing structure optimization in the space of coevolutionary embeddings, rather than Cartesian coordinates, ROCKET automates difficult modeling tasks, such as flips of functional loops and domain rearrangements, that are beyond the scope of current state-of-the-art methods and, in some instances, even manual human modeling. The ability to efficiently sample these barrier-crossing rearrangements unlocks a new horizon for scalable and automated model building. Crucially, ROCKET does not require retraining of AlphaFold2 and is readily adaptable to multimers, ligand-cofolding, and other data modalities. Conversely, our differentiable crystal-lographic and cryo-EM target functions are capable of augmenting other structure prediction methods. ROCKET thus provides an extensible framework for the integration of experimental observables with biomolecular machine learning."

Therefore, the authors do not wish this work to be cited as reference for the project. If you have any questions, please contact the corresponding author."
"Obesity is a major public health problem globally and there is considerable interest in the neural mechanisms in food overconsumption. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, has shown promise in characterizing links between brain morphometry and obesity. In 1106 adults, compared to other forms of machine learning, deep learning using 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNN) dramatically improves prediction of body mass index (BMI). The 3D-CNN model robustly predicted BMI (R2 =.325), outperforming random forest, elastic net, and tabnet models (R2s<.07) in a  lockbox sample. Explainable AI analyses revealed the specific brain regions implicated and these regions were moderately associated with delay discounting, fluid cognition, gait speed, dexterity, and alcohol use. Collectively, these findings reveal the value of deep learning for understanding of the neural basis and motivational processes in the neurobiology of obesity."
"Targeted gene editing can be achieved using CRISPR/Cas9-assisted recombineering. However, high-efficiency editing requires careful optimization for each locus to be modified which can be tedious and time-consuming. In this work, we developed a simple, fast and cheap method for the Editing and Assembly of SYnthetic operons using CRISPR/Cas9-assisted recombineering (EASY-CRISPR) in Escherichia coli. Highly efficient editing of the different constitutive elements of the operons can be achieved by using a set of optimized guide RNAs and single- or double-stranded DNA repair templates carrying relatively short homology arms. This facilitates the construction of multiple genetic tools, including mutant libraries or reporter genes. EASY-CRISPR is also highly modular, as we provide alternative and complementary versions of the operon inserted in three loci which can be edited iteratively and easily combined. As a proof of concept, we report the construction of several fusions with reporter genes confirming known post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms and the construction of saturated and unbiased mutant libraries.

In summary, the EASY-CRISPR system provides a flexible genomic expression platform that can be used both for the understanding of biological processes and as a tool for bioengineering applications."
"Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is responsible for an estimated 112,000 deaths per year. We studied the role of the Hog1/p38 and Gcn2 signal transduction pathways during adaptation of C. neoformans to oxidative stress, a physiologically relevant stressor during infection. Using a combination of molecular assays and RNA-sequencing analysis in Hog1-, Gcn2-and double-deleted mutants, we identify shared targets of these pathways, and investigate a negative feedback loop that regulates induction of the integrated stress response (ISR). We found that simultaneous loss of Hog1 and Gcn2 profoundly impacts the ability of C. neoformans to tolerate oxidative stress. We also show that Hog1 regulates induction of the ISR, and that the Hog1 and Gcn2 pathways converge on repression of abundant, pro-growth mRNA, a key step in translatome reprogramming. Our results establish Hog1 and Gcn2 as key regulators of the response to oxidative stress, and demonstrate that the interplay between these pathways is critical for ROS tolerance in C. neoformans. More broadly, our results demonstrate the extent to which signaling via Hog1/p38 and Gcn2 are linked, and point to extensive recalibration of the cellular signaling apparatus when one of these pathways is disrupted.

Author SummaryCryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that causes deadly infections, resulting in approximately 112,000 deaths per year. In this study, we examined two genes that are important for the ability of C. neoformans to tolerate stressors it would encounter in the human body: Hog1 and Gcn2. We found that Hog1 and Gcn2 perform overlapping functions during the fungal response to stress. These findings are important because they highlight the potential benefits of targeting these pathways in conjunction to treat infection with C. neoformans. These findings could be used to develop new drug or treatment strategies to reduce the disease burden associated with this infection."
"The central dogma serves as a fundamental framework for understanding the flow and expression of genetic information within living organisms, facilitating the connection of diverse biological sequences across molecule types. In this study, we present CD-GPT (Central Dogma Generative Pretrained Transformer), a generative biological foundation model with 1 billion parameters, aiming to capture the sequence relationships between DNA, RNA, and proteins. We model sequences in a unified representational space and employ a shared, multi-molecule vocabulary to narrow their distances in the embedding space effectively. Through extensive pretraining on nucleotide and amino acid sequence data, CD-GPT exhibits exceptional performance in a wide range of predictive and generative downstream tasks, including mono-molecular and multi-molecular analyses. Notably, CD-GPT excels in tasks such as genomic element detection, protein property prediction, RNA-protein interaction identification and also generative tasks like protein generation and reverse translation. The versatility of CD-GPT opens up promising avenues for advanced multi-omics analysis."
"The dynamic transformations of physicochemical, microbiological, and metagenomic profiles in Queso Crema de Chiapas were studied during distinct ripening stages (2, 29, and 58 days). While the fundamental physicochemical characteristics--including protein, fat, and salt content--remained remarkably stable, a distinctive evolution in microbial diversity was observed, characterized by a decline in bacterial genera and a concurrent increase in fungi and yeasts as maturation progressed.

The most abundant bacterial genera were Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, and Lactococcus throughout ripening. Streptococcus and Lactobacillus increased as ripening time progressed, while Lactococcus exhibited an opposite trend. In addition, several predominant fungal species were identified across the three ripening periods, including Candida versatilis, Candida etchellsii, and Candida tropicalis.

Candida etchelsii decreased, and Candida tropicalis increased with ripening time. Notably, low levels of potentially pathogenic microorganisms were detected. This study highlights the influence of ripening duration on microbial composition, providing valuable insights for the production of artisanal cheeses and the enhancement of their quality."
"Aminoacyl-tRNA deacylases safeguard the accurate translation of the genetic code by hydrolyzing incorrectly synthesized aminoacyl-tRNAs. Canavanyl-tRNA deacylase (CtdA) was recently shown to protect cells against the toxicity of the non-proteinogenic amino acid canavanine, which is synthesized and accumulated by various plants. In most organisms, canavanine is ligated to tRNAArg, causing translation of arginine codons with canavanine. CtdA prevents canavanine toxicity by hydrolyzing canavanyl-tRNAArg. Here, we investigated the function, structure, substrate specificity, phylogenetic distribution, and evolution of CtdA. We show that CtdA is essential to prevent canavanine cytotoxicity in Salmonella enterica, and its heterologous expression can also rescue Escherichia coli. By determining the structure of CtdA, we identified its putative binding pocket and residues that modulate enzymatic activity and specificity. We also found that CtdA displays a relaxed specificity for the aminoacyl moiety substrate as it hydrolyzes arginyl-tRNAArg. Finally, we showed that despite their structural homology, CtdA and the aminoacyl-tRNA hydrolytic domain of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase are functionally and evolutionarily divergent. Collectively, these results substantially expand our understanding of the CtdA family, providing new insights into its structure, function, and evolution. Moreover, this work highlights the diverse mechanisms unique to each organism to ensure faithful translation of the genetic code."
"The Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) is widely recognized as the gold standard for diagnosing zoonosis leptospirosis. However, its reliance on examiners subjective evaluations often leads to inconsistent results. To address this limitation, we propose a deep neural network replicating the agglutination rate estimation in MAT. By leveraging a pre-trained DenseNet121, the network parameters are optimized efficiently during training. We validated our approach using an in-house dataset, and experimental results show that the proposed network achieves accurate agglutination rate estimates. In addition, we employed a standard visualization technique to elucidate the decision-making process, revealing that the network captures image features indicative of leptospire abundance. Overall, our findings suggest that deep learning effectively estimates agglutination rates and that enhancing interpretability supports medical experts in understanding the underlying functionality of deep learning models."
"Plasticity of intact neural tissue in the vicinity of neural damage serves to restoring functionality of circuits. Much remains to be learned about the mechanisms regulating this process and the reported sex differences in recovery outcomes. Here we present the fly gut and its innervation as simplified model to address these questions. We show that gut damage caused by ingestion of toxic agents resulted in plasticity of the enteric neuronal network, manifested as a Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-dependent increase in neural tissue, which was reversible after a recovery period. Interestingly, males did not display neural plasticity, and masculinization of neurons in females suppressed the damage-dependent neural growth. Together, these findings position the fly gut as a system to investigate the cellular, molecular and sex-specific underpinnings of neural plasticity, with implications for therapeutic advancements in neural circuit recovery."
"The origin of the Huang surname is complex, but according to historical texts such as Shiji, it can be traced back to the Yellow Emperor (Huang Di) and his descendant, Bo Yi, who played a key role in controlling the floods during the Xia Dynasty and was granted the surname Ying. Bo Yi had two sons who each established a state, one named Huang and the other Xu. After the fall of Huang, its people adopted Huang as their surname and migrated to Hubei. Similarly, after the fall of Xu, its people adopted Xu as their surname, spreading throughout Jiangsu. Further descendants of Bo Yi also gave rise to 12 other surnames, including the Liang surname. Given that the narratives of ancient texts are often regarded as legendary, we aim to independently verify the authenticity of the historical records by analyzing the paternal haplotypes of the Huang surname and its related surnames using scientific methods. We analyzed the surname genetic data of 207,333 Han Chinese males published by 23Mofang and combined it with independent sequencing research. In 189 Y chromosome haplotype branches, each containing at least five individuals with the surnames Huang, Xu, or Liang, and formed around 4,000 years ago, we analyzed the proportion of samples with the Huang surname from Hubei among all samples nationwide with the Huang surname. Branches with a high proportion in Hubei are likely to represent the Hubei-specific lineage of the Huang surname. We similarly analyzed the proportion of samples with the Xu surname in the Jiangsu area and of samples with the Liang surname in the Hebei area. We further applied two criteria to identify the ancestral genotype of a specific surname in a given region: first, the surname should appear at a high frequency among all surnames within that genotype; second, the proportion of samples of the region among nationwide samples should be high. The results showed that the Hubei-specific Huang surname likely carries the MF14296/MF15137 haplotype downstream of the supergrandfather O-M117-F8-F2137-A16635-A16636. Our independent sampling study found that A16636 is the dominant haplotype among the Huang surname population in nine neighboring Huang surname villages around Luohansi in Huangpi, Hubei. The Jiangsu-specific Xu surname likely carries the MF38096/SK1726 haplotype under the A16636 sister branch F15823, while the Hebei-specific Liang surname likely carries the F15823 related MF14287/MF15398/MF14963 haplotype. This conclusion aligns with the historical records, providing strong genetic evidence that supports the authenticity of these ancestral claims regarding the Huang and Xu states and the Xia dynasty."
"Grapevines are among the most economically important fruit crops, and microbiome profoundly influence their health, yield, and quality. However, mechanistic insights into microbiome-orchestrated grapevine biology remain limited. Here, we conduct large-scale pan-metagenomic and pan-metatranscriptomic analyses of the phyllosphere microbiome from 107 grapevine accessions spanning 34 Vitis species. We show that the grapevine core microbiome is dominated by phylum Bacillota and Pseudomonadota. Leveraging HiFi long-read sequencing technology, we assembled 19 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the grapevine pan-microbiome, representing the first MAG reconstruction in plant-associated microbial communities using HiFi long reads. These MAGs encode genes associated with antibiotic resistance, secondary metabolism, and carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), which could potentially influence grapevine biology. During downy mildew (DM) infection, DM-resistant grapevines exhibit significantly higher microbial network complexity than susceptible counterparts. Among the key taxa contributing to this complexity, Bacillota emerged as the dominant phylum with displaying strong abundance correlations with phylum Euglenozoa and Cyanobacteriota, and an isolated Bacillota species from the grapevine leaves, Bacillus cereus, demonstrated potent biocontrol activity against DM infection. Pan-metatranscriptomic analysis further revealed significant upregulation of eukaryotic microbial genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism. This pan-metagenomic study offers unprecedented insights into the complex structure, diversity and functional roles of grapevine phyllosphere microbiome, and presents valuable genomic and microbial resources for microbiome research and engineering to enhance viticulture productivity and quality."
"In Gram-negative bacteria, porins span the outer membrane and control the influx of several prominent groups of antibiotics. Expression of these porins is often altered in clinical isolates exhibiting multidrug resistance. The major regulator of porin expression in Escherichia coli is EnvZ, a canonical sensor histidine kinase. It allosterically processes periplasmic interactions with MzrA and cytoplasmic osmosensing into a single unified change in the ratio of its kinase and phosphatase activities. To better understand how transmembrane communication is achieved by EnvZ, we began by performing disulfide crosslinking to monitor the position and dynamics of helices within the transmembrane domain in vivo and correlated these with modulation of signal output. Subsequently, we employed atomistic molecular dynamic simulations on full-length EnvZ embedded in a model Gram-negative membrane and observed that this in silico analysis accurately predicted the structure of the transmembrane domain embedded in the bacterial membrane. We conclude by proposing that the signal output of EnvZ correlates with its potential for water encapsulation within the transmembrane helical bundle and with unwinding of a helix adjacent to the periplasmic end of the second transmembrane helix. When combined with results from other bacterial receptors, it remains plausible that water encapsulation occurs in other topologically similar sensor kinases."
"BackgroundEpistasis, or genetic interaction, has been increasingly recognized for its ubiquity and for its role in susceptibility to common human diseases, such as Alzheimers. A wide variety of epistasis detection tools are currently available with several studies comparing the performance of methods suitable for case-control data. However, there is limited understanding of how well these tools perform with quantitative phenotypes.

MethodsWe identified six epistasis detection methods suitable for quantitative phenotype data: EpiSNP, Matrix Epistasis, MIDESP, PLINK Epistasis, QMDR, and REMMA. To evaluate these tools, we generated simulated datasets using EpiGEN. The datasets modeled various pairwise interactions between disease-associated SNPs, including dominant, multiplicative, recessive, and XOR interactions. Additionally, we assessed the BOOST and MDR algorithms on discretized (case-control) version of the datasets. These tools were then tested on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset for the externalizing behavior phenotype.

ResultsEach tool exhibited strong performance for certain interaction types, but weaker performance for others. MDR achieved the highest overall detection rate of 60%, while EpiSNP had the lowest overall detection rate of 7%. MDR and MIDESP performed best at detecting multiplicative interactions with detection rates of 54% and 41% respectively. Both MDR and MIDESP were also effective at detecting XOR interactions with detection rates of 84% and 50% respectively. PLINK Epistasis, Matrix Epistasis, and REMMA excelled at detecting dominant interactions, all achieving a 100% detection rate. On the other hand, EpiSNP was particularly effective at detecting recessive interactions with a detection rate of 66%. When analyzing the ABCD dataset, Plink Epistasis and Plink BOOST identified SNPs within the DRD2 and DRD4 genes, which have been previously linked to externalizing behavior.

ConclusionSince no single method consistently outperforms others across all types of epistasis, and given that the specific types of epistasis present in a dataset are often unknown, it may be more effective to use multiple epistasis detection algorithms in combination to obtain comprehensive results."
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) pharmacological correctors improve Cystic Fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein trafficking and function. Several side-effects from these correctors and adverse drug interactions have been reported, emphasizing the need to understand off-targets. We synthesized VU439, a functionalized photoaffinity ligand (PAL) of VX-445. Chemoproteomics analysis by mass spectrometry (MS) was used to identify crosslinked proteins in CF bronchial epithelial cells expressing F508del CFTR. We identified saccharopine dehydrogenase-like oxidoreductase (SCCPDH), an uncharacterized putative oxidoreductase, as a VX-445 specific off-target. We then characterized changes in the metabolomic profiles of cells overexpressing SCCPDH to determine the consequence of VX-445 binding to SCCPDH. These data show dysregulation of amino acid metabolism and a potential inhibitory activity of VX-445 on SCCPDH. The identified off-target may explain exacerbation of psychological symptoms observed in the clinic, thus emphasizing the need for further optimization of correctors."
"In nature, insects face immense predation pressure, where visual cues play a vital role in predators locating them. To counter this threat, insects employ a variety of nano- and microstructures on their cuticular layer to manipulate and interact with light, enhancing anti-reflective properties and providing camouflage or reducing detectability by predators. Leafhoppers have a unique extra-cuticular coating called brochosome, yet its anti-reflective functions and protein composition remain unclear. Our study demonstrates strong anti-reflective properties of brochosomes, effectively reducing reflectance on the cuticle surface, especially in the ultraviolet spectrum, to improve evasion from visual predators. Furthermore, we identify four novel structural proteins of the brochosome (BSM) for the first time. Inhibiting their synthesis by RNAi alters brochosome morphology, impacting the optical properties of the cuticle surface. Evolutionary origin analysis of BSM suggests that brochosomes likely originated from a process involving duplication-divergence. Our study reveals that leafhoppers employ a unique camouflage strategy by secreting brochosomes as anti-reflection nano-coatings, enabling them to evade natural predators and contributing to their evolutionary success."
"Information flow through circuits is dictated by the precise connectivity of neurons and glia. While a single astrocyte can contact many synapses, how glial-synaptic interactions are arranged within a single circuit to impact information flow remains understudied. Here, we use the local spinal sensorimotor circuit in zebrafish as a model to understand how neurons and astroglia are connected in a vertebrate circuit. With semi-automated cellular reconstructions and automated approaches to map all the synaptic connections, we identified the precise synaptic connections of the local sensorimotor circuit, from dorsal root ganglia neurons to spinal interneurons and finally to motor neurons. This revealed a complex network of interneurons that interact in the local sensorimotor circuit. We then mapped the glial processes within tripartite synapses in the circuit. We demonstrate that tripartite synapses are equally distributed across the circuit, supporting the idea that glia can modulate information flow through the circuit at different levels. We show that multiple astroglia, including bona fide astrocytes, contact synapses within a single sensory neurons circuit and that each of these astroglia can contact multiple parts of the circuit. This detailed map reveals an extensive network of connected neurons and astroglia that process sensory stimuli in a vertebrate. We then utilized this ultrastructural map to model how synaptic thresholding and glial modulation could alter information flow in circuits. We validated this circuit map with GCaMP6s imaging of dorsal root ganglia, spinal neurons and astroglia. This work provides a foundational resource detailing the ultrastructural organization of neurons and glia in a vertebrate circuit, offering insights in how glia could influence information flow in complex neural networks."
"Privacy is paramount in health data, particularly in human genetics, where information extends beyond individuals to their relatives. Metagenomic datasets contain substantial human genetic material, necessitating careful handling to mitigate data leakage risks when sharing or publishing. The same applies to genetic datasets from the environment or datasets from contaminated laboratory samples, although to a lesser extent. To address these topics, we developed nf-core/detaxizer, a nextflow-based pipeline that employs Kraken2 and bbmap/bbduk for taxonomic classification, identifying and optionally filtering Homo sapiens reads. Due to its generalized design, other taxa can also be classified and filtered. We benchmark its filtering efficacy for human reads against Hostile and CLEAN, demonstrating its utility for secure data preprocessing. The comparison revealed that the choice of tool and database can lead to an order of magnitude more human data not removed. As part of the nf-core initiative, nf-core/detaxizer adheres to best practices, leveraging containerized dependencies for streamlined installation. The source code is openly available under the MIT license: https://github.com/nf-core/detaxizer."
"Filamins are dimeric actin binding protein that play a critical role in mechanical signaling. They contain a mechanosensory region (MSR) that naturally folds into a globular closed conformation. Under mechanical stress, the MSR unfolds into an open conformation, exposing binding sites for numerous proteins. Filamins are involved in diverse cellular functions, and their mechanical binding targets are highly context dependent. In this study, we employed AlphaFold2 modeling for screening proteins that specifically recognize the open conformation of filamins. We focused on the Drosophila melanogaster filamin, Cheerio, and conducted a biased screen to identify mechanical binding proteins. We selected the top 132 hits from the initial screening for further characterization. All identified binding proteins specifically recognize the open conformation of the MSR and not the closed conformation. Interestingly, the binding regions of these proteins lack obvious sequence similarity. While some false positives were identified, they could be effectively filtered out based on the secondary structure formed at the binding interface. This study provides a framework for identifying specifically filamin interactions in mechanosignaling."
"The unique cytoskeletal protein Septin7 is generally considered to be required for cytokinesis in yeast and mammals. Whole body genetic ablation of Septin7 in mice is embryonic lethal. Septin7-deficient fibroblasts and HeLa cells are defective in cytokinesis and undergo obligate multinucleation. Unexpectedly, lymphocyte- and myeloid-specific targeting of Septin7 in mice revealed no abnormalities in blood lineage development, suggesting that Septin7 is not required for hematopoiesis. To reconcile these contradictory findings, we analyzed the effects of Septin7 deletion in hematopoietic cells from mice with either pan-hematopoietic or lymphoid lineage-specific Septin7 deletion. Our results demonstrate that Cre-induced deletion of the floxed Septin7 allele is inefficient during the early stages of hematopoiesis, suggesting strong selection pressure against Septin7 deficiency at this stage. In contrast, deletion of Septin7 at the common lymphoid progenitor stage, as well as in Hoxb8-immortalized hematopoietic progenitors, is efficient and does not result in any noticeable defects in cell division. Taken together, our findings indicate that Septin7 is essential during early hematopoiesis but becomes dispensable at later stages.

"Mapping the vascular organization of the brain is of great importance across various domains of basic neuroimaging research, diagnostic radiology, and neurology. However, the intricate task of precisely mapping vasculature across brain regions and cortical layers presents formidable challenges, resulting in a limited understanding of neurometabolic factors influencing the brains microvasculature. Addressing this gap, our study investigates whole-brain vascular volume using ferumoxytol-weighted laminar-resolution multi-echo gradient-echo imaging in macaque monkeys. We validate the results with published data for vascular densities and compare them with cytoarchitecture, neuron and synaptic densities. The ferumoxytol-induced change in transverse relaxation rate ({Delta}R2*), an indirect proxy measure of cerebral blood volume (CBV), was mapped onto twelve equivolumetric laminar cortical surfaces. Our findings reveal that CBV varies 3-fold across the brain, with the highest vascular volume observed in the inferior colliculus and lowest in the corpus callosum. In the cerebral cortex, CBV is notably high in early primary sensory areas and low in association areas responsible for higher cognitive functions. Classification of CBV into distinct groups unveils extensive replication of translaminar vascular network motifs, suggesting distinct computational energy supply requirements in areas with varying cytoarchitecture types. Regionally, baseline R2* and CBV exhibit positive correlations with neuron density and negative correlations with receptor densities. Adjusting image resolution based on the critical sampling frequency of penetrating cortical vessels allows us to delineate approximately 30% of the arterial-venous vessels. Collectively, these results mark significant methodological and conceptual advancements, contributing to the refinement of cerebrovascular MRI. Furthermore, our study establishes a linkage between neurometabolic factors and the vascular network architecture in the primate brain.

"Algorithms for ligand-receptor network inference have emerged as commonly used tools to estimate cell-cell communication from reference single-cell data. Many studies employ these algorithms to compare signaling between conditions and lack methods to statistically identify signals that are significantly different. We previously developed the cell communication inference algorithm Domino, which considers ligand and receptor gene expression in association with downstream transcription factor activity scoring. We developed the dominoSignal software to innovate upon Domino and extend its functionality to test statistically differential cellular signaling. This new functionality includes compilation of active signals as linkages from multiple subjects in a single-cell data set and testing condition-dependent signaling linkage. The software is applicable for analysis of single-cell data sets with multiple subjects as biological replicates as well as with bootstrapped replicates from data sets with few or pooled subjects. We use simulation studies to benchmark the number of subjects in compared groups and cells within an annotated cell type sufficient to accurately identify differential linkages. We demonstrate the application of the Differential Cell Signaling Test (DCST) in the dominoSignal software to investigate consequences of cancer cell phenotypes and immunotherapy on cell-cell communication in tumor microenvironments. These applications in cancer studies demonstrate the ability of differential cell signaling analysis to infer changes to cell communication networks from therapeutic or experimental perturbations, which is broadly applicable across biological systems."
"Spatial transcriptomics quantifies gene expression within its spatial context, significantly advancing biomedical research. Understanding gene spatial expression and the organization of multicellular systems is vital for disease diagnosis and studying biological processes. However, existing models often struggle to integrate gene expression data with cellular spatial information effectively. In this study, we introduce SpatialFormer, a hybrid framework combining convolutional networks and transformers to learn single-cell multimodal and multi-scale information in the niche context, including expression data and subcellular gene spatial distribution. Pre-trained on 300 million cell pairs from 12 million spatially resolved single cells across 62 Xenium slides, SpatialFormer merges gene spatial expression profiles with cell niche information via the pair-wise training strategy. Our findings demonstrate that SpatialFormer distills biological signals across various tasks, including single-cell batch correction, cell-type annotation, co-localization detection, and identifying gene pairs that are critical for the immune cell-cell interactions involved in the regulation of lung fibrosis. These advancements enhance our understanding of cellular dynamics and offer new pathways for applications in biomedical research."
"Goal-directed motor performance relies on the brains ability to distinguish between actions that lead to successful and unsuccessful outcomes. The basal ganglia (BG) and cerebellum (CBL) are integral to processing performance outcomes, yet their functional interactions remain underexplored. This study scanned participants brains with functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) while they performed a skilled motor task for monetary rewards, where outcomes depended on their motor performance and also probabilistic events that were not contingent on their performance. We found successful motor outcomes increased activity in the ventral striatum (VS), a functional sub-region of the BG, whereas unsuccessful motor outcomes engaged the CBL. In contrast, for probabilistic outcomes unrelated to motor performance, the BG and CBL exhibited no differences in activity between successful and unsuccessful outcomes. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that VS-to-CBL connectivity was inhibitory following successful motor outcomes, suggesting that the VS may suppress CBL error processing for correct actions. Conversely, CBL-to-VS connectivity was inhibitory after unsuccessful motor outcomes, potentially preventing reinforcement of erroneous actions. Additionally, interindividual differences in task preference, assessed by having participants choose between performing the motor task or flipping a coin for monetary rewards, were related to inhibitory VS-CBL connectivity. These findings highlight a performance-mediated functional network between the VS and CBL, modulated by motivation and subjective preferences, supporting goal-directed behavior."
"Argonaute (AGO) mediated slicing of RNA--also known as RNAi--is a highly conserved phenomenon that is evolutionarily linked to the repression of transposons and other repeats. Although RNAi is no longer a major mechanism of repeat control in mammals, AGO2 has retained cleavage competence and is able to efficiently cut RNAs with extensive complementarity to a bound guide. The regulatory roles this activity plays in mammals however remains poorly understood. Here we show that mice carrying two catalytically inactive Ago2 alleles have extensive developmental abnormalities including systemic vascular defects that are characterized by enlarged and leaky vessels and stem from endothelial cell dysfunction. Endothelial cell defects are caused by failure to repress Rtl1, a paternally-imprinted domesticated retrotransposon, whose cleavage in wild-type animals is triggered by miRNAs of the maternally-imprinted miR-433[~]127 cluster. Our data pinpoint an essential mRNA cleavage target of AGO2 and suggest that the repurposing of a TE-Argonaute regulatory interaction contributes to the retention of AGO catalytic competence in mammals."
"A growing population consists of successive generations of individuals interacting with each other and their environment. At every instant, these interactions can lead to either promotion or restriction of the population growth. Thus, within a growing population, differences arise over time due to both extrinsic and intrinsic factors such as resource utilization, competition, age distribution etc. These differences can lead to divergence within the population growth. The sum of these differences is manifested as the net population growth. In this work, we propose that these differences that arise over time within a growing population can be represented as two distinct S-curves. The sum of these two S-curves results in the growth curve of a population. These differences also arise in the growth curves of a populations attributes such as height or weight. We demonstrate this by applying the a- m biological growth model on (i) the population growth curves of Drosophila and yeast and (ii) the growth curves of the mean height of a population of sunflower plants and the mean body weight of male white rats. Finally, we also discuss the results using a coordinate system with the two distinct S-curves as the axes."
"Environmental DNA (eDNA) offers a promising avenue for reconstructing the genetic diversity and demographic history of ancient populations. However, the analysis of eDNA from humans or forensic DNA, presents significant challenges, including low coverage, DNA degradation, and the uncertainty of the number of individuals contributing to a sample. This study introduces CHARON, a novel statistical method for jointly estimating the number of individuals and drift times between a human eDNA or forensic sample and a given population with known allele frequencies. We validate our method through simulations and synthetic empirical data and show that we can reliably estimate the number of individuals up to 8 at a coverage between 2X and 4X. Our method can also pinpoint the most likely population of origin for eDNA or forensic samples. This work provides a tool for the application of human eDNA in evolutionary and forensic studies and an implementation is available here: https://github.com/Jan-van-Waaij/Charon"
"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients suffer from skeletal and cardiopulmonary weakness, and interestingly up to one third are diagnosed on the autism spectrum. Dystrophin is an essential protein for regulating the transmission of intracellular force to the extracellular matrix within the skeletal muscle, but also plays key roles in neurobehavior and cognitive function. The mouse dystrophin gene (also abbreviated Dmd) is X-linked and has several isoforms with tissue-specific expression, including the large Dp427m muscle transcript found in heart and skeletal muscle, and the Dp427c transcript that encodes the brain-specific dystrophin cerebellar protein. Understanding the functional requirements and pathways that are affected by dystrophin loss will impact dystrophin replacement gene therapy and exon-skipping correction strategies. We generated conditional Dystrophin knockout mice by targeting exon 52 of the mouse Dystrophin (Dmdflox52) locus. We generated dystrophin constitutive and inducible myofiber knockout (Dmd mKO) mice to evaluate the tissue-specific function of the large skeletal muscle dystrophin isoform. Constitutive embryonic deletion of the Dystrophin gene exclusively in skeletal myofibers resulted in a severe skeletal muscle myopathy, dystrophic histopathology, and functional deficits compared to the mdx mouse. Transcriptomic analysis of skeletal myofibers of the Dmd mKO mice revealed the dysregulation of key extracellular matrix and cytokine signaling pathways. Separately, we generated Purkinje neuron cerebellar dystrophin knockout (Dmd:Pcp2 KO) mice that displayed neurobehavioral deficits in social approach, social memory, and spatial navigation and working memory. These studies reveal the essential requirement for dystrophin expression in both the skeletal muscle and brain for normal physiological and neurobehavioral function.

Significance StatementDuchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by the lack of a functional dystrophin protein in muscle. The large dystrophin (Dp427m) isoform is expressed in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle, but its tissue-specific requirements remain unknown. We generated and characterized a conditional skeletal muscle knockout mouse (Dmd mKO). Constitutive embryonic genetic ablation of skeletal muscle Dystrophin resulted in muscle histopathologies similar to the mdx mouse, while postnatal muscle Dystrophin ablation resulted in milder pathologies. Ablating cerebellar Dystrophin Dp427c using a Pcp2/L7-Cre driver resulted in sociobehavioral defects. Transcriptomic analysis of the Dmd mKO mice showed a severe reduction of extracellular matrix and cytokine signaling pathways. Our study reveals an essential role for skeletal muscle dystrophin and identifies essential pathways for modulation using dystrophin-replacement therapies."
"We recently described CRISPR/Cas9-based short homology-dependent genome engineering in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, a haploid budding yeast that is the most common cause of fungal meningitis and an emerging model organism. This was achieved by electroporation of strains stably expressing a codon-optimized Cas9 with two separate DNA molecules, one encoding a selectable marker flanked by short homology arms and a second encoding a sgRNA under the control of the U6 snRNA promoter. However, the efficiency of desired homology-dependent repair relative to undesired non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) events can be low and variable. Here, we describe methods and strains enabling extremely efficient ([~]99%) homology-dependent genome editing in C. neoformans. This high-efficiency method requires two manipulations. First, we placed the sgRNA-expressing segment into the marker-containing DNA flanked by targeting homology; thus, only a single DNA molecule is introduced into cells. Second, we used a strain mutant for the non-homologous end-joining factor Ku80 (encoded by YKU80). We also report the engineering of a yku80::amdS mutant strain harboring an insertion mutation that can be removed scarlessly via recombination between direct repeats. This enables the functional restoration of YKU80 after homology- dependent genome editing via selection against the amdS marker using fluoroacetamide. This approach minimizes documented drawbacks of using Ku-defective strains in downstream experiments. Finally, we describe a plasmid series that enables rapid cloning of sgRNA-marker constructs for genomic manipulation of C. neoformans, including gene deletion and C-terminal tagging. These methods, strains, and plasmids accelerate the genomic manipulation of C. neoformans."
"Impaired activity of glutamate transporters, elevated concentration of extrasynaptic glutamate and hyperactivity of extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors are common features in aging and several neurological conditions, including Alzheimers disease (AD). Previous studies revealed that polysialic acid (polySia), a glycan predominantly carried by the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM, inhibits extrasynaptic NMDA receptors and supports synaptic plasticity in healthy adult brains. Moreover, intranasal delivery of polySia with the degree of polymerization 12 (NANA12) rescued synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions in models of tauopathy and amyloidosis associated with AD. Here, we comparatively studied the effects of NANA12 in young (4 months) old (26 months) and very old (29 months) mice. Strikingly, NANA12 promoted cognitive flexibility in attentional set-shifting (ASST) tests and spatial memory in the Barnes maze in very old mice. To capture fine-grained effects undetectable by conventional methods, we introduced a novel trial-wise data analysis approach for evaluating ASST performance. The observed cognitive improvements were not due to changes in the size of hippocampal memory engrams, visualized by c-Fos immunolabeling after reactivation of spatial memory in the probe trial. Five-day treatment with NANA12 did not affect neuronal structure (MAP2 levels), expression of senescence (lipofuscin) or neuroinflammation (microglial Iba1) markers, activation of BDNF receptors (p-TrkB) or expression of endogenous polySia in the hippocampus of very old mice. However, cognitive improvements correlated with the normalized size of CD68+ microglial lysosomes and reduced amounts of pre- and postsynaptic proteins at these structures. Thus, our data demonstrate the potential of short polySia to reduce synaptic phagocytosis and restore key cognitive functions attenuated in aging."
"Transposable elements (TEs) have an important role in genome evolution but are challenging for bioinformatics detection due to their repetitive nature and ability to move and replicate within genomes. New sequencing technologies now enable the characterization of nucleotide and structural variations within species. Among them, TE polymorphism is critical to identify as it may influence species adaptation or trigger diseases. Despite the development of numerous bioinformatic programs, identifying the most effective tool is challenging due to non-overlapping results and varying efficiency across studies. Benchmarking efforts have highlighted some of the limitations of these tools, often evaluated on either real or simulated data. However, real data may be incomplete or contain unannotated TEs, while simulated data may not accurately reflect real genomes. This study introduces a simulation method generating data based on real genomes to control all genomic parameters. Evaluating several TE polymorphic detection tools using data from Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana, our study investigates factors like copy size, sequence divergence, and GC content that influence detection efficiency. Our results indicate that only a few programs perform satisfactorily and that all are sensitive to TE and genomic characteristics that may differ according to the species considered. Using Bos taurus population data as a case study to identify polymorphic LTR-retrotransposon insertions, we found low-frequency insertions particularly challenging to detect due to a high number of false positives. Increased sequencing coverage improved sensitivity but reduced precision. Our work underscores the importance of selecting appropriate tools and thresholds according to the specific research questions."
"The evolutionary mechanisms of cooperation are well-studied, yet what motivates individuals to cooperate remains unclear. Although conventionally associated with enhanced social tolerance (self-domestication hypothesis) and prosociality (cooperative-breeding hypothesis), individuals belonging to species that are neither self-domesticated nor cooperatively-breeding also cooperate. An overarching interdependency hypothesis posits that inter-individual dependencies promote cooperation, but comparative evidence is lacking. We experimentally studied cooperation, prosociality, and tolerance in six macaque species along a  despotic-egalitarian gradient. Within-group cooperation was higher in despotic than egalitarian societies yet restricted to few partners. Prosociality, kinship, and tolerance positively predicted cooperation success. Agent-based models consistently showed that despotic societies have fewer but more stable social bonds and, thus, higher interdependencies than egalitarian ones. Our results suggest that interdependencies facilitate the emergence and maintenance of cooperation."
"Cell migration in vivo is often guided by chemical signals. Such chemotaxis, such as performed by immune cells migrating to a wound site, is complicated by the complex geometry inside living tissues. In this study, we extend our theoretical model of branched-cell migration on a network by introducing chemokine sources to explore the cellular response. The model predicts a speed-accuracy tradeoff, whereby slow cells are significantly more accurate and able to follow efficiently a weak chemoattractant signal. We then compare the models predictions with experimental observations of neutrophils migrating to the site of laser-inflicted wound in a zebrafish larva fin, and migrating in-vitro inside a regular lattice of pillars. We find that the model captures the details of the sub-cellular response to the chemokine gradient, as well as the large-scale migration response. This comparison suggests that the neutrophils behave as fast cells, compromising their chemotaxis accuracy, which explains the functionality of these immune cells."
"Strategic behaviour in sensorimotor adaptation tasks is typically modelled either as an error minimisation process or as a process of learning through trial-and-error. The former predicts a gradual reduction in error, until some asymptote, while the latter predicts behavioural exploration to discover an efficacious solution. An alternative explanation is that a sufficiently rich understanding of the task culminates in an ""Aha!"" moment, which then allows the generation of a new solution. This predicts some period of perseveration in baseline behaviour, followed by an abrupt single-trial shift to a new strategic solution. To avoid obfuscation caused by the motor system, we investigate these hypotheses in a strategy-only aiming game, where participants aim and fire a cannon at targets. Most participants exhibited a period of baseline perseveration followed by a single-trial shift to good performance. We then applied the same analyses to reaching data from a visuomotor rotation task that inhibited implicit adaptation through delaying feedback presentation (Brudner et al., 2016). Similarly, we found that participants typically perseverated in reaching towards the target before suddenly switching, in a single trial, to good performance. These findings suggest that traditional descriptions of strategic behaviour are insufficient and must be updated if we want to understand how humans respond to sensorimotor perturbations."
"Current models of olfactory sensory processing in the olfactory bulb (OB) posit that both intra- and interglomerular inhibitory circuits are involved in transforming sensory input. However, the impact of these circuits on different olfactory receptor neuron (ORNs) inputs remains poorly understood. We generated a model of the OB input-output transformation in which the output of each glomerulus is a function of its ORN input, local feed-forward intraglomerular inhibition and interglomerular normalization in which activity of each glomerulus is divided by the population response. The output of the model included linear and non-linear concentration-response relationships that depended on the input ORN Hill coefficient and half-activation value. The concentration-response relationships could be broadly categorized into four groups based on how the output response was influenced by increasing the concentration. Increasing concentration evoked monotonic increases (I) or decreases (D) in some glomeruli. Other glomeruli responded with non-monotonic decreases then increases (DI) or increased then decreased (ID). The non-monotonic ID glomeruli required interglomerular inhibition in our model, were most common in glomeruli with higher affinity ORN input and were heterogeneous in the magnitude of their drop. In vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging from MTC glomeruli in awake mice revealed qualitatively similar response types. Increasing levels of excitation drove higher levels of suppression in subsets of glomeruli, and nearly half of the recorded MTC glomeruli could be classified as ID. Additionally, the sensitivity of individual glomeruli was significantly correlated with the degree to which it was non-monotonic. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear responses of MTC to changes in odor concentration are not unusual, but indeed are typical, and that they can be explained by intra- and interglomerular inhibition.

Key PointsO_LIWe developed a mathematical model of the olfactory bulb that incorporates feed-forward and lateral inhibition that transformed monotonic concentration-response inputs into linear and non-linear outputs that were dependent on the input Hill coefficient, half-activation value and rising inhibition.

"Lipids are essential metabolites that play critical roles in multiple cellular pathways. Like many primary metabolites, mutations that disrupt lipid synthesis can be lethal. Proteins involved in lipid synthesis, trafficking, and modification, are targets for therapeutic intervention in infectious disease and metabolic disorders. The ability to rapidly detect these proteins can accelerate their evaluation as targets for deranged lipid pathologies. However, it remains challenging to identify lipid binding motifs in proteins because the rules that govern protein engagement with specific lipids are poorly understood. As such, new bioinformatic tools that reveal conserved features in lipid binding proteins are necessary. Here, we present Structure-based Lipid-interacting Pocket Predictor (SLiPP), an algorithm that leverages machine learning to detect protein cavities capable of binding to lipids in protein structures. SLiPP uses a Random Forest classifier and operates at scale to predict lipid binding pockets with an accuracy of 96.8% and an F1 score of 86.9% when testing against a set of 8,380 pockets embedded within proteins. Our analyses revealed that the algorithm relies on hydrophobicity-related features to distinguish lipid binding pockets from those that bind to other ligands. SLiPP is fast and does not require substantial computational resources. Use of the algorithm to detect lipid binding proteins in various proteomes produced hits annotated or verified as bona fide lipid binding proteins. Additionally, SLiPP identified many new putative lipid binders in well studied proteomes. Because of its ability to identify novel lipid binding proteins, SLiPP can spur the discovery of new and ""targetable"" lipid-sensitive pathways."
"Over recent decades, the glycocalyx, an extracellular organelle comprised of a multitude of glycolipids, glycoproteins, proteoglycans and glycoRNA, has gained considerable interest in cellular biology. While research in this field has revealed its tremendous importance in evermore aspects of physiological and pathological cellular processes, many of the principles that govern the role of the glycocalyx in these processes on a molecular level are still unknown. In order to unravel the fundamental laws underlying glycocalyx function, new technologies are required that enable the distinction between individual subprocesses within the intricate environment of the glycocalyx. Here, we establish an experimental platform to investigate the dynamics of the glycocalyx at the nanometer and microsecond length and time scales in a bottom-up fashion. We synthesized defined model glycans and installed them on supported lipid bilayers, assembling glycocalyx model systems with tunable properties. By investigating these tunable model systems with interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy, we gain access to the required spatiotemporal resolution. We found a strong correlation between the molecular structure of several investigated model glycans and global dynamics of the system. Our findings are corroborated by atomistic and coarsegrained molecular dynamics simulations. Our results provide the first direct experimental evidence on the relationship between glycan structure, organization, and dynamics, offering a robust and versatile basis for a quantitative understanding of glycocalyx biology and physics at the molecular level."
"Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can cause impairments in spatial cognition and memory. The hippocampus is thought to support spatial cognition through the activity of place cells, neurons with spatial receptive fields. Coordinated firing of place cell populations is organized by different oscillatory patterns in the hippocampus during specific behavioral states. Theta rhythms organize place cell populations during awake exploration. Sharp wave-ripples organize place cell population reactivation during waking rest. Here, we examined the coordination of CA1 place cell populations during active behavior and subsequent rest in a rat model of FXS (Fmr1 knockout rats). While the organization of individual place cells by the theta rhythm was normal, the coordinated activation of sequences of place cells during individual theta cycles was impaired in Fmr1 knockout rats. Further, the subsequent replay of place cell sequences was impaired during waking rest following active exploration. Together, these results expand our understanding of how genetic modifications that model those observed in FXS affect hippocampal physiology and suggest a potential mechanism underlying impaired spatial cognition in FXS.

Significance StatementFragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can cause impaired memory and atypical spatial behaviors such as ""elopement"" (i.e., wandering off and becoming lost). Activity in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus supports spatial memory and spatial cognition, making it an important candidate to study in the context of FXS; however, how neuronal population activity in CA1 is affected by FXS is poorly understood. In this study, we found that the coordination of populations of CA1 neurons during active behavior and waking rest was impaired in a rat model of FXS. These results reveal hippocampal physiological deficits that may contribute to cognitive impairments in FXS."
"BackgroundThe vertebrate nervous system is vulnerable to chemical toxicity and the widespread release of chemicals into the environment outstrips the capacity to assess their safety. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a powerful vertebrate model that can bridge the gap between in vitro and mammalian-based in vivo studies. However, the behavior-rich repertoire of larval zebrafish, a 3R-compliant model amenable to higher-throughput chemical screens, has yet to be fully deployed to identify and characterize chemical compounds that cause neurotoxicity.

ObjectiveWe sought to establish a multi-behavioral phenotyping approach in larval zebrafish to identify and mechanistically elucidate neuroactive chemicals, with particular focus on chemical compounds that affect non-associative habituation learning.

MethodsWe devised a battery of automated behavior assays in larval zebrafish. The battery captures stereotypical visual and acoustic behaviors including habituation, a form of non-associative learning. To elucidate mechanisms underlying exposure-induced behavioral alterations in zebrafish, in silico target predictions, pharmacological interventions, patch-clamp recordings in cultured mouse cortical neurons, and human multi-neurotransmitter (hMNR) assay in 3D BrainSpheres were used.

ResultsKnown pharmacological modulators of habituation in zebrafish evoked distinct behavioral patterns. By screening chemicals positive for ex vivo N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) modulation, we identified chlorophene, a biocide that caused sedation, paradoxical excitation, and reduced habituation in zebrafish. Using in silico target predictions and pharmacological interventions, we discovered that chlorophene acts via gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors (GABAARs), a previously unknown target site. Orthogonal validation in cultured mouse cortical neurons and human stem cell-derived BrainSpheres confirmed chlorophenes interaction with GABAARs. Chlorophenes behavioral profile resembled that of flupirtine, a Kv7 potassium channel (M-current) activator, suggesting that habituation deficits stem from M-current rather than GABAAR modulation.

ConclusionsThese studies combined a series of behavior assays in a phenotypically rich, rapid, and inexpensive non-mammalian vertebrate test system to screen chemicals for neurotoxicity. Together with in silico target predictions and mouse- and human-based models, our findings establish multi-behavioral phenotyping in zebrafish as a powerful toolkit for neurotoxicity testing and mechanism identification, with relevance for humans."
"Our previous research suggested that mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)/blood-testis barrier (BTB) mechanism is involved in the regulation of the rates of epigenetic aging of sperm, where increased activity of mTORC1 opens BTB and accelerates epigenetic aging and increased activity of mTORC2 produces opposite results - increases BTB integrity and rejuvenates sperm epigenome. In the present study, we use our newly developed epigenetic clock model to investigate whether the mTOR/BTB mechanism is involved in the epigenetic reprogramming of sperm in mice exposed to heat stress (HS) and cadmium (Cd). Our findings show that both mTOR-dependent BTB disruption caused by HS and mTOR-independent BTB disruption due to Cd exposure accelerate sperm epigenetic aging, resulting in similar changes to sperm DNA methylation patterns. These results suggest that the mTOR/BTB mechanism is a novel molecular pathway through which environmental stressors influence sperm epigenetic aging, and this pathway may be relevant to a broad range of factors, including environmental, lifestyle, dietary, and health influences."
"The comprehensive interpretation of behavior from incomplete data represents a fundamental challenge in computational ethology. Here we present Masked Autoencoder for Transformer-based Estimation and Reconstruction (MATER), a self-supervised learning framework that extracts behaviorally relevant representations from unlabeled rodent pose data by reconstructing strategically masked body keypoints. This approach captures fundamental movement patterns without requiring extensive manual annotation, addressing common experimental challenges including occlusions during social interactions and tracking errors. We evaluate MATER across two-dimensional and three-dimensional rodent pose datasets, demonstrating its robustness under high levels of keypoint masking. The framework achieves high-fidelity reconstructions under these challenging conditions and produces latent representations that support accurate behavioral classification with minimal supervision. Our analyses further reveal that rodent movement exhibits intrinsic spatiotemporal structure, which can be computationally inferred without explicit labeling. Reconstruction performance is tightly linked to the temporal coherence of movement, highlighting the importance of temporal dynamics in behavioral representation. These findings reinforce the emerging view that animal behavior is hierarchically organized and governed by natural temporal dependencies. MATER offers a robust, scalable tool for neuroscientists seeking to analyze complex, naturalistic behaviors across diverse experimental contexts, ultimately advancing our understanding of behavioral architecture and its neural underpinnings."
"Intentional use of a single finger results in involuntary forces and movements among other fingers. Constraints to finger independence are attributed to both neural and mechanical factors, but the contribution of these factors is debated. We hypothesized that neural factors primarily constrain finger independence during isometric exertions whereas mechanical factors impose larger constraints during movements. We investigated changes in finger independence following a ring finger fatigue protocol. We assumed that with fatigue, the ability to actively transmit forces across fingers through neural pathways will be reduced but force transmission passively through mechanical pathways will remain unaffected. Participants performed isometric finger contractions and flexion-extension movements at baseline and following a ring finger fatigue protocol. At baseline, involuntary ring finger forces ranged from 7.3-16.5% MVC. Consistent with our predictions, involuntary ring finger forces decreased by 2.5-8.9% MVC following fatigue. In contrast, involuntary ring finger movement did not change or surprisingly in several cases, increased by greater than 10-20{degrees} following fatigue relative to baseline across movement tasks. Our findings demonstrate that the neuromechanical control of finger force versus motion are distinct from each other and can alter the constraints to finger independence in a task-dependent way."
"Widespread resistance to all clinically used antibiotics has sparked investigations into alternative sources for novel and effective antimicrobial agents. Metal-based compounds (metalloantibiotics) have emerged as a promising class of potential antibiotics exhibiting high hit rates against critical bacterial pathogens while not displaying higher toxicity than organic compounds. Here, we describe the exploration of a novel class of non-toxic, Gram-positive acting platinum-based antibacterial agents with micro to nanomolar activity against a range of methicillin and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed that modifications of the core scaffold result in reduced antibacterial activity. Mode of action studies investigations showed that lead compound Pt1 did not impair cell division, RNA, protein, or cell wall synthesis, nor did it affect membrane integrity or potential. Instead, akin to the structurally similar anticancer drug cisplatin (CisPt), Pt1 treatment resulted in reduced DNA staining, visible nucleoid compaction, and activation of DNA damage repair responses. Importantly, we could show that Pt1 is able to interact with and damage DNA directly, resulting in DNA strand breaks and fragmentation. Pt1 activity can be reduced significantly by high amounts of a hydroxyl radical scavenger. Derivative Pt8, which retained DNA-damaging activity but was less potent in terms of antibacterial activity, was not affected by the presence of radical scavengers, suggesting that Pt1 possesses a multimodal mechanism. In line with this observation, no resistance development to Pt1 was observed over the course of 36 passages. Finally, we could demonstrate the in vivo activity of Pt1, which significantly reduced the bacterial load in a murine S. aureus skin infection model. Altogether, these findings shed light on the SAR and antibacterial mode of action of a novel class of platinum metalloantibiotics, validate its in vivo efficacy, and pave the way for further exploration of platinum compounds as novel drug candidates with a highly attractive activity profile."
"p53 is a tumor suppressor protein with multiple isoforms with shared or specific functions. However, two of its isoforms, {Delta}133p53 and {Delta}160p53, with large N-terminal deletions, can cause cancer. These isoforms exert a dominant-negative effect on full-length p53 (FLp53), although the precise molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of action of {Delta}133p53 and {Delta}160p53 isoforms using chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase expression, subcellular fractionation, immunofluorescence assays, and apoptotic caspase activity assay. Our study elucidates that these DNA-binding deficient p53 isoforms form hetero-tetrameric complexes with FLp53 and disrupt FLp53s DNA binding and transcriptional activities when present in a higher proportion than FLp53 in the tetramer. However, these structurally unstable isoforms promote vigorous protein aggregation involving FLp53, disrupting its structure and sequestering it in the cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates, thereby limiting its availability to function as a transcription activator protein. Thus, co-aggregation of {Delta}133p53 and {Delta}160p53 with FLp53, rather than hetero-tetramerization, is likely the primary factor contributing to their dominant-negative effect. Modulating the stability and aggregation of p53 isoforms could be a novel strategy for cancer therapy."
"SummaryNonribosomal peptides (NRPs) are medically important natural compounds. Linking biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding NRP synthesis in microbial genomes to their final products is challenging due to the modularity, promiscuity, and post-synthesis modifications that contribute to NRP diversity. Here, we present Nerpa 2, a major update to our previous tool for linking computationally predicted BGCs to a database of known NRP chemical structures. Nerpa 2 incorporates substantial software and algorithmic improvements, including a new probabilistic alignment and scoring model. These advancements, combined with an extended training dataset, significantly improve the tools accuracy and sensitivity. With its comprehensive and user-friendly HTML reports, Nerpa 2 is a powerful addition to the natural product research toolkit, accelerating NRP discovery.

"ImportanceNumerous studies indicate that the traditional categorical classification of severe mental disorders (SMD), such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and major depressive disorders, does not align with the underlying biology of those disorders as they frequently overlap in terms of symptoms and risk factors.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to identify transdiagnostic patient clusters based on disease severity and explore the underlying biological mechanisms independently of the traditional categorical classification.

DesignWe utilized data from 443 participants diagnosed with SMD of the PsyCourse Study, a longitudinal study with deep phenotyping across up to four visits. We performed longitudinal clustering to group patients based on symptom trajectories and cognitive performance. The resulting clusters were compared on cross-sectional variables, including independent measures of severity as well as polygenic risk scores, serum protein quantification, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation.

ResultsWe identified two distinct clusters of patients that exhibited marked differences in illness severity but did not differ significantly in age, sex, or diagnostic proportions. We found 19 serum proteins significantly dysregulated between the two clusters. Functional enrichment pointed to a convergence of immune system dysregulation and neurodevelopmental processes.

ConclusionThe observed differences in serum protein expression suggest that disease severity is associated with the convergence of immune system dysregulation and neurodevelopmental alterations, particularly involving pathways related to inflammation and brain plasticity. The identification of pro-inflammatory proteins among the differentially expressed markers underscores the potential role of systemic inflammation in the pathophysiology of SMD. These results highlight the importance of considering illness severity as a core dimension in psychiatric research and clinical practice and suggest that targeting immune-related mechanisms may offer promising new therapeutic avenues for patients with SMD.

Key points

QuestionCan analyzing symptom trajectories and cognitive profiles across diagnostic categories reveal clinically relevant subgroups in severe mental disorders?

FindingsIn this longitudinal study of 443 individuals with severe mental disorders, two distinct clusters emerged, differing significantly in illness severity, with the more severe group displaying elevated pro-inflammatory serum proteins, suggesting an association between disease severity and inflammation.

MeaningThese findings suggest that transdiagnostic clustering clarifies shared mechanisms, underscores the importance of inflammation in severe mental disorders, and highlights a promising avenue for novel therapeutic approaches."
"BackgroundIn breeding the aim is to identify and accumulate beneficial variants. However, detection of these variants may be challenging in the presence of extensive genotype x environment interactions (GxE), as variant effects will be conditional on environment.

MethodsThe study assesses the performance of 264 diploid perennial ryegrass accessions in a multi-environment field trial. We investigate the extent of GxE, for yield (total dry matter) and persistence traits, i.e. winter kill and spring cover, under environmental conditions experienced in Nordic and Baltic regions at the limit of the species distribution. Two different approaches to modelling GxE were tested: reaction norm and envirotyping, and the models were validated under three different breeding scenarios.

ResultsOur analysis documented the presence of significant GxE interaction for all traits investigated in the study. Validation showed improvements in prediction accuracy when accounting for GxE: up to 4% for yield when predicting in unobserved environments, and up to 22% and 9% for spring cover and winter kill, respectively when predicting unobserved germplasm. Genome-wide-association-studies (GWAS) were utilized to detect genetic variants with marginal effects (environment-independent effect) and conditional effects (environment-dependent effects). Results showed the presence of large-effect genetic variants with marginal effects, in addition to few QTL whose effects were adaptive under specific environmental conditions while neutral or deleterious under different environmental conditions.

ConclusionThis study demonstrates the usefulness and limitations of genomic prediction models for predicting GxE in highly diverse samples, and describes the extent of GxE interactions at the limit of species distribution for perennial ryegrass. Finally, our study points toward adaptive variation, which may enhance persistence of perennial ryegrass populations in Nordic and Baltic growing conditions."
"The ENCODE project has revolutionized our understanding of functional genomic elements, yet its exhaustive approach remains inaccessible to smaller communities studying non-model organisms. To address this challenge, we developed the miniENCODE framework -a resource-efficient strategy combining carefully selected experimental assays with an integrated computational platform. Using zebrafish as a model, we implemented this framework through three core assays: RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and H3K27ac CUT&Tag, spanning six developmental stages and 11 adult tissues. Our analysis identified 52,350 candidate enhancer-like signatures, characterized their spatiotemporal activity patterns, and experimentally validated tissue-specific enhancers. We developed the mini Omics Data Portal (miniODP) to facilitate multi-omics data reuse, integration, visualization, and analysis. Through this platform, we characterized key transcription factors and their regulatory networks in various developmental stages and adult tissues. Extending this approach to additional model organisms (cattle, lancelet, Mexican tetra, and polyp), we demonstrated its broad applicability for understanding gene regulation in diverse species. The miniENCODE framework provides a practical solution for comprehensive regulatory element characterization, enabling smaller research communities to advance genomic studies in understudied organisms without overextending their resources. This approach not only provides a valuable resource for zebrafish but also establishes a scalable model for accelerating genomic research in diverse species."
"Nuclear shape observed after the forced expression of mouse or human Protamine 1 (PRM1) in fibroblasts led us to propose the hypothesis that PRM1 sequence plays an important role in imposing the overall shape of the protaminized nucleus. Comparison of mouse and human PRM1 sequence pointed to cysteines 15 and 29 as potential critical residues in the mouse PRM1 sequence inducing the characteristic mouse ""hooked"" nuclear sperm shape. To explore this idea, mice with mutations in PRM1 Cys15 and Cys29 were generated. These mice remained fertile with no significant changes in sperm count or protamine expression levels. However, modifications in sperm head shape were observed. Transmission electron microscopy revealed disrupted chromatin condensation in mutant sperm, with several morphological changes and a remarkable increase in histone retention. Overall, the findings suggest that species-specific PRM1 cysteine residue positions are crucial for nuclear shape determination and histone retention in spermatozoa."
"Extra-retinal photoreception is widely observed across vertebrates, facilitating species-specific regulation of physiological and behavioral responses to diverse photic environments. Yet, the roles of non-visual opsins remain poorly understood, as their distribution and function have not yet been systematically investigated. This study provides the first comprehensive evidence of non-visual opsin expression across the reptile body. Using predicted sequences for extra-retinal photoreceptors, non-visual opsins were confirmed in the brain, eye, testes, liver, and skin. Specifically, OPN3 (encephalopsin) exhibited the highest expression across all tissues, particularly in the testes, corroborating findings in mammals. OPN5 (neuropsin) was detected predominantly in the testes, marking the first such report in reptiles. Moderate expression of OPN4 (melanopsin) in the brain and eye supports its roles in both visual and deep-brain photoreception. In the skin, a distinct pattern of higher opsin expression was observed in the dorsal skin compared to ventral skin. OPN3-3 was most abundant and exhibited a unique expression profile, potentially linking opsins to light-mediated processes influencing chromatophore-driven color changes. Findings from this research provide a critical evolutionary context for understanding the role and conservation of non-visual opsins in reptiles and their relevance to vertebrate lineages, including mammals and birds."
"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematological malignancy that has poor prognosis and high relapse rates with cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. Previously, we identified modulators of mitochondrial function, PS127-family compounds, that were cytotoxic to AML and were characterized by two predicted functions: apoptotic agonism and thioredoxin/glutathione reductase inhibition (T/GRi). Here, we uncovered a third critical predicted function: autophagic induction. A cheminformatics screening of [~]4.2 million compounds for molecules with high probability of these three functions yielded 93 hits, 81 of which were closely related to PS127-family molecules. In silico hits selected for validation selectively killed AML cells, activated apoptosis, required functional autophagy, and interfered with glutathione metabolism, confirming predicted functions. This increased pools of cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS and decreased oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis. Differential scanning fluorimetry implicated glutathione reductase as a direct target of these molecules. Structurally-unrelated compounds from different clusters caused the same phenotype, validating our structure-blind screening approach. Furthermore, strong synergy between these compounds and the AML treatment midostaurin underscores their therapeutic potential."
"Perceptual inference requires the integration of visual features through recurrent processing, the dynamic exchange of information between higher and lower level cortical regions. While animal research has demonstrated a crucial role of NMDA receptors in recurrent processing, establishing a causal link between NMDA receptors and recurrent processing in humans has remained challenging. Here, we report two pharmacological studies with randomized, double-blind, crossover designs in which we administered the NMDA antagonist memantine, while collecting human electroencephalography (EEG). We trained and tested EEG classifiers to reflect the processing of specific stimulus features with increasing levels of complexity, namely differences in stimulus contrast, collinearity between local line elements, and illusory surfaces of a Kanizsa triangle. In two experiments involving different participants and visual tasks, we found that memantine selectively improved decoding of the Kanizsa illusion, known to depend on recurrent processing, while leaving decoding of contrast and collinearity largely unaffected. Interestingly, the results from an attentional blink (experiment 1) and task-relevance manipulation (experiment 2) showed that memantine was only effective when the stimulus was attended and consciously accessed. These findings suggest that NMDA inhibition through memantine enhances recurrent processing, especially for attended objects, and thereby provide a crucial step toward bridging animal and human research, shedding light on the neural mechanisms underpinning perceptual inference and conscious perception.

This research was supported by a grant from the H2020 European Research Council (ERC STG 715605, SVG)."
"Proteolytic cleavage of proglucagon by prohormone convertase 2 (PC2) is required for islet  cells to generate glucagon. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unclear. Here, we report that SEL1L-HRD1 endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD), a highly conserved protein quality control system responsible for clearing misfolded proteins from the ER, plays a key role in glucagon production by regulating turnover of the nascent proform of the PC2 enzyme (proPC2). Using a mouse model with SEL1L deletion in proglucagon-expressing cells, we observed a progressive decline in stimulated glucagon secretion and a reduction in pancreatic glucagon content. Mechanistically, we found that endogenous proPC2 is a substrate of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD, and that degradation of misfolded proPC2 ensures the maturation of activation-competent proPC2 protein. These findings identify ERAD as a novel regulator of PC2 biology and an essential mechanism for maintaining  cell function."
"Impaired GABAergic inhibition, so-called neural disinhibition, in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus has been linked to cognitive deficits. The novel object recognition (NOR) task has been used widely to study cognitive deficits in rodents. However, the contribution of prefrontal cortex and hippocampal GABAergic inhibition to NOR task performance has not been established. Here, we investigated NOR task performance in male Lister Hooded rats following regional neural disinhibition or functional inhibition, using intra-cerebral microinfusion of the GABA-A receptor antagonist picrotoxin or agonist muscimol, respectively. Our infusion targets were the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dorsal hippocampus and ventral hippocampus. Using a within-subjects design, we compared NOR task performance (1-min retention delay) following bilateral regional saline, picrotoxin or muscimol infusions made before the acquisition phase. In mPFC, neither functional inhibition nor neural disinhibition affected object recognition memory. However, in both dorsal and ventral hippocampus, neural disinhibition impaired NOR relative to saline control, mainly by reducing novel object exploration time. In addition, functional inhibition of dorsal hippocampus impaired NOR, whereas ventral hippocampal functional inhibition tended to reduce novel object exploration at the highest dose used (alongside substantial non-specific behavioural effects). Overall, our data suggest that hippocampal, but not prefrontal, GABAergic inhibition contributes to NOR at a 1-min retention delay. Moreover, such NOR performance likely requires balanced neural activity in the dorsal hippocampus, with both too little and too much dorsal hippocampal activity impairing NOR memory. Our findings support that the NOR task can be used to investigate hippocampal GABAergic dysfunction in rodent models.

Significance statementImpaired GABAergic neural inhibition in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus has emerged as a key neuropathological feature of cognitive disorders. The novel object recognition (NOR) task is used widely in rodent models to investigate cognitive impairments relevant to cognitive disorders. However, the role of hippocampal and prefrontal GABAergic inhibition in NOR is unclear, limiting interpretations as to how NOR deficits in rodent models may relate to this key pathological feature of many cognitive disorders. Here, we show that impaired hippocampal GABAergic inhibition impairs NOR in rats, whereas prefrontal GABAergic inhibition is not required. Thus, the NOR task may be used to investigate hippocampal GABAergic dysfunction in rodent models."
"Understanding how graphene oxide (GO) interacts with cells is crucial for its safe and efficient biomedical applications. Despite extensive research, a systematic investigation using a panel of cell lines, thoroughly characterized label-free nanomaterials, and complementary analytical techniques is lacking. Here, we examined the uptake of thin GO sheets with distinct lateral dimensions in 13 cell lines: 8 cancer (HeLa, A549, PC3, DU-145, LNCaP, SW-480, SH-SY5Y, U87-MG) and 5 non-cancer (BEAS-2B, NIH/3T3, PNT-2, HaCaT, 293T), using confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and flow cytometry. Our results reveal a striking difference in GO uptake: non-cancer cells internalized GO efficiently, while in cancer cells, GO predominantly interacted with the plasma membrane, showing minimal to no internalization. Comparison to other nanomaterials (polystyrene beads and graphene flakes) confirmed that cancer cells internalize materials similarly to non-cancer cells, indicating GO-specific interactions. We identified that GO thickness plays a pivotal role in this differential uptake. Additionally, GO disrupted the actin cytoskeleton, impairing migration in cancer but not in non-cancer cells. We propose that thin GO sheets act as a cue upon interaction with the plasma membrane of cancer cell lines, subsequently inducing actin filaments disruption leading to impaired endocytosis, migration activity, and reduced capacity of cancer cells towards GO uptake."
"The three-dimensional (3D) architecture of the genome plays a crucial role in gene regulation and various human diseases. Short-read sequencing methods for measuring 3D genome organization are powerful, but they lack the ability to resolve individual human haplotypes or structurally complex regions. To address this, we present FiberFold, a deep learning model that combines convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures to accurately predict cell-type-specific and haplotype-specific 3D genome organization using multi-omic data from a single, long-read sequencing assay, Fiber-seq. By applying FiberFold to a cell line with allelic X-inactivation, we show that Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) are attenuated on the inactive chrX. Furthermore, FiberFold predicts significant changes to TADs surrounding a 13;X balanced translocation in a patient with a rare Mendelian disease. FiberFold showcases the power of integrating long-read epigenomic sequencing with deep learning tools to investigate fundamental chromatin biology as well as the molecular basis of human disease."
"Alcohol abuse is a leading cause of preventable deaths, affecting brain function and metabolism, including GABA transmission and vitamin B6 (VB6) levels. However, the interaction between genetic VB6 deficiency and alcohol consumption remains unexplored. Here, we utilized Drosophila models with mutations in pyridox(am)ine-5-phosphate oxidase (PNPO), a key enzyme in VB6 metabolism, to examine this interaction at behavioral and biochemical levels. Our findings demonstrate that PNPO deficiency reduces alcohol aversion, increases consumption, and alters locomotor behavior. Biochemically, PNPO deficiency and alcohol exposure converge on amino acid metabolism, elevating inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and glycine. Moreover, both PNPO deficiency and alcohol exposure lead to lethality with significant interaction, which can be rescued by VB6 supplementation. These results highlight a functional interaction between genetic VB6 deficiency and alcohol, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for alcohol-related behaviors."
"Linear growth stunting due to undernutrition affects 20% of children under the age of five with far-reaching consequences, including increased susceptibility to infection and altered cognitive development. Current nutritional interventions are largely ineffective in rescuing linear growth. A significant proportion of stunting originates in utero; however, the mechanisms by which maternal undernutrition is transmitted between generations remain poorly characterized. Here we employed a gnotobiotic murine model of intergenerational undernutrition in which offspring are exposed to distinct microbial communities both in utero and after birth. We found that maternal undernutrition exacerbated offspring growth deficits in a microbiota-dependent manner. Maternal undernutrition also altered the offspring microbiome, increasing abundance of Enterococcus species and Escherichia coli. Cross-fostering demonstrated critical roles for the microbiota in growth during both gestation and early life. These findings emphasize the need to target both mother and child in the design of nutritional therapies for undernutrition."
"Given sustainability and scalability concerns of using sugar feedstocks for microbial bioproduction of bulk chemicals, widening the feedstock range for microbial cell factories is of high interest. Methanol is a one-carbon alcohol that stands out as an alternative feedstock for the bioproduction of chemicals, as it is electron-rich, water-miscible and can be produced from several renewable resources. Bioconversion of methanol into products under thermophilic conditions (>50C) could be highly advantageous for industrial biotechnology. Although progress is being made with natural, thermophilic methylotrophic microorganisms, they are not yet optimal for bioproduction and establishing alternative thermophilic methylotrophic bioproduction platforms can widen possibilities. Hence, we set out to implement synthetic methanol assimilation in the emerging thermophilic model organism Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius. We engineered P. thermoglucosidasius to be strictly dependent for its growth on methanol assimilation via the core of the highly efficient ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) cycle, while co-assimilating ribose. Surprisingly, this did not require heterologous expression of RuMP enzymes. Instead, by laboratory evolution we awakened latent, native enzyme activities to form the core of the RuMP cycle. We obtained fast methylotrophic growth in which ~17% of biomass was strictly obtained from methanol. This work lays the foundation for developing a versatile thermophilic bioproduction platform based on renewable methanol."
"Damaged mitochondria can be cleared from the cell by mitophagy, using a pathway formed by the recessive Parkinsons disease genes PINK1 and Parkin. How mitochondrial damage is sensed by the PINK1-Parkin pathway, however, remains uncertain. Here, using a Parkin substrate-based reporter in genome-wide screens, we identified that diverse forms of mitochondrial damage converge on loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) to activate PINK1. Consistently, the MMP but not the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) import motor provided the essential driving force for endogenous PINK1 import through the inner membrane translocase TIM23. In the absence of TIM23, PINK1 arrested in the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) during import. The energy-state outside of the mitochondria further modulated the pathway by controlling the rate of new PINK1 synthesis. Our results identify separation of PINK1 from TOM by the MMP, as the key damage-sensing switch in the PINK1-Parkin mitophagy pathway.

HighlightsO_LIMFN2-Halo is a quantitative single-cell reporter of PINK1-Parkin activation.
C_LIO_LIDiverse forms of mitochondrial damage, identified in whole-genome screens, activate the PINK1-Parkin pathway by disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP).
C_LIO_LIThe primary driving force for endogenous PINK1 import through the TIM23 translocase is the MMP with the PAM import motor playing a supporting role.

"Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) and immune cell diversification play a central role in driving atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD)1-3. However, the molecular mechanisms governing cell state transitions within the neo-intima in human CAD remain poorly understood, and no lipid-independent therapies are currently approved for its treatment. Here, we performed multi-omic single-cell gene expression profiling, epitope mapping, and spatial transcriptomics from 27 human coronary arteries. Our analysis identified fibroblast activation protein (FAP) as a marker of modulated VSMCs within the neo-intima. Genetic lineage tracing in mice confirmed that FAP cells in the plaque originate from medial VSMCs. Additionally, non-invasive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in patients with CAD revealed focal FAP uptake in atherosclerotic lesions. Spatial transcriptomics further delineated the distinct localization of VSMC and immune cell subsets within plaques, with FAP states enriched in the neo-intima. To explore the therapeutic potential of targeting de-differentiated VSMCs, we developed an anti-FAP bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) and demonstrated that it significantly reduced the plaque burden in multiple mouse models of atherosclerosis. Collectively, our study provides the first single-cell and spatially resolved map of human CAD, establishes FAP as a marker of modulated smooth muscle cells, and demonstrates the broader potential of immunotherapeutics for lipid independent targets in atherosclerotic CAD."
"Myosin II is the molecular motor responsible for muscle contraction. Myosin II hydrolyses ATP into Pi and ADP, to convert chemical energy into mechanical work while attached to actin filaments. The relation between force generation and Pi release remains unclear. Many studies use chemical substances, such as blebbistatin, to study the transitions during actomyosin interactions. Blebbistatin and its derivatives selectively inhibit the actin-activated ATPase of myosin II, accumulating myosin cross-bridges in a pre-power-stroke state. Although the effects of blebbistatin have been explored, it is still unclear how blebbistatin affects force generation and the velocity of contraction. In this study, we used individual myofibrils, myosin and actin filaments, and isolated heavy meromyosin (HMM) and actin filaments to characterize the effects of blebbistatin. We observed that increasing concentrations of blebbistatin (i) decreased the force produced by myofibrils and isolated myosin filaments, (ii) decreased the maximum velocity of shortening produced by myofibrils and the myosin-induced actin sliding velocity, (iii) decreased the curvature of the force-velocity relation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, UV radiation reduced the effect of blebbistatin, which was partially reversed if blebbistatin was bound to myosin before exposure to UV light. These results show that blebbistatin alters force and velocity generation at the molecular, myofilamentous and myofibrillar levels. This study has interesting implications in fields which rely on using blebbistatin to study cellular processes and confirms several results published in different experimental arrangements. Thus, this study is exploratory and confirmatory, and the findings have utility surrounding cell migration, muscle biophysics, cellular reproduction, or any processes that rely on the action of myosin II."
"Naturally competent bacteria can be engineered into platforms for detecting environmental DNA. This capability could be used to monitor the spread of pathogens, invasive species, and resistance genes, among other applications. Here, we create Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1-ISx biosensors that detect specific target DNA sequences through natural transformation. We tested strains with DNA sensors that consisted of either a mutated antibiotic resistance gene (TEM-1 bla or nptII) or a counterselectable gene flanked by sequences from the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which causes white-nose syndrome in bats. Upon uptake of homologous DNA, recombination restored antibiotic resistance gene function or removed the counterselectable gene, enabling selection of cells that sensed the target DNA. The antibiotic resistance gene and P. destructans biosensors could detect as few as 3,000 or 5,000,000 molecules of their DNA targets, respectively, and their sensitivity was not affected by excess off-target DNA. These results demonstrate how A. baylyi can be reprogrammed into a modular platform for monitoring environmental DNA."
"The utility of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is greatly enhanced by the ability to introduce precise, site-specific genetic modifications with minimal off-target effects. Although Cas9 endonuclease is an exceptionally efficient gene-editing tool, its propensity for generating biallelic modifications often limits its capacity for introducing heterozygous variants. Here, we use prime editing (PE) to install heterozygous edits in over ten distinct genetic loci, achieving knock-in efficiencies of up to 40% without the need for subsequent purification or drug selection steps. Moreover, PE enables the precise introduction of heterozygous edits in paralogous genes that are otherwise extremely challenging to achieve using endonuclease-based editing approaches. We also show that PE can be successfully combined with reprogramming to derive heterozygous iPSC clones directly from human fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our findings highlight the utility of PE for generating hPSCs with complex edits and represents a powerful platform for modelling disease-associated dominant mutations and gene-dosage effects in an entirely isogenic context."
"Africa has a uniquely rich cattle diversity of [~]150 breeds comprising the Bos taurus indicus sub-species, Bos taurus taurus, and their crosses. These represent [~]23% of the global cattle population. However, high quality, representative assemblies are limited for African cattle and especially for indicine breeds. Here we built high quality de novo assemblies for five important African indigenous cattle breeds using PacBio HiFi sequencing: Lagune (Bos taurus taurus), Gudali, Iringa Red and Singida White (Bos taurus indicus), and Mpwapwa (Bos taurus taurus x Bos taurus indicus). These new assemblies are the most contiguous and complete African cattle assemblies produced so far, with genome sizes of 3.25 - 3.36Gb, contiguity N50s ranging from 83.59Mb to 97.87Mb and scaffold N50s from 100.30Mb to 113.37Mb. BUSCO genome completeness scores were also higher than 99.68%, indicative of highly contiguous assemblies. These improved and highly contiguous genome assemblies are consequently a valuable resource for future African and global livestock genomic studies."
"T cells play a crucial role in the adaptive immune system and depend on tightly regulated intracellular signalling pathways to respond in an appropriate manner. Adapter proteins have flexible and dynamic features, which allow them to regulate T cell signal transduction pathways. As adapter proteins are enzymatically inert and may play multiple roles in parallel, it has been a challenge to fully characterise their functions individually. One such protein in T cells, is T cell specific adapter protein (TSAd), which is upregulated following T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and is believed to mediate Src family tyrosine kinase signalling. However, the functional role remains elusive, possibly due to limited insight into interactors that potentially bind TSAd. The only structurally well-defined feature within TSAd, is the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. This conserved domain displays prototypic binding of phosphorylated tyrosines, which suggests that the adapter molecule is implicated in phosphotyrosine signalling pathways. Here, we used an unbiased approach to identify ligands of the TSAd SH2 domain, by using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS). Several novel ligands, many of which are known to be implicated in negative regulation of T cell intracellular signalling, were identified. More specifically, we showed that TSAd binds DOK2 and PTPN11 and determined the tyrosines responsible for the TSAd SH2 domain-dependent interaction. Ablation of TSAd and DOK2 by CRISPR/Cas9 in Jurkat T cells resulted in altered tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings provide new insight into the possible function of TSAd as a negative signalling node in T cells."
"Accurate cell segmentation is an essential step in the quantitative analysis of fluorescence microscopy images. Pre-trained deep learning models for automatic cell segmentation, such as Cellpose, offer strong performance across a variety of biological datasets but may still introduce segmentation errors. While training custom models can improve accuracy, it often requires programming expertise and significant time, limiting the accessibility of automatic cell segmentation for many wet lab researchers. To address this gap, we developed ""Toggle-Untoggle"", a desktop application that combines automated segmentation using the Cellpose ""cyto3"" model with a user-friendly graphical interface for intuitive segmentation quality control. Our app allows users to refine results by interactively toggling individual segmented cells on or off without the need to manually edit segmentation masks, and to export morphological data and cell outlines for downstream analysis. Here we demonstrate the utility of ""Toggle-Untoggle"" in enabling accurate, efficient single-cell analysis on real-world fluorescence microscopy data, with no coding skills required."
"BackgroundChronic methamphetamine abuse leads to cognitive decline, posing a significant threat to human health and contributing to productivity loss. However, the intricate and multifaceted mechanisms underlying methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity have impeded the development of effective therapeutic interventions.

MethodsTo establish a mouse model of cognitive decline induced by chronic methamphetamine exposure, we employed a large sample size and conducted two behavioral tests (Y-maze and novel object recognition test) at 2 and 4 weeks post-exposure. Subsequently, single-cell RNA sequencing was utilized to delineate the mRNA expression profiles of individual cells within the hippocampus.

Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses, including cell clustering and identification, differential gene expression analysis, cellular communication analysis, pseudotemporal trajectory analysis, and transcription factor regulation analysis, were performed to elucidate the cellular-level changes in mRNA profiles caused by chronic methamphetamine exposure.

ResultsOur findings demonstrated impairments in working memory, spatial cognition, learning, and cognitive memory. Through single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified diverse cell types in the hippocampi of mice after 4 weeks of behavioral testing, including neuroglial cells, stromal cells, vascular cells, and immune cells. We observed that methamphetamine exerted cell-specific effects on gene expression changes associated with neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, neuronal support dysfunction, and immune dysregulation. Furthermore, cross-talk analysis revealed extensive alterations in cellular communication patterns and signal changes within the hippocampal microenvironment induced by methamphetamine exposure. Pseudotime analysis predicted hippocampal neurogenesis disorders and identified key regulatory genes implicated in chronic methamphetamine abuse. Transcription factor analysis uncovered regulators and pathways linked to astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation, endothelial junction integrity, microglial synaptic remodeling, and oligodendrocyte-supported neuronal cell bodies and axons. Additionally, it highlighted the role of neural precursor cells in various forms of neurodegeneration.

ConclusionsThis study establishes a robust mouse model of cognitive impairment induced by chronic methamphetamine exposure. It provides valuable biological insights, characterizes the single-cell atlas of the hippocampus, and offers novel directions for investigating neurological damage associated with chronic methamphetamine-induced cognitive decline."
"1.Accurate nucleotide variant calling is essential in microbial genomics, particularly for outbreak tracking and phylogenetics. This study evaluates variant calls derived from genome assemblies compared to traditional read-based variant-calling methods, using seven closely related Staphylococcus aureus isolates sequenced on Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms. By benchmarking multiple assembly and variant-calling pipelines against a ground truth dataset, we found that read-based methods consistently achieved high accuracy. Assembly-based approaches performed well in some cases but were highly dependent on assembly quality, as errors in the assembly led to false-positive variant calls. These findings underscore the need for improved assembly techniques before the potential benefits of assembly-based variant calling - such as reduced computational requirements and simpler data management - can be realised.

2. Impact statementVariant calling is foundational to microbial genomics, yet traditional workflows rely heavily on sequencing reads, which for a typical bacterial genome can be hundreds of megabytes. In contrast, genome assemblies are far smaller - usually just a few megabytes - making them significantly easier to manage. If accurate variant calls could be made directly from assemblies, this would reduce computational demands and, in some cases, may even eliminate the need to retain raw sequencing reads. This study addresses the key question of whether variant calling from assemblies is accurate enough to replace read-based methods. Our findings show that while assembly-based variant calling can achieve high accuracy, this is only possible with error-free assemblies. Since most assemblies contain errors, assembly-based variant-calling approaches should currently be used with caution. Nevertheless, as sequencing and assembly technologies continue to advance, improved assembly accuracy may make assembly-based variant calling a viable alternative, reducing data complexity and storage demands while streamlining microbial genomic analyses.

"This paper discloses technical details of an early approach we explored for molecular glue induced ternary complex structure prediction using Feynman-Kac (FK) steering in the diffusion modules of AlphaFold3-type models. While we recently reported the successful results of our YDS-GlueFold model in predicting 8 novel molecular glue induced ternary structures validated by experimental data, here we share insights from our earlier FK steering experiments which were conducted prior to developing YDS-GlueFold. Notably, the unmodified AlphaFold3-type baseline failed to predict any of the eight complexes, underscoring the difficulty of sampling ternary conformations. By contrast, our FK-steered diffusion approach--FKSFold--successfully predicted 3 of the 8 cases in these early trials. We detail how we leveraged FK formalism to modify the diffusion process, using interface predicted TM-score (ipTM) as a reward function to guide sampling toward high-quality protein-protein interfaces in ternary complexes. This strategy of using ipTM as a reward function aligns well with the mechanism of action (MOA) of molecular glues, which function by inducing or stabilizing protein-protein interfaces. By implementing stochastic control theory within the diffusion module, our approach attempted to steer the reverse diffusion process toward conformations with superior interface quality in ternary protein-protein-small molecule complexes. In these early trials, FK steering successfully predicted 3 out of the 8 cases that were later all correctly predicted by YDS-GlueFold. This work provides insights into the evolution of our technical approaches toward molecular glue-induced complex prediction, documenting an important step in the development pathway that eventually led to YDS-GlueFold. Code is available at https://github.com/YDS-Pharmatech/FKSFold."
"Single-cell multi-omics data have a high potential for deciphering complex cellular mechanisms. But simultaneously measuring multi-omics data from the same cells is still challenging, which calls for computational methods to integrate data of multiple modalities and generate unobserved data. In this paper, we present scDiffusion-X, a latent diffusion model tailored for this task. The model uses autoencoders to map the multi-modalities into low-dimensional latent spaces, coupled with a Dual-Cross-Attention (DCA) module we invented to learn hidden links between modalities. DCA enables the model to unravel interactions among features of multiple modalities and interpretable integration of multi-omics data. We designed a framework with DCA to extract comprehensive relationships between genes and regulatory elements. scDiffusion-X not only excels in generating multi-omics data under various conditions, but also can translate data between modalities with high fidelity, which cannot be achieved with existing multi-omics data simulators. Extensive benchmarking experiments showed that scDiffusion-X has superior performance in scalability, quality of generated data, and model interpretability compared with existing methods. It can serve as a powerful tool for unleashing the potential of single-cell multi-omics data in studying the multifaceted mechanisms in cells."
"Upon engagement of one of the 19 secreted Wnt signalling proteins with one of the 10 Frizzled transmembrane Wnt receptors (FZD1-10), a wide variety of cellular Wnt signalling responses can be elicited, the selectivity of which depends on: 1) the specific Wnt-FZD pairing, 2) the participation of Wnt co-receptors, and 3) the cellular context. Co-receptors play a pivotal role in guiding the specificity of Wnt signaling, most notably between {beta}-catenin dependent and independent pathways, where co-receptors such as LRP5/6 and ROR1/2 / PTK7 play major roles, respectively. It remains less understood how specific Wnt/FZD combinations contribute to the selectivity of downstream Wnt signaling and we lack accurate comparative data on their binding properties under physiological conditions. Here, using fluorescently-tagged Wnt3a, Wnt5a and Wnt16 proteins and cell lines expressing HiBiT-tagged Frizzled, we build on our ongoing efforts to provide a complete overview of the biophysical properties of all Wnt/FZD interactions using full-length proteins. Our real-time NanoBRET analysis using living cells expressing low receptor levels provides more accurate quantification of binding and will help us understand how these binary engagements control Wnt signaling outputs. We also provide evidence that LRP6 regulates the binding affinity of Wnt/FZD interactions in the trimeric Wnt-FZD-LRP6 complex."
"Computational modeling has recently emerged as a powerful tool to better understand seizure dynamics and guide new treatment strategies. This work presents a method for personalizing whole-brain computational models in epilepsy, integrating SEEG, MRI, and diffusion MRI data to enhance therapeutic approaches. The objective of this method is to construct a mechanistic model replicating seizure propagation from the epileptogenic network to the entire brain, which can then be used to simulate and evaluate patient-specific therapeutic interventions. The pipeline uses neural mass models for each node in the network, simulating whole-brain dynamics. Model personalization involves adjusting global and local parameters representing the excitability of individual brain areas, using an evolutionary algorithm that aims to maximize the correlation between empirical and synthetic functional connectivity matrices derived from SEEG data. The resulting personalized models successfully reproduce individual seizure propagation patterns and can be used to simulate therapeutic interventions like surgery, stimulation, or pharmacological interventions within a unified physiological framework. Notably, model predictions reveal distinct patient-specific responses across interventions, highlighting the potential of whole-brain modeling to guide individualized treatment by identifying accessible and functionally relevant targets."
"Biomolecular condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation play key roles in intracellular organization and signaling, yet their function in extracellular environments remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish a model using heparan sulfate, a key component of the extracellular matrix, to study extracellular condensate-cell interactions. We demonstrate that heparan sulfate can form condensates with a positively charged counterpart in serum-containing solutions, mimicking the complexity of extracellular fluid, and supporting cell viability. We observe that these condensates adhere to cell membranes and remain stable, enabling a versatile platform for examining extracellular condensate dynamics and quantifying their rheological properties as well as their adhesion forces with cellular surfaces. Our findings and methodology open new avenues for understanding the organizational roles of condensates beyond cellular boundaries."
"The host retinal microglia and macrophage activation remains a major challenge for the integration of donor neurons following transplantation. Previously, we and others have shown that it is possible to increase donor retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival by inhibiting the microglia-RGC interaction with Annexin V or through reprogramming microglia with the soluble Fas ligand. However, the exact mechanisms of the microglia/macrophage activation and their heterogeneity following transplantation remain unknown. To address this question, the donor RGC were differentiated from Brn3b-Tdtomato-Thy1.2 human embryonic stem cells using a 3D protocol, followed by dissociation and RGC purification. RGC were delivered subretinally (1.5x104 viable cells/eye) into 3-6-month-old CX3CR1GFPknock-in mice. Three days after transplantation retinas were dissociated into single-cell suspension and GFP-positive myeloid cells isolated using FACS. Of the sorted cells, up to 10,000 viable cells per sample were used for single-cell RNA library preparation and sequenced using the 10X Genomics Chromium platform. In addition, several retinas were fixed and stained for donor RGC (mCherry) and host microglia/macrophages (Iba1). RNA Velocity was used to reconstruct the myeloid cell population and activation trajectory from scRNAseq data. We observed continuous bi-directional transition of microglia/macrophages from a homeostatic to an activated state. We also observed that the response to the transplant falls into the classic disease-associated-microglia (DAM) activation paradigm with a decrease in expression of the homeostatic gene Tmem119 and an increase in expression of disease-associated genes including Apoe, Lgals3, and Spp1. Our findings show that the host retinal myeloid cell population undergoes activation upon transplantation of stem-cell derived donor RGC, with a molecular profile of the activated cells similar to that of activated myeloid cells associated with neurodegenerative diseases of the brain and the eye. Advanced integrated transcriptomic analysis shows separate activated-to-homeostatic and homeostatic-to-activated trajectories suggesting the reversibility of this process."
"Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for exploring the brains functional organization. Functional connectivity (FC) is a commonly studied feature of fMRI data defined as the temporal correlation between activity patterns in pairs of brain regions. A major discovery of the past two decades of FC research has been the identification of consistent modular groupings in brain region time series correlations, commonly known as resting-state networks (RSNs). A second major discovery is the observation that RSNs in cortex are organized spatially along a functional/anatomical gradient. At one end of this gradient are  lower order networks (LONs), predominantly specialized for unimodal information processing. At the other end are  higher order networks (HONs), responsible for integrating multimodal information. Unlike the stable structural connectivity (SC) based on fixed anatomical links, FC fluctuates over time, and varies across brain regions. FC coordination within RSNs depends on SC, forming interconnected networks that regulate cognition, emotion, and behavior. The aim of the present study was to understand better how RSNs interact and communicate, based on their underlying SC. We used a whole-brain connectome-based neural mass modelling approach to study resting-state and task-based fMRI FC data. Following virtual SC lesions in the model, we characterized the FC changes within and between RSNs, and observed how these changes varied across different cognitive states. Our findings reveal how FC dynamics depend on underlying SC, highlighting the flexibility of these interactions across different brain states. LON lesions generally decrease FC within and between other LONs, and vice-versa for HON lesions. At rest, we observed a mutual antagonism between LONs and HONs, which was reversed during task conditions, with certain tasks increasing coordination between LONs and HONs. These results highlight the dynamic nature of brain network interactions, influenced by brain states and task demands. Our findings also have implications for clinical practice, offering insights into conditions such as brain tumors and stroke.

"The prefrontal cortex continuously filters irrelevant stimuli, and deficits in this sensory gating predispose to psychotic disorders. In schizophrenia, the normally observed suppression of second response to two paired sounds is drastically reduced. Apart from sensitivity to critical schizophrenia players as NMDA and dopamine, the microcircuitry behind gating remains unknown. We found that the first sound excitatory response recruits, via NMDA receptors, local inhibition to gate the second response via GABAB receptors. Optogenetic inhibition of somatostatine-interneurons counteracted gating more effectively compared to parvalbumine-positive interneurons. Dopamine local blockade also counteracted gating, and dopamine effect was prevented by somatostatine-, but not parvalbumine-, optoactivation. Thus, prefrontal gating is mediated by NMDA-dependent recruitment of dendrite-targeting, somatostatine-interneurons, facilitated by dopamine. The results identify a critical synapse to better target psychose-prone disorders."
"Down syndrome (DS) is caused by triplication of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21), resulting in skeletal insufficiency and altered postnatal bone development in individuals with DS. DS mouse models have shown similar deficits to humans with DS, mimicking differences between ages, sexes, and bone compartments. The historic mouse model, Ts65Dn, has provided much of the mechanistic insight behind these DS-related skeletal deficits, but there are concerns over its genetic construct validity. Ts65Dn mice have an additional 60 trisomic genes that are homologous to Hsa6. These genes, acting either directly or through interactions with trisomic, Hsa21-homologous or disomic genes, may produce phenotypes not related to DS; so, Ts66Yah mice were derived to remove these genes. After assessing individual densitometric and morphometric parameters in femurs, skeletal phenotypes were directly compared between male and female Ts65Dn and Ts66Yah mice at postnatal day (P) 36 and 6-weeks and between male mice at 16-weeks using multivariate principal components analyses on these parameters. These comparisons confirmed male Ts66Yah mice have trabecular and cortical deficits similar to male Ts65Dn mice at all ages. In contrast, female Ts66Yah mice lacked trabecular deficits evident in female Ts65Dn mice at P36, but both ages had similar cortical deficits. Copy number normalization of Dyrk1a, a trisomic, Hsa21-orthologous gene, failed to rescue deficits in male or improve trabecular bone in female Ts66Yah mice at P36 as observed in Ts65Dn mice. Thus, mechanisms behind trabecular phenotypes in both sexes of Ts66Yah mice likely differ from those of Ts65Dn mice. Overall, the trisomic, Hsa6-homologous genes in Ts65Dn mice may result in differences in trabecular phenotypes or mechanisms prior to 6 weeks but do not impact later trabecular or cortical phenotypes."
"AlphaFold-Multimer models protein complexes and facilitates protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction. Mapping of protein interaction domains and motifs onto the 3D structure can lend credence to the model and provide insight into the function of a given interaction. Furthermore, limiting structure prediction to only the domains and motifs that are likely to interact can reduce the computational demand and produce a higher quality model. To satisfy these needs, we built the Protein-Protein Interaction Identifier (PPI-ID). PPI-ID maps interaction domains and motifs onto molecular structures and filters for those that are sufficiently close to interact. Once an interface is found, PPI-ID labels interacting amino acids. Given only sequences, PPI-ID predicts regions for AlphaFold-Multimer modeling, reporting potential interactions only when each protein has one-half of a paired sequence. Testing with known dimers confirms high accuracy of the tool."
"Foundation models, which encode patterns in large, high-dimensional data as embeddings, show promise in many machine learning related applications in molecular biology. Embeddings learned by the models provide informative features for downstream prediction tasks, however, the information captured by the model is often not interpretable. One approach to understanding the captured information is through the analysis of their learned embeddings, which in molecular biology so far has mainly focused on visualizing individual embedding spaces. This study introduces a quantitative framework for cross-space comparison, enabling intuitive exploration and comparison of embedding spaces in molecular biology. The framework emphasizes analyzing the distribution of known biological information within embedding space neighborhoods and provides insights into relationships between multiple embedding spaces. Comparison techniques include global pairwise distance measurements as well as local nearest neighbor analyses. By applying our framework to embeddings from protein language models, we demonstrate how embedding space analysis can serve as a valuable pre-filtering step for task-specific supervised machine learning applications and for the recognition of differential patterns in data encoded within and across different embedding spaces. To support a wide usability, we provide a Python library that implements all analysis methods, available at https://github.com/broadinstitute/EmmaEmb."
"Because no previous simulation-based study assessed the influence of epistasis on the genomic prediction of untested single crosses (SCs), the objective was to assess the impact of epistasis on the genomic prediction of untested SCs in multi-environment trials (METs), assuming seven types of digenic epistasis. We genotyped two groups of 70 doubled-haploid lines and phenotyped all 4900 SCs in five environments. The average density for SNPs was 0.03 cM. Regarding the distribution of the SCs over environments, we adopted 10 and 30% of tested SCs and 80% of non-overlapping SCs. To assess the efficacy of the genomic prediction we computed coincidence index (CI) and prediction accuracy. The percentage of the genotypic variance due to epistasis ranged from 18 to 48%. The CI ranged from 0.24 to 0.38, under the lower training set, and between 0.30 to 0.50, assuming the higher training set. Fixing complementary epistasis and increasing the ratio epistatic variance/genotypic variance from 18 to 39% led to a decrease in the coincidence index in the range from 6.5 to 22.0%. Accuracy showed a positive correlation with CI. Assuming epistasis but fitting the additive-dominance model led to a decrease in the CI. Epistasis can significantly affect the genomic prediction of SCs in METs, depending on type, proportion of the genotypic variance due to epistasis. The prediction accuracy efficiently expresses the efficacy of genomic prediction of untested SCs. The genomic prediction of untested single crosses in each environment and across environments is very effective, even under a low training set size."
"Excessive degradation of the colonic mucin layer by Bacteroides within the human gut microbiota drives inflammatory bowel disease in mice. Bacterial carbohydrate sulfatases are key enzymes in gut colonization, as they are elevated in human inflammatory bowel disease and correlate with disease severity. Selective inhibitors of carbohydrate sulfatases could function as sulfatase-selective drugs, allowing precise control of sulfatase activity while preserving these otherwise beneficial bacteria. Arylsulfamates are covalent inhibitors that target a catalytic formylglycine residue of steroid sulfatases, a residue that is also conserved in carbohydrate sulfatases. Here, we find that a library of aryl- and carbohydrate sulfamates is ineffective against Bacteroides carbohydrate sulfatases, yet can inhibit human gut microbiota species grown on sulfated glycans. Leveraging thermal proteome profiling, we identify a lipid kinase as the target responsible for these effects. This work highlights the imperative for developing specific inhibitors targeting carbohydrate sulfatases and reveals the adverse effects that arylsulfamates have on Bacteroides species of the human gut microbiota.

Significance statementArylsulfamates are currently the only effective class of sulfatase inhibitors available and offer a potential strategy to treat inflammatory bowel disease driven by gut microbiota carbohydrate sulfatases. Although arylsulfamates inhibit the growth of microbiota Bacteroides species on sulfated glycans, this is not mediated through carbohydrate sulfatases but, via a conserved lipid kinase. Carbohydrate sulfatases are resistant to arylsulfamates whilst steroid sulfatases are susceptible despite a conserved active site. Finally, selected complex plant glycans confer a resistant/protective phenotype against the harmful effects of arylsulfamates. These data guide the future development of targeted carbohydrate sulfatase inhibitors and potential drug-prebiotic pairings."
"Understanding the evolution of the bilaterian brain requires a detailed exploration of the precise nature of cellular and subcellular differences between related brains. To define the anatomical substrates of evolutionary change in the nervous system, we undertook an electron micrographic reconstruction of the brain of the predatory nematode Pristionchus pacificus. A comparison with the brain of Caenorhabditis elegans, which diverged at least 100 million years ago, reveals a conserved nematode core connectome and a wide range of specific substrates of evolutionary change. These changes include differences in neuronal cell death, neuronal cell position, axo-dendritic projection patterns and many changes in synaptic connectivity of homologous neurons that display no obvious changes in overall neurite morphology and projection patterns. Arguing against specific hot spots of evolutionary change, connectivity differences are distributed throughout the nervous system and extend to glia as well. We observed examples of apparent circuit drift, where changes in morphology and connectivity of a neuron do not appear to alter its behavioral output. In conclusion, our comprehensive comparison of distantly related nematode species provides novel vistas on patterns of conservation as well as the substrates of evolutionary change in the brain that span multiple organizational levels."
"Human 1,4-galactosyltransferase (A4galt) is a glycosyltransferase existing in humans as two isoforms, widespread A4galt (named A4G) and its rare variant with p.Q211E substitution (A4Gmut). Both isoforms produce Gb3 (Gal1[-&gt;]4Gal{beta}1[-&gt;]4Glc-Cer) on glycosphingolipids and P1 glycotope (Gal1[-&gt;]4Gal{beta}1[-&gt;]4GlcNAc-R) on glycoproteins, which serve as receptors for Shiga toxin types 1 and 2 (Stx1 and Stx2). Stx1 is bound by Gb3 and P1 glycotope, while Stx2 is recognized solely by Gb3. To elucidate the role of these receptors, CHO-Lec2 cells expressing human A4G and A4Gmut were modified by disrupting the hamster B4GALT5 gene using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The B4GALT5 gene encodes {beta}1,4-galactosyltransferase 5 (B4galt5), synthesizing lactosylceramide, the key substrate for Gb3 synthesis. Consequently, B4GALT5-deficient CHO-Lec2-expressing A4G and A4Gmut cells lacked Gb3 glycosphingolipid but retained the ability to synthesize glycoprotein-based P1 glycotope. Both B4GALT5-deficient CHO-Lec2 cells expressing A4G and A4Gmut demonstrated no binding of Stx1B and Stx2B. The cytotoxicity assay showed that B4GALT5-deficient CHO-Lec2 cells expressing A4G were completely resistant to Stx1 holotoxin while A4Gmut-expressing cells revealed reduced sensitivity to Stx2. The glycoengineered CHO-Lec2 cells obtained in this study provide a valuable model for studying receptors for Stxs, enabling a detailed assessment of their roles in toxin binding and cytotoxicity."
"The tumor suppressor p53 plays a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity in response to exogenous or endogenous stresses. The dynamics of p53 activation are stimulus- and cell type- dependent and regulate cell fate. Acting as a transcription factor, p53 induces the expression of target genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. However, transcription is not a deterministic process, but rather occurs in bursts of activity and promoters switch stochastically between ON and OFF states, resulting in substantial cell-to-cell variability. Here, we characterized how stimulus-dependent p53 dynamics are converted into specific gene regulation patterns by inducing diverse forms of DNA damage ranging from ionizing and UV radiation to clinically relevant chemotherapeutics. We employed single molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization (smFISH) to quantify the activity of target gene promoters at the single-cell and single-molecule level. To analyse this comprehensive data set, we developed a new framework for determining parameters of stochastic gene expression by Bayesian inference. Using this combined theoretical and experimental approach, we revealed that features of promoter activity are differentially regulated depending on the target gene and the nature and extent of the DNA damage induced. Indeed, stimulus-specific stochastic gene expression is predominantly regulated by promoter activation and deactivation rates. Interestingly, we found that in many situations, transcriptional activity was uncoupled from the total amount of p53 and the fraction bound to DNA, highlighting that transcriptional regulation by p53 is a multi- dimensional process. Taken together, our study provides insights into p53-mediated transcriptional regulation as an example of a dynamic transcription factor that shapes the cellular response to DNA damage."
"The viscoelastic nature of biological cells has emerged as an increasingly important research subject due to its relevance for cellular functions under physiological and pathological conditions. Advancements in microfluidics have made this technology a promising tool to study the viscoelasticity of cells. However, significant challenges remain, including the complex distribution of stresses acting on cells depending on the channel geometry, and the difficulty of keeping cells in the focal plane for imaging. Here, we report a new approach using hyperbolic channels for measuring cell viscoelasticity. A channel height much larger than the typical cell size minimized shear stresses so that normal stresses in the hyperbolic region dominated the stress distribution. Reducing the complexity of the stress-strain relationship allowed us to use polyacrylamide microgel beads to calibrate the stress curve. Additionally, we introduced 3D hydrodynamic focusing which enabled us to focus cells and microgel beads in the center of the channel. Finally, Kelvin-Voigt and power-law rheology models were employed to extract the mechanical properties of microgel beads and human leukemia HL60 cells. The measurement technique described here will help establish the viscoelastic properties of cells as an important readout in biophysical research in health and disease."
"Crop improvement goals for maize (Zea mays L.) involve the targeted optimization of various organs, making it crucial to understand the developmental characteristics and gene expression patterns during organ development and in response to environmental stresses such as drought. In this study, we investigated the development of maize leaves and internodes at both macroscopic and cellular level, and identified a shared fundamental growth design with distinct timing between the two organs. By transcriptome profiling developmental zones of leaves and internodes of different ranks, and of the ear, at different growth stages under both well-watered and drought conditions, we generated a high-resolution spatiotemporal transcriptome dataset on 272 different tissues and conditions, which we make available as a searchable database. While the gene regulatory networks governing cell division and cell elongation were highly conserved across organs, precise expression regulation of particular gene families was observed across organs and within the same organ. Additionally, we highlight the expression of key genes involved in regulating leaf angle and vascular development, showing spatiotemporal regulation of differentiation parallel to growth. This comprehensive expression atlas, combined with phenotypic data, offers a deeper understanding of the similarities and differences among shoot organs and tissues during development and drought response, and provides a valuable resource for engineering organ-specific traits in maize."
"Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) play essential roles in signaling and regulation but remain under-characterized in the context of human disease. We analyzed nearly one million ClinVar missense variants, focusing on the subset within IDRs defined by curated and predicted annotations. Pathogenic variants were significantly enriched in short linear motifs (SLiMs) and disordered binding regions, consistent with their functional importance. To extend these insights beyond existing annotations, we applied AlphaMissense, a deep learning model for variant effect prediction, revealing localized ""island-like"" pathogenicity patterns within IDRs. Based on these signals, we developed a classifier to prioritize predicted ELM motifs (PEMs), identifying motifs linked to pathogenicity and major disease classes, including neurological, cardiovascular, and cancer-associated genes. Case studies in POLK, FOXP2, and LMOD3 demonstrate how this framework yields mechanistic insight into disease-relevant mutations within disordered protein regions, advancing clinical interpretation in the disordered proteome."
"Young and older adults prioritise speed and accuracy differently during sustained attention tasks. While older adults generally show a preference of accuracy over speed, this is not always the case. The underlying factor behind this inconsistency may be motivational differences, with older participants compensating for a speed disadvantage with increased intrinsic motivation to perform well. We investigated this in a pre-registered study, using the Sustained aAttention to Response Task (SART) in young (n = 25, mean age = 19) and older adults (n = 25, mean age = 69.5). We matched participant accuracy by titrating response window length. Both groups achieved similar performance and strategy during the titration, enabling a comparison without confounds resulting from differences in default age-specific strategies. All participants were then monetarily encouraged to perform better in terms of accuracy. Both groups responded with an adaptive strategy of slowed reaction times and enhanced accuracy, but the young participants improved much more, outperforming older adults, and reversing the speed-accuracy strategies that are typically observed. In addition, older participants reported higher baseline levels of motivation alongside a reduced motivation to alter performance for money. So, while the older participants could match young participant performance in titration due to their higher baseline motivational levels, the young participants improved much more than older adults in response to the monetary incentive. From these findings we argue that older adults are intrinsically motivated to do well on tasks whereas younger age groups perform optimally only after incentivisation."
"Faithful chromosome segregation requires proper function of the mitotic spindle, which is built from, and depends on, the coordinated regulation of many microtubules and the activities of molecular motors and MAPs. In addition, microtubules themselves are assembled from multiple variants, or isotypes of - and {beta}-tubulin, yet whether they mediate the activities of motors and MAPs required for proper spindle function remains poorly understood. Here, we use budding yeast to reveal that -tubulin isotypes regulate opposing outward- and inward-directed forces in the spindle midzone that facilitate optimal spindle elongation and length control. Moreover, we show that the isotypes mediate balanced spindle forces by differentially localizing the antagonistic force generators Cin8 (kinesin-5) and Kar3 (kinesin-14) to interpolar microtubules. Our results reveal new roles for tubulin isotypes in orchestrating motor and MAP activities and provide insights into how forces in the spindle are properly calibrated to ensure proper mitotic spindle morphogenesis."
"BackgroundPedigrees continue to be extremely important in agriculture and conservation genetics with the pedigrees of modern breeding programmes easily comprising millions of records. The structure of such pedigrees is challenging to visualise. Being directed acyclic graphs, pedigrees can be represented as matrices. Common choices are the numerator relationship matrix, A, and the adjacency matrix T. With these matrices, the structure of pedigrees can then, in principle, be visualised via principal component analysis (PCA). However, the naive PCA of matrices for large pedigrees is challenging due to computational and memory constraints.

ResultsWe present the open-access R package randPedPCA for rapid pedigree PCA using sparse matrices and randomised linear algebra. Our rapid pedigree PCA builds on the fact that matrix-vector multiplications with the numerator relationship matrix can be carried out implicitly using the extremely sparse inverse Cholesky factor of the numerator relationship matrix. We demonstrate the utility of randPedPCA using several simulated datasets of pedigrees and SNPs. We then demonstrate the performance of randPedPCA by analysing the pedigree of the UK Labrador Retriever breeding population of almost 1.5 million individuals.

ConclusionsThe structure of pedigrees can be efficiently and rapidly visualised using scatter plots of principal component scores. For large pedigrees, this is considerably faster than rendering plots of a pedigree graph."
"Protein-based drug delivery systems offer advantages such as genetic tunability, structural homogeneity, and high biocompatibility. However, precisely controlling the assembly of protein nanoparticles and establishing correlations between their macroscopic properties and molecular architecture remain significant challenges. Here, inspired by chimeric collagen-like proteins, we rationally designed a series of de novo chimeric proteins comprising an N-terminal globular domain fused to a linear collagen-like domain. These structurally heterogeneous proteins were conjugated with doxorubicin (DOX) and homogenized to form chimeric collagen-like protein-DOX nanocomplexes (CDCNs). By fine-tuning the protein structure and domain organization, we achieved precise control over CDCN architecture and drug release kinetics. Furthermore, to enhance tumor specificity, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)- and glioblastoma (GBM)-targeting peptides were genetically fused to the chimeric proteins, respectively. In both in vitro and in vivo models of TNBC and GBM, CDCNs facilitated selective tumor accumulation, enhanced cellular uptake, and promoted apoptosis while minimizing off-target toxicity. This work establishes a strategy for designing protein-based nanoplatforms with programmable structures and tunable functionalities, offering promising potential for precisely controlling of protein-based delivery system."
"Neuromodulators and peptide hormones play important roles in regulating animal behavior. A well-studied example is ecdysis, which is used by insects to shed their exoskeleton at the end of each molt. Ecdysis is initiated by Ecdysis Triggering Hormone (ETH) and Eclosion Hormone (EH), which interact via positive feedback to coordinate the sequence of behavioral and physiological changes that cause exoskeleton shedding. Whereas the cell types targeted by ETH are well characterized, those targeted by EH have remained largely unknown due to limited characterization of the EH receptor (EHR). A gene encoding an EHR has been described in the oriental fruit fly, B. dorsalis, and in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. However, little is known in these species about its expression pattern and its precise role at ecdysis, and no other insect EHRs are known. Here we analyze CG10738, the Drosophila ortholog of the B. dorsalis gene encoding EHR, and show that expressing it in cells confers sensitivity to EH. In addition, mutations of CG10738 specifically disrupt ecdysis, phenocopying the knockout of the EH gene. Together, these results indicate that CG10738 encodes the Drosophila EHR. As in B. dorsalis, EHR is expressed in the ETH-producing Inka cells; in addition, it is expressed in many known targets of ETH, including the neurons responsible for the secretion of other ecdysis-related peptides, such as CCAP and EH itself. Our results from targeted knockdown and rescue experiments reveal that EHR is required for ecdysis in diverse cell types and that the role of EHR in different targets differs with developmental stage. Our findings indicate extensive convergence of EH and ETH signaling and provide an exemplar of the complex mechanisms by which hormones control animal behavior.

AUTHOR SUMMARYHormones and neuromodulators are important regulators of animal behavior. In insects, one of the best studied behaviors influenced by hormones is ecdysis, which allows the animal to shed the remains of its exoskeleton at the end of each molt. Ecdysis is controlled by two key hormones: Ecdysis Triggering Hormone (ETH) and Eclosion Hormone (EH). Whereas most targets of ETH have been identified, those of EH have remained largely unknown due to the limited characterization of its receptor, EHR. Previous studies identified a gene encoding EHR in the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, and in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, but little is known about its expression pattern or its precise role. Here, we show that CG10738 encodes the Drosophila EHR. We found that EHR is expressed in ETH-producing Inka cells, in neurons that secrete other ecdysis-related peptides, in addition to other neuronal classes and non-neuronal cells. Targeted knockdown and rescue experiments revealed that EHR is essential for ecdysis in various cell types, and that its role can vary depending on the developmental stage. Our findings reveal that the role of EH at ecdysis is complex and provides insights into how hormones and neuromodulators regulate animal behavior."
"Neutrophils have historically been envisioned as a homogenous population of short-lived innate immune cells that migrate to sites of infection, kill pathogens, and die. Recent work, including studies in pneumonia models, has shown that neutrophil transcriptomes reflect the environment from which they were isolated. We used high-parameter spectral flow cytometry to compare and contrast a wide array of surface proteins on neutrophils from different tissues, infections, host age, pathogen virulence, and across multiple time-points of pneumonia. Circulating and airspace neutrophils consistently differed, and surface protein phenotypes unique to each infection setting were identified, revealing tissue-specific and microbe-specific neutrophil plasticity. Phenotypic differences in circulating neutrophils from mice infected with different pathogens (E. coli, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa) identified, even in the absence of bacteremia. Neutrophil activation state was diminished with less virulent pathogens and host age. In the airspace, VISTA, CD200R, and PD-L1 were selectively high on BAL neutrophils (BALN) during S. pneumoniae infection, and we identified pro-degranulation-like (CD88High VISTAHigh PD-L1+ CD101-) neutrophils in S. pneumoniae and pro-phagocytosis-like (CD101+ CD18Low PD-L1-) neutrophils in E. coli infections. Stimulation of VISTA with its ligand VISG-3 enhanced the neutrophil respiratory burst, degranulation, and killing of S. pneumoniae but not E. coli. We conclude that neutrophil cell surface protein expression depends on anatomic location and infection type, resulting in pathogen-specific neutrophil-mediated immune defense in discreet areas of the pneumonic lung.

Graphical AbstractIn brief, Pihl et al. have found that neutrophil cell surface phenotype varies drastically based on tissue, time post-infection, and infection. BALN from early infections have higher activation and maturation statuses, while blood neutrophils are more  migration primed, and late infections have more immune-suppressive and altered pathogen killing statuses. Neutrophil phenotype is skewed towards pro-phagocytosis associated marker expression on BALN from E. coli-infected mice while S. pneumoniae results in a pro-degranulation phenotype. In vitro BMN stimulation of VISTA with VSIG-3 results in degranulation, respiratory burst, and pathogen specific killing of S. pneumoniae but not E. coli.

"Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCXs) transport Ca2+ across the plasma membrane in exchange for Na+ and play a vital role in maintaining cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Our previous structural study of human cardiac NCX1 (HsNCX1) reveals the overall architecture of the eukaryotic exchanger and the formation of the inactivation assembly by the intracellular regulatory domain that underlies the cytosolic Na+-dependent inactivation and Ca2+ activation of NCX1. Here we present the cryo-EM structures of HsNCX1 in complex with a physiological activator phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), or pharmacological inhibitor SEA0400 that enhances the inactivation of the exchanger. We demonstrate that PIP2 binding stimulates NCX1 activity by inducing a conformational change at the interface between the TM and cytosolic domains that destabilizes the inactivation assembly. In contrast, SEA0400 binding in the TM domain of NCX1 stabilizes the exchanger in an inward-facing conformation that facilitates the formation of the inactivation assembly, thereby promoting the Na+-dependent inactivation of NCX1. Thus, this study reveals the structural basis of PIP2 activation and SEA0400 inhibition of NCX1 and provides some mechanistic understandings of cellular regulation and pharmacology of NCX family proteins."
"The rhythmic circadian clock generates temporal variation of critical physiological processes in tissues, making accurate measurement of clock phase or  tissue time a fundamentally important problem. Recent advances in single-sample time inference provides a potentially powerful alternative to traditional time-series based approaches. Single-sample techniques typically leverage population-level RNA rhythms, but the feasibility of single-cell phase detection remains an open question. Combining multiplexed smFISH to simultaneously measure up to 6 mouse fibroblast genes, with a novel inference algorithm using Gaussian Processes, here we demonstrate that even when technical drop-outs are minimized, transcriptional noise in core-clock genes precludes single-cell phase inference. Simulations predict that above 50  clock-like genes would make single-cell phase inference possible. Remarkably however, just 3 core-clock genes are sufficient if RNA levels of [~] 70 cells are averaged. Further, we demonstrate how averaging allows detecting spatially-resolved, heterogeneous clock phases in desynchronized cells. Our work provides a conceptual framework for achieving high-resolution phase detection with a minimal set of core-clock genes, with implications for probing the origins of clock dysfunction, otherwise unresolvable using population-based approaches."
"Maternal effect genes mostly regulate early embryogenesis as their mRNAs or proteins are deposited into the oocytes to function during early embryonic development before the onset of zygotic transcription. Here, we report a case where a maternal effect gene regulates postembryonic neuroblast migration long after the early embryonic stages. We found that the defects of the Q neuroblast migration in C. elegans mannosyltransferase dpy-19 mutants can be rescued by a maternal copy of the gene. Maternal dpy-19 mRNAs are deposited into the oocytes and persist throughout embryonic development into the Q cells to regulate their migration in early larval stages. These mRNAs appeared to be remarkably stable, since long-term developmental arrest, changing the 3UTR sequence, and mutations in genes involved in RNA binding and modification all had weak effects on the maternal rescue of the neuroblast migration defects. Since the defects can also be rescued by a zygotic copy of dpy-19(+), our results suggest that postembryonic neurodevelopment is redundantly regulated by maternal and zygotic copies of the same gene."
"Working memory allows an animal to gather sensory evidence over time, integrate it with evolving internal needs, and make informed decisions about when and how to act. Simple nervous systems enable careful mechanistic dissection of neuronal micro-dynamics underlying putative conserved mechanisms of cognitive function. In this study, we show that the nematode C. elegans makes sensory-guided turns while foraging and can maintain a working memory of sensory activation prior to the execution of a turn. This information is integrated with body posture to localize appetitive stimuli. Using a virtual-reality whole-brain imaging and neural perturbation system, we find that this working memory is implemented by the coupled oscillations of two distributed neural motor command complexes. One complex decouples from motor output after sensory evidence accumulation, exhibits persistent oscillatory dynamics, and initiates turn execution. The second complex serves as a reference timer. We propose that the implementation of working memory via internalization of motor oscillations could represent the evolutionary origin of internal neural processing, i.e. thought, and a foundation of higher cognition."
"Unlike mammals, zebrafish can regrow axons after injury and restore circuit function in the central nervous system (CNS). Mitochondria have been identified as key players in this process, but how different metabolic pathways work together to sustain regeneration remains unclear. Using RNA sequencing of adult zebrafish retinal ganglion cells after optic nerve crush injury, we found that oxidative phosphorylation is downregulated during axonal regrowth. Simultaneously, the thioredoxin antioxidant system was upregulated, likely to limit oxidative damage. Additionally, we observed an integrated upregulation of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway during the initial regrowth phases, possibly to provide energy and supplying NADPH for biosynthesis and antioxidant responses. We show that this metabolic reprogramming is evolutionarily conserved, as a comparable one occurs in the pro-regenerative mammalian Pten and Socs3 co-deletion model. Inhibiting glycolysis and thioredoxin in zebrafish impairs axonal regrowth, suggesting that targeting these pathways could enhance CNS regeneration in mammals."
"Non-crossover gene conversion is a type of meiotic recombination characterized by the non-reciprocal transfer of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. Gene conversions are thought to occur within relatively short tracts of DNA. However, the number of observable gene conversion tracts per study has so far been limited by the use of pedigree or sperm-typing data to detect gene conversion events. In this study, we propose a statistical method to model the length distribution of gene conversion tracts in humans, using nearly one million gene conversion tracts detected from the UK Biobank whole autosome data. To handle the large number of tracts, we designed a computationally efficient inferential framework. Our method further accounts for regional variation in marker density and heterozygosity across the genome, which can influence the observed length of gene conversion tracts. We allow for multiple candidate tract length distributions and select the best fitting distribution using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Applying our method, we estimate that most tracts have a mean of 16.9 bp (95% CI: [16.4, 17.0]), and only a very small proportion of tracts have a much larger mean of 724.7 bp (95% CI: [720.1, 728.7]). We further estimate the proportion of gene conversion tracts with the larger mean to be 0.00525 (95% CI: [0.005, 0.00525]). After stratifying by crossover-hotspot overlap, we infer that tracts whose midpoints lie within crossover hotspots are, on average, longer than the remaining tracts."
"Due to their pivotal roles in tumor progression and therapy resistance, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are considered key therapeutic targets with loss of stromal androgen receptor (AR) a poorly understood hallmark of aggressive prostate cancer (PCa). A paucity of pre-clinical models however has hampered functional studies of CAF heterogeneity. We demonstrate that our newly-generated CAF biobank contains three FAP+-fibroblast subtypes, each with unique molecular and functional traits. Cultures with an early-activated phenotype expressed the highest levels of AR and exhibited AR-dependent growth. Consistently, stromal cells expressing early-activation markers co-expressed nuclear AR in clinical specimens and were enriched in pre-neoplastic lesions/low-grade PCa. Conversely, myofibroblastic CAF (myCAF), which expressed low AR levels in vitro and in vivo and were proliferatively-insensitive to AR signaling modulation, constituted the predominant CAF subpopulation in stromogenic high-grade PCa and castration-resistant LACP9 patient-derived xenografts. Exacerbation of the myCAF state upon castration of LAPC9-bearing hosts underscored these findings. Mechanistically, AR loss in myCAF was driven by an NF{kappa}B-TGF{beta}1-YAP1 axis, whose combined targeting synergistically repressed myofibroblastic hallmarks and impaired autophagic flux, effects that were potentiated by enzalutamide resulting in myCAF cell death. Collectively, these findings provide a mechanistic rationale for adjuvant targeting of the YAP1-TGF{beta} signaling axis to improve patient outcomes."
"Computational theories posit that attention is guided by a combination of spatial maps for individual features that can be dynamically weighted according to task goals. Consistent with this framework, when a stimulus contains several features, attending to one or another feature results in stronger fMRI responses in regions preferring the attended feature. We hypothesized that multivariate activation patterns across feature-responsive cortical regions form spatial  feature dimension maps, which combine to guide attentional priority. We tested this prediction by reconstructing spatial maps from fMRI activation patterns across retinotopic regions of visual cortex while participants performed a feature-selective attention task. Participants viewed a peripheral visual stimulus at a random location which always contained moving colored dots. On each trial, participants were precued to report the predominant direction of motion or color of the stimulus, or to attend fixation. Stimulus representations in reconstructed maps based on a spatial inverted encoding model were selectively enhanced in color-selective regions when color was attended, and in motion-selective regions when motion was attended. While enhancement was localized to the stimulus position in color-selective regions, modulations in motion-selective regions was consistent with a more global enhancement when motion was task relevant. These results suggest feature-selective cortical regions support  neural feature dimension maps: spatial maps of different visual features that are dynamically reweighted based on task demands to guide visual behavior to the most relevant locations based on important features"
"Just as separated digits and repeated sampling enhance somatosensation in humans, mice sense objects through multiple segregated whiskers through successive contacts. Individual whisker identity is maintained through the somatotopic organization of the Whisker[-&gt;]Brainstem[-&gt;]Thalamus[-&gt;]Cortex axis, culminating in distinct cortical domains: barrels and the surrounding septa. By performing simultaneous recordings using in-vivo electrophysiology in wild-type (WT) mice, we identify a progressive divergence in spiking activity between these domains upon repeated behaviorally relevant (10Hz) single- and multi-whisker stimulation. While the spiking activity ratio of multi- to single-whisker stimulation remains stable in barrels, it increases progressively in septa, suggesting inhibitory cell recruitment. Using genetic fate-mapping and tissue clearing, we indeed reveal that SST+ and VIP+ interneurons exhibit distinct laminar and regional distributions in barrel and septa domains. Further, calcium imaging of SST+ and VIP+ interneurons shows that while both neuron types respond to single-whisker stimulus, SST+ interneurons preferentially engage more in 10Hz multi-whisker stimulation, indicating their critical role in progressive stimulus preference. Genetic removal of Elfn1, which regulates the incoming excitatory synaptic dynamics onto SST+ interneurons, leads to the loss of the progressive increase in septal spiking activity upon multi-whisker stimulation, resembling the stable response pattern observed in barrels. The importance of the loss of functional segregation of barrels, versus septa is revealed by cumulative temporal decoding analysis, supporting the notion that SST+ interneuron-mediated inhibition contributes to temporal encoding and stimulus integration. Finally, viral tracing combined with whole brain clearing and imaging reveals that barrel and septa domains project differentially to secondary somatosensory (S2) and motor (M1) cortices. These distinct projection patterns suggest that differential inhibitory processing in barrels and septa may contribute to functionally specialized downstream signaling. Together, our findings indicate that the progressive engagement of SST+ interneurons, mediated by Elfn1-dependent synaptic facilitation, underlies the preferential integration of multi-whisker stimuli in septa. This local inhibitory mechanism likely contributes to the functional segregation of barrel and septa domains and their distinct cortical projections, shaping how sensory information is processed and relayed to higher-order brain regions."
"Intravascular hemolysis releases hemoglobin into the bloodstream, which can damage vascular and renal tissues due to its oxidative nature. Circulating haptoglobin acts as a primary defense by binding to free hemoglobin, forming a haptoglobin-hemoglobin (HpHb) complex that is then recognized and cleared by the CD163 scavenger receptor on macrophages. While the function and structure of HpHb complex are mostly well-defined, the molecular mechanism underlying its interaction with CD163 remains unclear. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of CD163 in its unliganded state and in its complex with HpHb. These structures reveal that CD163 functions as a trimer, forming a composite binding site at its center for one protomer of the dimeric HpHb, resulting in a 3:1 binding stoichiometry. In the unliganded state, CD163 can also form a trimer, but in an autoinhibitory configuration that occludes the ligand binding site. Widespread electrostatic interactions mediated by calcium ions are pivotal in both pre-ligand and ligand-bound receptor assemblies. This calcium-dependent mechanism enables CD163/HpHb complexes to assemble and, once internalized, disassemble into individual components upon reaching the endosome, where low calcium and lower pH conditions prevail. Collectively, this study elucidates the molecular mechanism by which CD163-mediated endocytosis efficiently clears different isoforms of HpHb."
"The biological function of a protein is often determined by its distinct functional units, such as folded domains and intrinsically disordered regions. Identifying and categorizing these protein segments from sequence has been a major focus in computational biology which has enabled the automatic annotation of folded protein domains. Here we show that embeddings from the unsupervised protein language model ProtT5 can be used to identify and categorize protein segments without relying on conserved patterns in primary amino acid sequence. We present Zero-shot Protein Segmentation (ZPS), where we use embeddings from ProtT5 to predict the boundaries of protein segments without training or fine-tuning any parameters. We find that ZPS boundary predictions for the human proteome are more consistent with reviewed annotations from UniProt than established bioinformatics tools and ProtT5 embeddings of ZPS segments can categorize folded domains, sub-domains, and intrinsically disordered regions. To explore ZPS predictions, we introduce a new way to visualize protein embeddings that closely resembles diagrams of distinct functional units in protein biology. Since ZPS and segment embeddings can be used without training or fine-tuning, the approach is not biased towards known annotations and can used to identify and categorize unannotated protein segments. We used the segment embeddings to identify unannotated mitochondrion targeting signals and SYGQ-rich prion-like domains, which are functional regions within intrinsically disordered regions. We expect the protein segment organization revealed here to lead to valuable information about protein function, including about intrinsically disordered regions and other less understood protein regions."
"Biodiversity monitoring is crucial for understanding ecosystem dynamics and species distributions, particularly in the context of anthropogenic impacts and climate change. Cetaceans, as key indicator species of marine ecosystems, face increasing threats from human activities, highlighting the need for effective, non-invasive monitoring methods. In the present study, we developed novel Cetacea-specific primer sets to enhance the detection efficiency of cetacean species through environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding, while minimizing the amplification of non-target vertebrates, such as fish and humans. We retrieved 71 cetacean mitochondrial genomes from a public database and designed 20 candidate primer sets, which were assessed in silico for their specificity and capacity to differentiate cetacean sequences. Four primer sets with the best in silico performance were selected for empirical validation using DNA from tissue samples and eDNA from seawater collected from aquarium pools and Hong Kong coastal waters. All four primer sets effectively amplified cetacean DNA from tissue samples. However, in the aquarium pool tests, three primer sets failed to accurately identify one or more cetacean species due to a lack of interspecific variation within the amplified region. From these, we selected one primer set targeting 268 bp insert length in mitochondrial 12S rRNA region, named {micro}Ceta, and applied it to water samples collected from Hong Kong coastal waters, where the iconic Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) was observed. {micro}Ceta successfully detected S. chinensis eDNA while avoiding amplification of non-target species such as fish or humans. Our results demonstrate that {micro}Ceta is a reliable tool for cetacean eDNA detection, contributing to cetacean conservation and enhancing our understanding of marine biodiversity."
"Models of forest growth and yield are frequently used to inform adaptive management decisions aimed at increasing forest resilience or promoting long-term carbon storage. Despite the increasing ecological detail represented in growth and yield models, there remains large variability (uncertainty) in predictions of forest dynamics under global change. Quantifying this uncertainty and accounting for it when making management decisions is integral to sustainable management in the face of changing conditions. However, the structure and complexity of modern growth and yield models make it challenging to quantify uncertainty and propagate it to predictions of forest dynamics under alternative management strategies. To address this challenge, we develop a Bayesian dynamical model informed by continuous forest inventory data that supports the quantification and propagation of uncertainty in predictions of forest dynamics at a stand scale. The model predicts the temporal evolution of the size-species distribution using a matrix projection process model approximating growth, mortality, and regeneration. Disturbance is integrated through its effect on the size-species distribution within a stand providing a flexible framework to represent adaptive management. We apply the model to long-term inventory data from the Penobscot Experimental Forest in Maine, USA to predict multi-decadal biomass dynamics under five alternative management strategies. Predictions are used to identify the management strategy maximizing live aboveground biomass growth and yield over the model period. We conclude by discussing the benefits and challenges of connecting the model to large-scale inventory data and how its predictions can be used to better inform adaptive management decisions."
"Tardigrades are microscopic animals exhibiting exceptional tolerance to extreme environmental stresses such as desiccation. Hence, they provide unique solutions to biological preservation, anti-aging, and interstellar travel. Recent studies show that various cytoplasmic and secretory abundant heat soluble proteins (CAHSs and SAHSs) enable tardigrades to survive complete dehydration and revive upon rehydration. Using bioinformatic tools, possible molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effect of CAHSs and SAHSs were investigated. The gene and protein sequences of 18 CAHSs and 23 SAHSs from three representative tardigrade species (i.e., Ramazzottius varieornatus, Hypsibius exemplaries, and Paramacrobiotus metropolitanus) were collected from public-accessible databases. Sequence analyses revealed that both CAHSs and SAHSs possess a highly conserved center region bounded by two terminal regions variable in lengths and amino acid compositions. Analysis using AI-based AlphaFold 3.0 showed that the aforementioned terminal regions were disordered in normal physiological conditions. As for the center regions, CAHSs formed a long alpha-helix domain while SAHSs folded into a mixture of alpha-helix and beta-sheets. Furthermore, the trimers and decamers of CAHSs and SAHSs were generated to simulate their structural changes upon dehydration. Intriguingly, CAHS trimers generally formed linear bundles and their decamers were mostly circular, likely providing mechanical support for intracellular structures. In contrast, SAHS trimers or decamers were largely spheric with differently exposed tails, likely filling extracellular spaces or behaving as chaperones. These results suggest different strategies taken by tardigrades to counteract intracellular hyperosmosis and extracellular exsiccation respectively, inspiring new strategies to preserve biomolecules, cells, and tissues in extreme environments."
"Triclosan (TCS) is an anti-microbial agent in a wide range of health care products. It has been found in various human bodily fluids and is a potential reproductive toxicant. However, the effect of TCS on early embryo development in mammalian species is limited. We therefore asked whether exposure to TCS affects mammalian cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs), and if so, whether the effects persist into the early embryo. COCs, isolated from abattoir-derived bovine ovaries were exposed to two environmentally relevant doses of TCS (1 nM and 10 nM) during in vitrao maturation. When exposed to 1 nM TCS during in vitro maturation, progesterone release from bovine oocytes was elevated. Furthermore, altered pyruvate metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction also observed; specifically, O2 consumption coupled to ATP production was significantly decreased in COCs after acute exposure of TCS prior to maturation, whereas proton leak from the respiratory chain was increased. Subsequently, TCS-exposed COCs were fertilised. Fewer oocytes were able to develop to blastocyst when exposed to 1 nM TCS during maturation compared to the Control group (12.22{+/-}% vs 29.11{+/-}% n=5; p=0.02) and those that did reach the blastocyst displayed impaired glycolytic and amino acid metabolic activity. These findings indicate for the first time that oocytes exposed to TCS during the final stages of maturation give rise to embryos with impaired mitochondria function, altered steroidogenesis and disrupted metabolic activity."
"O_LIThe ability of drones to provide detailed information on animals and their surroundings makes them ideal for studying animal behaviour at fine scales. While drones can provide high-resolution images of what animals are doing, they should also, in theory, be able to provide data on where they are. However, reconstructing geo-referenced tracks from drone videos that follow animals is challenging, particularly because current methods require specific drone flight patterns and large computational power.
C_LIO_LIHere, we combine deep learning and object tracking methods with a novel geo-referencing algorithm which allows us to track individuals across video frames and reconstruct their geo-referenced trajectories. We used a Region-based Convoluted Neural Network to detect animals and a Hungarian tracking algorithm to link detections across video frames, and then geo-referenced each detection in every frame to reconstruct individual trajectories.
C_LIO_LIWe tested our geo-refencing algorithm through multiple drone flights with varying flight parameters over known Ground Control Points. The median (95% CI) geo-referencing error was 2.81 (0.74 - 23.23) meters, which reduced by 50% when the drone camera was positioned between -90{degrees} and -40{degrees}. Error increased with drone height and camera angle (-90{degrees} refers to the camera pointing towards the ground) but was not impacted by drone orientation.
C_LIO_LIWe then demonstrate the utility of our framework with empirical examples using consumer-level drones. First, we tracked a volunteer carrying a high-resolution GPS unit and overlayed their GPS tracks on our estimated tracks to quantify tracking error. Next, we used drone videos of two delphinid species (Tursiops truncates gephyreus, and Sousa plumbea) representing varying environmental and flight conditions. We were able to successfully infer individual tracks across all conditions except when individuals formed tight clusters, in which case tracks were assigned a group identifier.
C_LIO_LIOur framework demonstrates an easy and robust approach to translate drone videos of moving animals into geo-referenced animal tracks which is applicable in many research contexts. A major advance over previous methods is that our algorithm is robust to different camera angles, and provides tracks with accuracy on-par with, or even exceeding, the accuracy from GPS tracking.

"The alteration of neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation underlies autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It remains unclear whether targeting convergent downstream targets among mutations from different genes and individuals can rescue this alteration. We identified PBX1 as a convergent target of three autism risk genes: CTNNB1, PTEN, and DVL3, using isogenic iPSC-derived 2D NPCs. Overexpression of the PBX1a isoform effectively rescued increased NPC proliferation in all three isogenic ASD-related variants. Dysregulation of PBX1 in NPCs was further confirmed in publicly available datasets from other models of ASD. These findings spotlight PBX1, known to play important roles during olfactory bulb/adult neurogenesis and in multiple cancers, as an unexpected and key downstream target, influencing NPC proliferation in ASD and neurodevelopmental syndromes."
"Epilepsy is a neurological disease characterized by epileptic seizures, which commonly manifest with pronounced frequency and amplitude changes in the EEG signal. In the case of focal seizures, initially localized pathological activity spreads from a so-called ""onset zone"" to a wider network of brain areas. Chimeras, defined as states of simultaneously occurring coherent and incoherent dynamics in symmetrically coupled networks are increasingly invoked for characterization of seizures. In particular, chimera-like states have been observed during the transition from a normal (asynchronous) to a seizure (synchronous) network state. However, chimeras in epilepsy have only been investigated with respect to the varying phases of oscillators. We propose a novel method to capture the characteristic pronounced changes in the recorded EEG amplitude during seizures by estimating chimera-like states directly from the signals in a frequency- and time-resolved manner. We test the method on a publicly available intracranial EEG dataset of 16 patients with focal epilepsy. We show that the proposed measure, titled Amplitude Entropy, is sensitive to the altered brain dynamics during seizure, demonstrating its significant increases during seizure as compared to before and after seizure. This finding is robust across patients, their seizures, and different frequency bands. In the future, Amplitude Entropy could serve not only as a feature for seizure detection, but also help in characterizing amplitude chimeras in other networked systems with characteristic amplitude dynamics."
"SummaryThe average nucleotide identity (ANI) metric has become the gold standard for prokaryotic species delineation in the genomics era. The most popular ANI algorithms are available as command-line tools and/or web applications, making it inconvenient or impossible to incorporate them into bioinformatic workflows, which utilize the popular Python programming language. Here, we present PyOrthoANI, PyFastANI, and Pyskani, Python libraries for three popular ANI computation methods. ANI values produced by PyOrthoANI, PyFastANI, and Pyskani are virtually identical to those produced by OrthoANI, FastANI, and skani, respectively. All three libraries integrate seamlessly with BioPython, making it easy and convenient to use, compare, and benchmark popular ANI algorithms within Python-based workflows.

"Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) represents a significant clinical challenge amongst central nervous system (CNS) tumors, with a dismal mean survival rate of less than 8 months, a statistic that has remained largely unchanged for decades (National Brain Society, 2022). The specialized intricate anatomical features of the brain, notably the blood-brain barrier (BBB), pose significant challenges to effective therapeutic interventions, limiting the potential reach of modern advancements in immunotherapy to impact these types of tumors. This study introduces an innovative, actively targeted immunotherapeutic nanoconjugate (P12/AP-2/NCs) designed to serve as an immunotherapeutic agent capable of traversing the BBB via LRP-1 receptor-mediated transcytosis. P12/AP-2/NCs exert its immune-modulating effects by inhibiting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis through a small-size PD-L1/ PD-L2 antagonist peptide Aurigene NP-12 (P12). P12/AP-2/NCs are synthesized from completely biodegradable, functionalized high molecular weight {beta}-poly(L-malic acid) (PMLA) polymer, conjugated with P12 and Angiopep-2 (AP2) to yield P12/AP-2/NCs. Evaluating nanoconjugates for BBB permeability and 3-D tumor model efficacy using an in vitro BBB-Transwell spheroid based model demonstrating successful crossing of the BBB and internalization in brain 3D tumor environments. In addition, the nanoconjugate mediated T cells cytotoxicity on 3D tumor region death in a U87 GBM 3-D spheroid model. AP2/P12/NCs is selectively inhibited in PD1/PDL1 interaction on T cells and tumor site, increasing inflammatory cytokine secretion and T cell proliferation. In an in-vivo murine brain environment, rhodamine fluorophore-labeled AP2/P12/NCs displayed significantly increased accumulation in the brain during 2-6 h time intervals post-injection with a prolonged bioavailability over unconjugated peptides. AP2/P12/NCs demonstrated a safety profile at both low and high doses based on major organ histopathology evaluations. Our findings introduce a novel, programmable nanoconjugate platform capable of penetrating the BBB for directed delivery of small peptides and significant immune environment modulation without utilizing antibodies, offering promise for treating challenging brain diseases like glioblastoma multiforme and beyond."
"Nuclear RNA homeostasis depends on the balance of transcription, RNA processing, degradation, and transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm. RNA degradation directed by the Integrator, nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT), and nuclear exosome complexes controls the accumulation of aberrant nuclear RNA. Here, we report that Drosophila oogenesis requires the Integrator, NEXT, and nuclear exosome complexes. Depletion of Integrator, NEXT, or nuclear exosome components in Drosophila female germ cells causes infertility and accumulation of 3' extended snRNAs, promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), and cryptic transcripts. Our data highlight the essential role of nuclear RNA degradation and processing in Drosophila oogenesis and provide a catalog of RNAs whose nuclear levels are regulated by these three complexes. We propose that Integrator, NEXT, and the nuclear exosome support oogenesis by ensuring that inappropriate transcription does not overwhelm the limited supply of proteins that bind, process, and traffic RNA."
"Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is a frequently reported comorbidity of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Early-life inflammatory challenges from the environment (e.g. infection, toxicants) can increase risk for NDDs but the impact of such stressors on the developing GI tract is not well understood. We investigated possible mechanisms by which GI comorbidities occur in response to environmental stressors using our well-characterized model of combined gestational exposure to air pollution (diesel exhaust particles, DEP) and maternal stress (MS), which induces social deficits in male but not female offspring. We show that DEP/MS disrupts normal GI development, leading to altered small intestine morphology in neonatal males, but not females. Recent evidence shows that resident macrophages of the gut prune enteric neurons during a precise postnatal window. We found decreased pruning of gut enteric neurons by the resident macrophages of the muscularis externa in DEP/MS exposed males at postnatal day 14. In line with this, we saw the expression of motor neuron-associated genes spike in males at the same postnatal time point following DEP/MS exposure. Finally, we assessed the motor function of the GI tract of these animals and observed dysmotility in DEP/MS males only. Taken together, these findings establish intestinal macrophages as a mediator of GI development that is sensitive to early-life perturbations from the environment, highlighting a potential mechanism connecting NDDs with comorbid GI dysfunction."
"Circadian clocks orchestrate behavior, physiology, and metabolism in harmony with the Earths 24-h cycle. Low temperatures are known to disrupt circadian clocks in plants and poikilotherms; however, their effects on human circadian rhythms remain poorly understood. Here, we demon-strate that cold exposure abolishes the circadian rhythm in cultured human cells through diminishing the oscillation amplitude, which was restored upon rewarming. In addition, the oscillation amplitude of the 24-h temperature cycles was enhanced through resonance, reflecting the intrinsic frequency of the circadian clock. From a theoretical perspective, these dynamics correspond to Hopf bifurcation, which is confirmed by a mathematical model for the mammalian circadian clock. In contrast, the circadian amplitude of human hair follicle cells was resistant to temperature changes, indicating robust temperature homeostasis. These findings suggest that Hopf bifurcation in the circadian clock for temperature regulation is shared by homeothermic and poik-ilothermic species."
"Withdrawal StatementAfter publication, we discovered that the data presented in the manuscript do not correspond to the microbial strains described in the text. Specifically, the strains were mixed up during the analysis, which compromises the validity of the main conclusions.

We take full responsibility for this oversight and are currently working to resolve the issue. In the interest of scientific accuracy and integrity, we believe that withdrawal is the most appropriate course of action at this time. Therefore, we do not wish this work to be cited as reference fort he project.

"The Clavibacter genus is currently split into ten species, including C. michiganensis, C. nebraskensis, C. capsici, C. sepedonicus, C. tessellarius, C. insidiosus, C. californiensis, C. phaseoli, C. zhangzhiyongii, and the newly described C. lycopersici. These bacterial species have been isolated from different hosts, and some members are reported as non-pathogenic. In this study, we have sequenced and reported high-quality complete genomes of three new Clavibacter strains A6099T, A4868, and A6308 isolated from tomato using Oxford nanopore MinION and Illumina NovaSeq sequencing platforms. In addition, the taxonomy position of other three Clavibacter strains from the NCBI GenBank database LMG 26808, CFBP 7493, and VKM Ac-22542 were assessed and properly defined. Application of different in silico approaches such as calculation of the average nucleotide identity (ANI), digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), alignment coverage (AP), multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) of eight housekeeping genes atpD, dnaA, dnaK, pgi, gyrB, ppk, recA and rpoB, and a phylogenomic analysis of 808 core genes of 97 Clavibacter strains, including the three sequenced novel Clavibacter strains, led us to differentiate two novel clades within the Clavibacter genus that are closely related to C. michiganensis and C. californiensis. The ANI and dDDH values were lower than the 96 and 70% cut-off values for species delineation, respectively; likewise, the phylogenies showed a clear differentiation of these two novel clades with respect to the other Clavibacter species. Therefore, we suggest establishing two new species to correctly classify these two novel clades, for which we propose the species names: Clavibacter seminis sp. nov. formed by the type strain A6099T, LMG 26808 and CFBP 7493, and Clavibacter quasicaliforniensis sp. nov., composed of the type strain A4868T, A6308, and CFBP 7493. The two new species were non-pathogenic on tomato seedlings, their isolation host, which correlated with the absence of the major virulence-associated genes determined in our comparative genomics analyses."
"Learning to read assigns linguistic value to an abstract visual code. Whether regions of the reading network tune to visual properties common to most scripts or code for more abstracted units of language remains debated. Here we investigate this question using visual Braille, a script developed for touch that does not share the typical explicit shape information of other alphabets, yet maps onto the same phonology and lexicon as other more regular scripts. First, we compared univariate responses in visual Braille readers and a naive control group and found that individually localized Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) was selectively activated for visual Braille when compared to scrambled Braille only in expert Braille readers. Multivariate analyses showed that linguistic properties can be decoded from Latin script in both groups and from Braille script in expert readers in an extended network of brain regions including the early visual cortex (V1), the lateral occipital region (LO), the VWFA and the left Posterior Temporal area (l-PosTemp). These results suggest that the tuning of an extended reading network to orthography relies more on the linguistic content of the script rather than their specific visual features (e.g. line junctions). Nevertheless, cross-scripts generalization was significantly lower than within-script decoding and failed to reveal common representations across Latin and Braille in experts in all regions except the l-PosTemp. These results suggest that V1, LO and VWFA encode orthographic representations in a script-specific manner, whereas l-PosTemp encodes abstracted linguistic information."
"The McGill-R-Thy1-APP rat is a transgenic model of Alzheimers Disease (AD) which expresses APP with two mutations found in cases of familial AD, resulting in the development of amyloid pathology and cognitive deficits. Motor deficits are common symptoms of AD, emerging early in the disease, and are correlated with AD neuropathology and cognitive symptoms. This study evaluated heterozygous and homozygous McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats and their wildtype littermates for spontaneous alternation and locomotion in the T and Y mazes, and motor behaviour on an accelerating rotarod. Because rats often jumped off the rotarod, the maximum latency to fall across trials was examined. We found no genotype or sex effects in spontaneous alternation in either maze, nor a significant correlation of spontaneous alternation behaviour between the mazes. Female rats travelled greater distances than male rats in both mazes. While there was no genotype effect in the T maze on distance travelled, in the Y maze the hemizygous rats travelled shorter distances than the wildtype rats, while the homozygous rats travelled greater distances. There was a significant correlation between the distances travelled in each maze. Both heterozygous and homozygous rats performed worse than their wildtype littermates on the rotarod, while heavier rats performed worse than lighter rats, and female rats performed worse than male rats once their differences in weights were accounted for. These findings support the continued use of these rats as a model of AD and highlight the need to consider the possible confounding effect motor impairments have on other behavioural tests."
"Rapid development of immune receptors that protect crops from emerging pathogens is a critical challenge 1,2. While novel immune receptors that recognize previously undetected pathogen effectors could provide protection against a wider range of pathogens, engineering such receptors has been constrained by the low throughput and speed of in planta testing. We established yeast surface display as a high throughput platform to recapitulate plant immune receptor-ligand interactions and evolve new binding capabilities. Using this directed evolution platform, we engineered the ligand binding domain of the rice immune receptor Pik-1 to recognize diverse effectors from the fast-evolving fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Our approach yielded Pik-1 ligand binding domains with affinity for variants of the M. oryzae effector Avr-Pik that previously escaped detection by known rice alleles of Pik-1, with in planta assays confirming functional recognition of these effectors. Additional rounds of mutagenesis and selection led to a Pik-1 domain that binds all tested Avr-Pik variants as well as the evolutionarily divergent effector AvrPiz-t. These results demonstrate the potential of directed evolution to engineer immune receptors with new-to-nature recognition of a wide range of pathogen-derived ligands and accelerate development of broad spectrum resistance in crops."
"Reliable and systematic access to diverse cell types is necessary for understanding the organization, function, and pathophysiology of human neural circuits. Methods for targeting human neural populations are scarce and currently center on identifying transcriptional enhancers and engineering viral capsids. Here we demonstrate the utility of CellREADR, a programmable RNA sensor-effector technology that couples cellular RNA sensing to effector protein translation, for accessing, monitoring, and manipulating specific neuron types in human cortex, ex vivo. We designed CellREADRs to target two subpopulations, CALB2 GABAergic interneurons and FOXP2 glutamatergic projection neurons, then validated targeting specificity using histological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic methods. CellREADR expression of channelrhodopsin and GCamp enabled the manipulation and monitoring of these populations in live cortical microcircuits. By demonstrating specific, reliable, and programmable experimental access to human neuronal subpopulations, our results highlight CellREADRs potential for studying neural circuits and treating brain disorders."
"Living cells adapt to stress by protecting essential resources, such as stabilizing transcripts. Stress granules, which form during stress through the coalescence of polyadenylated transcripts released from polysomes and RNA-binding proteins, are implicated in post-transcriptional regulation, although their precise roles remain contested. To address this, we generated dynamic proteomic landscapes of stress granules during assembly and disassembly under oxidative and hyperosmotic stress using multi-bait BioID profiling combined with quantitative mass spectrometry. Our analysis reveals dynamic rewiring of stress granule proximal interaction networks, identifying RNA-binding proteins involved in translation repression and mRNA decay, including the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, as universal molecular signatures of condensed stress granules. Using the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex as a model, we demonstrate the function of dynamic components associated with stress granules. Complementary genome-wide chemical genetic screening identified CCR4-NOT components as regulators of stress granule formation. Reduced CCR4-NOT activity, which lengthens poly(A) tails, enhanced stress granule assembly, while shortened poly(A) tails inhibited it. Furthermore, stress-induced sequestration of the CCR4-NOT complex to stress granules coincided with known global poly(A) tail lengthening. These findings suggest that stress granule condensation promotes transcriptome stabilization by regulating CCR4-NOT localization as part of an adaptive stress response. This work underscores the power of integrating quantitative proteomics with chemical genetics to advance our understanding of biomolecular condensates in diverse biological processes."
"As climate variability continues to impact agricultural systems, identifying genetic factors that contribute to environmental adaptation will be essential for optimizing breeding strategies for the development of climate resilient varieties. Through human cultivation and naturalization, Cannabis sativa has dispersed globally, adapting to a range of environmental conditions across various climates and latitudes. We combined raw data from multiple public sources to conduct an Environmental Genomic Selection (EGS) analysis on 149 Cannabis sativa samples, to assess how different populations of Cannabis relate to their environmental conditions. Exploring Genomic Estimated Adaptive Values (GEAVs) across bioclimatic variables can facilitate the selection of parental material adapted for a specific condition. We further explore potential mechanisms of local adaptation by characterizing the individual marker effects which underlie these GEAV scores. To facilitate interpretation, we used previously described genetic groupings (Basal, Hemp-type, Drug-type feral, Drug-type). Distinct patterns emerged across population groups with the drug-type (Type I) group showing consistently narrow GEAV ranges, whereas the drug-type feral group showed a broader distribution, often having high GEAVs for precipitation variables. A key climate variable difference was seen in monthly average values, revealing a seasonal response to precipitation in drug-type feral samples. Exploring marker-effect differences between seasonal GEAVs indicated a response to seasonal precipitation in drug-type feral samples. As this samples are sourced from geographic regions that have seasonal monsoons, they may have traits conferring flood tolerance (water logging) that could be introgressed into other backgrounds. The basal group also exhibited broad GEAV ranges across several bioclimatic traits, indicating they may be a valuable genetic resource for introgression to enhance environmental resilience. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating diverse germplasm into breeding programs to improve Cannabis resilience to changing environmental conditions. EGS provides a fast method to enable climate-conscious parental selection while gaining mechanistic information. Ultimately, we hope that such a strategy could support the development of climate-resilient Cannabis varieties tailored to both current and future environmental challenges."
"Anthropogenic threats are reshaping Earth's biodiversity at an unprecedented rate and scale. Conservation policies often prioritise threats like habitat loss and exploitation based on their global prevalence. However, these assessments rarely quantify the impacts of individual or interacting threats, potential masking the true effects of the Anthropocene. Here, we quantitatively analyse the trends of 3,129 vertebrate populations worldwide with documented exposure to specific and multiple threats. Populations impacted solely by habitat loss or exploitation, the most prevalent threats, do not show the fastest declines. Rather, populations exposed to disease, invasive species, pollution, and climate change decline more rapidly. However, habitat loss and exploitation, along with climate change, do act as additive interactive threats, amplifying population declines. Notably, these interactive threats contribute to population declines, more than temporal or spatial sources of variation. Finally, counterfactual scenarios show that to achieve global non-negative vertebrate population trends, we need to mitigate the effects of multiple threats. These findings underscore the urgency of addressing the compounding effects of multiple threats to halt biodiversity loss and suggest that the local-scale impacts of climate change may be more severe than previously recognized."
"The increased intensity, frequency and duration of extreme climatic events (ECEs) in the context of climate change have been recognised as additional pressures for seagrass habitat in lagoon ecosystems. Among these ECE, this study focuses on the impact of marine heatwaves (MHWs) on seagrass species in Mediterranean coastal lagoons, i.e., the seagrasses Cymodocea nodosa, Nanozostera noltei, and Ruppia cirrhosa. We experimentally assessed with a near-natural mesocosm, the effects of a 20-day heatwave at three intensities (+2, +4, +6{degrees}C above control near-natural conditions) in spring and summer on these seagrass species and quantified changes in growth performance, respiration, and gross primary production. Responses to these MHW varied by species and season. C. nodosa responded differently to MHWs in spring and summer, its net foliar growth rate being stimulated and maintained, respectively. N. noltei responded positively to moderate MHWs (+2, +4{degrees}C) in spring but showed vulnerability to the high-intensity MHWs (+6{degrees}C) in summer. R. cirrhosa remained resilient in spring and benefited from MHWs in summer, particularly at +4{degrees}C intensity, to stimulate growth. Hence, all three species were able to tolerate a single 20-day MHW with the species being increasingly better adapted in the following order N. noltei, R. cirrhosa, and C. nodosa. Increase of the initiation and growth of new leaves was a common phenological response observed in all three species, albeit at a lesser extent for R. cirrhosa. Our near-natural experimental approach reveals species- and season-dependent responses to MHWs, highlighting the complexity of seagrass resilience in lagoon ecosystems. These findings provide valuable insights to inform conservation strategies and improve the management of coastal habitats under future climate scenarios."
"This study aims to investigate whether palmatine has a potential effect on sepsis-related pyroptosis in patients through relevant signaling pathways. Initially, the study explores the differential genes associated with pyroptosis in sepsis patients, along with their related enrichment processes, biological behaviors, and functional pathways. Patients with sepsis pyroptosis are then classified into subgroups based on pyroptosis-related genes to analyze the biological differences between these subtypes. Furthermore, the signaling pathways and biological functions associated with palmatine are studied to assess whether there are functional similarities or overlaps with the signaling pathways and biological behaviors observed in patients with sepsis pyroptosis. Finally, the findings are validated through wet-lab experiments. The results reveal that the signaling pathways related to palmatine partially overlap with those observed in sepsis pyroptosis patients, indicating that palmatine may influence sepsis pyroptosis through these pathways. Parmatine may improve the prognosis of sepsis by affecting the immune function of PRKACA, PTGS2, NLRP3, HSP90AA1 and PTPN22."
"Bacteriophages play crucial roles in microbial ecosystems and have potential biotechnological applications. However, our understanding of culturable phages remains limited. This study characterized six novel Escherichia coli phages isolated from pig farm wastewater and urban sewage using comprehensive genomic, morphological, and host-range analyses. Using multiple comparative approaches, including gene-sharing network analysis, average nucleotide identity (ANI), and nucleotide intergenomic similarity (NIS), we demonstrated that five of these phages form a distinct group within the subfamily Stephanstirmvirinae, potentially representing a novel genus provisionally named ""Wecvirus"". These phages were further classified into two distinct species within the proposed genus, each of which exhibits a unique host range pattern. This host specificity is reflected in the species-specific differences in the amino acid sequences of tail fibers, which are crucial for infection. The remaining phage, which was not classified as Wecvirus exhibited characteristics that challenged the current classification criteria, highlighting the need for more flexible taxonomic approaches. Our findings expand the understanding of phage diversity within Stephanstirmvirinae and contribute to the evolving phage taxonomy framework.

ImportanceThe rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens necessitates the development of alternative antimicrobial strategies, with phage therapy showing promising potential. However, the successful implementation of phage-based treatments requires a comprehensive understanding of phage diversity and host-pathogen interactions. Our study expands the known diversity within Stephanstirmvirinae by characterizing novel E. coli phages that constitute a distinct genus. The identification of species-specific host recognition mechanisms within this genus provides insights into phage-host adaptation. These findings contribute to our understanding of phage taxonomy and evolution, while also offering practical implications for the development of phage-based therapeutics against pathogenic E. coli strains. This research highlights the importance of continued exploration of novel phages for both fundamental understanding and therapeutic applications."
"Protein kinases are central to healthy brain function, regulating critical cellular processes through complex signaling networks. However, understanding differences in kinase signaling of brain cells remains a preeminent challenge of neuroscience. This study aimed to characterize kinase pathways enriched in astrocytes and microglia isolated from male and female murine prefrontal cortex. Using the PamGene PamStation(R)12 platform, we discovered cell-type-specific kinomic profiles and computationally reconstructed each cell types unique active signaling protein-protein interaction network. Notably, our analysis revealed minimal overlap between kinase activity and respective cell-subtype specific kinase transcriptional profiles identified in the Allen Mouse Whole Brain Transcriptomic Cell Type Atlas, highlighting an important limitation of relying solely on gene mRNA expression levels for functional inference in kinase focused studies. These findings also suggest that cell- and sex-specific protein kinase signaling may influence susceptibility to deleterious brain conditions and consequently underscore the importance of considering activity as a biological variable in systems research, offering a new framework for developing targeted therapeutic interventions in precision medicine."
"While distributed cortical areas represent working memory contents, their necessity for memory maintenance has been questioned. We examined the differential effects of maintaining multiple items on the neural information across cortical regions. In each trial of the fMRI experiment, participants (n=81) had to memorize two items, each either an orientation or a pure pitch, for 13.8s and continuously recalled the target after the delay. We kept the overall working memory load constant, but varied the sensory modality of each item to vary the effective visual load. We show that increasing visual load decreased behavioural recall performance for orientations and continuous orientation-specific decodable information in visual cortex but less so infrontoparietal areas. Simulations show that this drop in decodable information is best interpreted as a drop in mnemonic information represented by patterns of visual cortex activity. Our results provide evidence for shared labour of visual cortices, where maintaining two versus one orientation leads to a loss in representational fidelity, and anterior cortices, where multiple items could be represented in a more robust but less precise format."
"Trait heterogeneity in a population increases the likelihood that some individuals will survive an unpredictable environmental stress. Individual plants mature at different rates due to genetics, environmental factors, and random chance. All of this contributes to trait heterogeneity. EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3), a core circadian clock component, determines developmental timing, and here we tested the hypothesis that it would shape trait heterogeneity. We developed a model predicting that faster-developing populations exhibit greater heterogeneity during development but reduced heterogeneity at maturity, while slower-growing populations show the opposite pattern. Experiments in Arabidopsis elf3 and barley Hvelf3 mutants supported this prediction. In Arabidopsis, ELF3 controlled hypocotyl elongation variability via maturation rate rather than direct regulation. Bolting time heterogeneity also decreased in faster-growing plants. In barley, Hvelf3 altered growth heterogeneity, but this was initially masked by germination timing differences. Finally, smaller barley plants were found to be more resilient to osmotic stress, suggesting that ELF3-driven trait heterogeneity may contribute to bet hedging. These findings highlight how modifying developmental rates influences population-level trait distributions and stress resilience."
"Mitochondrial bioenergetics are vital for ATP production and are associated with several diseases, including Parkinsons Disease. Here, we simulated a computational model of mitochondrial ATP production to interrogate mitochondrial bioenergetics under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, and provide a data resource that can be used to interpret mitochondrial bioenergetics experiments. We first characterised the impact of several common respiratory chain impairments on experimentally-observable bioenergetic parameters. We then established an analysis pipeline to integrate simulations with experimental data and predict the molecular defects underlying experimental bioenergetic phenotypes. We applied the pipeline to data from Parkinsons Disease models. We verified that the impaired bioenergetic profile previously measured in Parkin knockout neurons can be explained by increased mitochondrial uncoupling. We then generated primary cortical neurons from a Pink1 KO mouse model of Parkinsons, and measured reduced OCR capacity and increased resistance to Complex III inhibition. Here, our pipeline predicted that multiple respiratory chain impairments are required to explain this bioenergetic phenotype. Finally, we provide all simulated data as a user-friendly resource that can be used to interpret mitochondrial bioenergetics experiments, predict underlying molecular defects, and inform experimental design.

"ObjectiveThe fast accumulation of vast pharmacogenomics data of cancer cell lines provide unprecedented opportunities for drug sensitivity prediction (DSP), a crucial prerequisite for the advancement of precision oncology. Recently, Generative Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated performance and generalization prowess across diverse tasks in the field of natural language processing (NLP). However, the structured format of the pharmacogenomics data poses challenge for the utility of LLM in DSP. Therefore, the objective of this study is multi-fold: to adapt prompt engineering for structured pharmacogenomics data toward optimizing LLMs DSP performance, to evaluate LLMs generalization in real-world DSP scenarios, and to compare LLMs DSP performance against that of state-of-the-science baselines.

MethodsWe systematically investigated the capability of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) as a DSP model on four publicly available benchmark pharmacogenomics datasets, which are stratified by five cancer tissue types of cell lines and encompass both oncology and non-oncology drugs. Essentially, the predictive landscape of GPT is assessed for effectiveness on the DSP task via four learning paradigms: zero-shot learning, few-shot learning, fine-tuning and clustering pretrained embeddings. To facilitate GPT in seamlessly processing the structured pharmacogenomics data, domain-specific novel prompt engineering is employed by implementing three prompt templates (i.e., Instruction, Instruction-Prefix, Cloze) and integrating pharmacogenomics-related features into the prompt. We validated GPTs performance in diverse real-world DSP scenarios: cross-tissue generalization, blind tests, and analyses of drug-pathway associations and top sensitive/resistant cell lines. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative evaluation of GPT against multiple Transformer-based pretrained models and existing DSP baselines.

ResultsExtensive experiments on the pharmacogenomics datasets across the five tissue cohorts demonstrate that fine-tuning GPT yields the best DSP performance (28% F1 increase, p-value= 0.0003) followed by clustering pretrained GPT embeddings (26% F1 increase, p-value= 0.0005), outperforming GPT in-context learning (i.e., few-shot). However, GPT in the zero-shot setting had a big F1 gap, resulting in the worst performance. Within the scope of prompt engineering, performance enhancement was achieved by directly instructing GPT about the DSP task and resorting to a concise context format (i.e., instruction-prefix), leading to F1 performance gain of 22% (p-value=0.02); while incorporation of drug-cell line prompt context derived from genomics and/or molecular features further boosted F1 score by 2%. Compared to state-of-the-science DSP baselines, GPT significantly asserted superior mean F1 performance (16% gain, p-value<0.05) on the GDSC dataset. In the crosstissue analysis, GPT showcased comparable generalizability to the within-tissue performances on the GDSC and PRISM datasets, while statistically significant F1 performance improvements on the CCLE (8%, p-value=0.001) and DrugComb (19%, p-value=0.009) datasets. Evaluation on the challenging blind tests suggests GPTs competitiveness on the CCLE and DrugComb datasets compared to random splitting. Furthermore, analyses of the drug-pathway associations and log probabilities provided valuable insights that align with previous DSP findings.

ConclusionThe diverse experiment setups and in-depth analysis underscore the importance of generative LLM, such as GPT, as a viable in silico approach to guide precision oncology.

"Chromosomal rearrangements that generate novel fusion genes are a hallmark of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Depletion experiments in cell line models have suggested that continued expression is required for maintaining their leukemic phenotype and they therefore represent ideal cancer-specific therapeutic targets. However, to which extent this result holds true for the different stages of hematopoietic development in primary cells and whether therapeutic agents can be efficiently delivered to those cells is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that primary AML cells harboring the chromosomal translocation t(8;21) are critically dependent on the corresponding fusion gene, RUNX1::RUNX1T1, to suppress differentiation and maintain stemness. Silencing RUNX1::RUNX1T1 expression using siRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles induces substantial changes in chromatin accessibility, thereby redirecting the leukemia-associated transcriptional network towards a myeloid differentiation program. Single-cell analyses reveal that this transcriptional reprogramming is associated with the depletion of immature stem and progenitor-like cell populations, accompanied by an expansion of granulocytic and eosinophilic/mast cell-like populations with impaired self-renewal capacity. These findings underscore the essential role of RUNX1::RUNX1T1 in sustaining AML and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting fusion gene expression in primary AML cells.

"Therapy-induced senescence (TIS) is a state of cell division arrest induced by chemotherapy that blocks tumor growth. TIS tumor cells affect the tumor microenvironment through their senescence-associated secretory phenotype and independently acquire stemness, which makes them more aggressive and causes relapse once they regrow. To eradicate tumors by chemotherapy, long-lived TIS tumor cells must be efficiently eliminated. Here, we show that AZD5582 and AT406, which are potent antagonists of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP antagonists) that suppress the activities of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (cIAP2), and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), selectively induced apoptosis mediated by caspase 8 and effector caspases in TIS tumor cells, which produced and secreted tumor necrosis factor  (TNF). However, these IAP antagonists were still selectively cytotoxic to TIS tumor cells even when TNF was absent (TNF-knockout cells) or neutralized (by a neutralizing antibody), indicating they have TNF-independent senolytic activity. Consistently, these IAP antagonists also sensitized tumor cells that had been induced to become senescent by nutlin-3a, which activates p53 but does not trigger TNF production. Furthermore, TNF sensitized tumor cells treated with these IAP antagonists irrespective of their senescence status. Collectively, these data indicate that IAP antagonists that inhibit cIAPs and XIAP not only potentiate TNF-triggered apoptosis but also have TNF-independent senolytic activity. We propose that IAP antagonists are good concomitant drugs of chemotherapy that induces TIS, not only as senolytic drugs but also as sensitizers of adjacent non-senescent tumor cells mediated by paracrine TNF."
"Electrical synapses are present widely across the mammalian brain and are crucial components of active neural circuitry and connectomes. Identification of electrically coupled networks in living tissue has been limited by technical demands of multiplexed recordings, and no dyes, fluorescent reporters, or genetic labels are currently able to fill the gap. Here, we introduce a novel method of identifying and measuring electrical synapses: opto-{delta}L combines focal photostimulation of soma-targeted opsins and a novel method for computing the strength of electrical synapses, based on spike timing, to rapidly measure and map electrically coupled networks in vitro. We measured electrical synapses and characterized coupled networks in mature thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and in cortex. We used opto-{delta}L to show that TRN neurons form functional networks that extend as far as 100 m, and that TRN neurons synapse promiscuously, coupling both matching and disparate genetic subtypes of neurons. Future applications of opto-{delta}L will allow identification and characterization of coupled networks across the brain and enable circuit and systems-level interrogations of the identity and roles of electrical synapses in circuitry, behavior, and cognition."
"Recent spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have enabled single- and sub-cellular resolution profiling of gene expression across the whole transcriptome. However, the transition to high-definition ST significantly increased data sparsity and dimensionality, posing computational challenges in identifying cell types, deciphering neighborhood structure, and detecting differential expression - all are crucial steps to study normal and disease ST samples. Here we present STHD, a novel machine learning method for probabilistic cell typing of single spots in whole-transcriptome, high-resolution ST data. Unlike the current binning-aggregation-deconvolution strategy, STHD directly models gene expression at single-spot level to infer cell type identities without cell segmentation or spot aggregation. STHD addresses sparsity by modeling count statistics, incorporating neighbor similarities, and leveraging reference single-cell RNA-seq data. We show in VisiumHD data that STHD accurately predicts cell type identities at single-spot level, which achieves precise segmentation of both global tissue architecture and local multicellular neighborhoods. The high-resolution labels facilitate various downstream analyses, including cell type-stratified bin aggregation, spatial compositional comparisons, and cell type-specific differential expression analyses. Moreover, STHD labels further reveal frontlines of inter-cell type interactions at immune hubs in cancer samples. STHD is scalable and generalizable across diverse samples, tissues, and diseases, facilitating genome-wide analyses in various spatial organization contexts. Overall, computational modeling of individual spots with STHD facilitates discoveries in cellular interactions and molecular mechanisms in whole-genome spatial technologies with high resolution. STHD is available at https://github.com/yi-zhang/STHD."
"Computational advances involving artificial intelligence (AI) and successful experimental state-of-the-art structure determination can provide detailed pictures of large and complex protein structures, and their variations. A standout case is Vitellogenin (Vg) derived from the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Vg is an essential protein for reproduction in almost all egg-laying animals, and can in addition regulate behavior and provide immunological support in some species, including the honey bee. Information is limited in terms of the structure-function relationships that underlie Vgs pleiotropic functions, at least in part because this protein is not expressed in the best developed gene-editing models, such as fruit flies and mice. However, naturally occurring allelic variation in Vg can provide some insight, i.e., into which changes (mutations) are allowable (present at some frequency) vs. likely not allowable (not present or only at low frequency). Here, we leverage a unique dataset of 1,086 fully sequenced Vg alleles from honey bees in 15 countries. We identify a population-specific 9 nucleotide deletion in a locally endangered honey bee subspecies (A. m. mellifera) that impacts a loop structure in a central Vg domain. Due to the A. m. mellifera population history of near extinction and human intervention, an assessment of this Vg variant is not only theoretically interesting but also relevant for subspecies conservation efforts. Using structural bioinformatics, molecular dynamics simulations, and a transformer-based indel predictor (IndeLLM), we demonstrate that Vg protein structure and stability can be maintained despite the deletion. Our approach also reveals the dynamic nature of specific regions in Vg for the first time. Generalizable results may extend to other egg-laying animals of ecological and economic importance."
"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are primary bacterial pathogens isolated from the airways of cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa produces secondary metabolites that negatively impact the fitness of S. aureus, allowing P. aeruginosa to become the most prominent bacterium when the species are co-cultured. Some of these metabolites inhibit S. aureus respiration. SrrAB is a staphylococcal two-component regulatory system (TCRS) that responds to alterations in respiratory status and helps S. aureus transition between fermentative and respiratory metabolisms. We used P. aeruginosa mutant strains and chemical genetics to demonstrate that P. aeruginosa secondary metabolites, HQNO in particular, inhibit S. aureus respiration, resulting in modified SrrAB stimulation. Metabolomic analyses found that the ratio of NAD+ to NADH increased upon prolonged culture with HQNO. Consistent with this, the activity of the Rex transcriptional regulator, which senses and responds to alterations in the NAD+ / NADH ratio, had altered activity upon HQNO treatment. The presence of SrrAB increased fitness when cultured with HQNO and increased survival when challenged with P. aeruginosa. S. aureus strains with a decreased ability to maintain redox homeostasis via fermentation had decreased fitness when challenged with HQNO and decreased survival when challenged with P. aeruginosa. These findings led to a model wherein P. aeruginosa secreted HQNO inhibits S. aureus respiration, stimulating SrrAB, which promotes fitness and survival by increasing carbon flux through fermentative pathways to maintain redox homeostasis.

ImportanceCystic fibrosis (CF) is a hereditary respiratory disease that predisposes patients to bacterial infections, primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa excreted secondary metabolites decrease S. aureus fitness during co-infection, ultimately eliminating it. The genetic mechanisms that S. aureus uses to detect and respond to these metabolites are unknown. The S. aureus SrrAB two-component regulatory system senses flux through respiratory pathways and increases transcription of genes utilized for adaption to low-respiration environments. This study demonstrates that SrrAB responds to the P. aeruginosa-produced respiratory toxin HQNO and responds by increasing fermentation increasing competition. This study describes interactions between these two bacterial pathogens, which could be exploited to decrease pathogen burden in individuals living with cystic fibrosis."
"Single-cell analysis has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, yet current approaches face challenges in efficiency and interpretability. In this study, we present scKAN, a framework that leverages Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for interpretable single-cell analysis through three key innovations: efficient knowledge transfer from large language models through a lightweight distillation strategy; systematic identification of cell-type-specific functional gene sets through KANs learned activation curves; and precise marker gene discovery enabled by KANs importance scores with potential for drug repurposing applications. The model achieves superior performance on cell-type annotation with a 6.63% improvement in macro F1 score compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, scKANs learned activation curves and importance scores provide interpretable insights into cell-type-specific gene patterns, facilitating both gene set identification and marker gene discovery. We demonstrate the practical utility of scKAN through a case study on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where it successfully identified novel therapeutic targets and potential drug candidates, including Doconexent as a promising repurposing candidate. Molecular dynamics simulations further validated the stability of the predicted drug-target complexes. Our approach offers a comprehensive framework for bridging single-cell analysis with drug discovery, accelerating the translation of single-cell insights into therapeutic applications."
"Parental care evolved as a strategy to enhance offspring survival at the cost of reduced fecundity. While most birds provide parental care, obligate brood parasites circumvent this tradeoff by exploiting the parental behavior of other species. This radical life history shift has occurred independently seven times in birds, offering an outstanding opportunity to test for convergent patterns of adaptation in the genome. To investigate genomic adaptations underlying this transition, we analyzed population resequencing data from five brood-parasitic species across three independent origins of brood parasitism -- three parasitic finches (family Viduidae), a honeyguide, and a cowbird -- alongside related non-parasitic (parental) outgroups. Using the McDonald-Kreitman framework, we found evidence for repeated adaptation in genes involved in spermatogenesis and sperm function in multiple parasitic clades, but not in the matched outgroup parental species. This is consistent with evidence for increased male-male competition in parasitic lineages as a result of the loss of parental care. In addition, we detected selective sweeps near genes associated with nervous system development in parasitic lineages, perhaps associated with improved spatial cognition that aids brood parasites in locating, monitoring, and laying eggs in host nests. Finally, we found more selective sweeps in host-specific brood parasites as compared to parental outgroups, perhaps reflecting ongoing host-parasite coevolutionary arms races."
"The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has necessitated the development of alternative therapeutic strategies such as bacteriophage therapy, where viruses infect bacteria, reducing bacterial burden. However, rapid bacterial resistance to phage treatment remains a critical challenge, potentially leading to failure. Phage Steering, which leverages the evolutionary dynamics between phage and bacteria, offers a novel solution by driving bacteria to evolve away from virulence factors or resistance mechanisms. In this study, we examined whether Phage Steering using bacteriophage Luz19 could function in the presence of a competing pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus (USA300), while targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1). Through in vitro co-evolution experiments with and without the competitor, we observed that Luz19 consistently steered P. aeruginosa away from the type IV pilus (T4P), a key virulence factor, without interference from S. aureus. Genomic analyses revealed mutations in T4P-associated genes, including pilR and pilZ, which conferred phage resistance. Our findings suggest that Phage Steering remains effective even in polymicrobial environments, providing a promising avenue for enhancing bacteriophage therapy efficacy in complex infections.

ImportancePhage Steering--using phages that bind essential virulence or resistance-associated structures-- offers a promising solution by selecting for resistance mutations that attenuate pathogenic traits. However, it remains unclear whether this strategy remains effective in polymicrobial contexts, where interspecies interactions may alter selective pressures. Here, we demonstrate that Pseudomonas aeruginosa evolves phage resistance via loss-of-function mutations in type IV pilus (T4P) when challenged with the T4P-binding phage Luz19, and that this evolutionary trajectory is preserved even in the presence of a competing pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. Phage resistance was phenotypically confirmed via twitching motility assays and genotypically via whole genome sequencing. These findings support the robustness of Phage Steering under interspecies competition, underscoring its translational potential for managing complex infections--such as those seen in cystic fibrosis--where microbial diversity is the norm."
"Species occupy diverse, heterogeneous environments, which expose populations to spatially varied selective pressures. Populations in different environments can diverge due to local adaptation. However, neutral evolution can also drive population divergence. Thus, testing for local adaptation requires a neutral baseline for population differentiation. The classical QST -FST comparison was developed for this purpose. Yet, QST -FST frequently fails to account for the complexities of population structure because the theory underlying this comparison assumes that all subpopulations are equally related, resulting in inflated false positive rates in metapopulations that deviate from the island model. To address this limitation we use estimates of between- and within-population relatedness to model population structure. Using those relatedness matrices, we infer the between- and within-population ancestral additive genetic variances under a mixed-effects model. Under neutrality, these inferred variances are expected to be equal. We propose here a test to detect selection based on the comparison of these two estimates of the ancestral variance and we compare its performance with earlier solutions. We find our method is well calibrated across various population structures and has high power to detect adaptive divergence.

Author summaryPopulations of the same species often face different environmental pressures, driving them to adapt locally. However, even in the absence of adaptation, subpopulations can diverge due to random genetic drift and limited migration. Distinguishing between adaptive evolution and random divergence is a central challenge in evolutionary biology. Traditional methods, such as QST -FST comparison, assume equal relatedness among subpopulations--a simplification that rarely holds in complex real-world scenarios, leading to flawed conclusions. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel method that incorporates genetic relatedness among subpopulations, leveraging quantitative genetic theory to estimate ancestral additive genetic variances. Our approach provides a powerful tool for testing local adaptation, reliably distinguishing adaptive divergence from drift across a variety of population structures."
"During perinatal development, liver metabolism is tightly regulated to ensure energy supply for the newborn. Before birth, glycogen is stored in hepatocytes and later metabolized to glucose, meeting the energy demands of the neonate. Shortly after birth, lipogenesis begins, driven by the transcriptional activation of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation. These processes are thought to be largely regulated by systemic insulin and glucagon levels. However, the role of liver-derived local factors in neonatal hepatocyte metabolism remains unexplored. Kupffer cells (KCs), the livers resident macrophages, colonize the fetal liver early in embryogenesis and support liver metabolism in adulthood. Yet, whether KCs influence neonatal hepatocyte metabolism is unknown. Here, using conditional knockout mouse models targeting macrophages, we demonstrate that yolk sac-derived KCs play a critical role in hepatocyte glycogen storage and function by regulating the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle - a role that monocyte-derived KC-like cells cannot substitute. Newborn pups lacking yolk sac-derived KCs mobilize glycogen more rapidly, a process regulated by insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) production. Our findings reveal that macrophages are a major source of Igf1 at birth and that local Igf1 production by KCs is essential for balanced hepatocyte metabolism."
"MotivationMicrobial communities consist of thousands of microorganisms and viruses and have a tight connection with an environment, such as gut microbiota modulation of host body metabolism. However, the direct relationship between the presence of certain microorganism and host state often remains unknown. Toolkits using reference-based approaches are limited to microbes present in databases. Reference-free methods often require enormous resources for metagenomic assembly or results in many poorly interpretable features based on k-mers.

ResultsHere we present MetaFX - an open-source library for feature extraction from whole-genome metagenomic sequencing data and classification of groups of samples. Using a large volume of metagenomic samples deposited in databases, MetaFX compares samples grouped by metadata criteria (e.g. disease, treatment, etc) and constructs genomic features distinct for certain types of communities. Features constructed based on statistical k-mer analysis and de Bruijn graphs partition. Those features are used in machine learning models for classification of novel samples. Extracted features can be visualised on de Bruijn graphs and annotated for providing biological insights. We demonstrate the utility of MetaFX by building classification models for 590 human gut samples with inflammatory bowel disease. Our results outperform the previous research disease prediction accuracy up to 17%, and improves classification results compared to taxonomic analysis by 9 {+/-} 10% on average.

"Stress granules are biomolecular condensates composed of RNA and proteins that form in response to stress; their dysregulation is implicated in neurode-generative diseases. In this study, we develop a minimal stress-granule model, comprised of RNA and six key proteins associated with neurodegenerative conditions, and study its characteristics using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We find that RNA is essential to form stable condensates in these biopolymer mixtures, while underlying protein-protein interactions result in heterogeneous, multiphasic architectures. Inspired by therapeutic applications, we then challenge the stability of these condensates in the presence of twenty distinct small molecules. Simulation-derived properties are used to effectively classify compounds as ""dissolving"" or ""non-dissolving,"" in strong agreement with experimental findings. Further analysis suggests that dissolving compounds disrupt stress granule structure by intercalating with RNA and inducing intra-condensate mixing. These insights advance understanding of stress granule stability and demonstrate modeling strategies for screening of therapeutic candidates."
"Memory and gaze behavior are intricately linked, guiding one another to extract information and create mental representations of our environment for subsequent retrieval. Recent findings from functional neuroimaging and computational modeling suggest that reciprocal interactions between the extended hippocampal system and visuo-oculomotor regions are functionally relevant for building these mental representations during visual exploration. Yet, evidence for the directionality of information flow during encoding within this reciprocal architecture in humans is limited. In the current study, we used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to give a non-invasive account for the directional influences between these systems when new memories are created. Here, we provide novel evidence demonstrating how unrestricted, naturalistic visual exploration induces changes in this connectivity. Subsequent memory retrieval performance was also predicted by the pattern of connectivity modulated by unrestricted visual exploration, identifying the mechanism underlying a rich history of previous work linking increased gaze behavior during encoding to later memory. Together, these findings suggest that gaze behavior shapes the ways in which brain dynamics within and between the hippocampal system and early visual cortex unfold during encoding in humans. Importantly, these directional interactions support the building of coherent, lasting mental representations."
"A/B toxins are a diverse family of protein toxins that enter host cells via endocytosis and induce cell death. In yeast, the A/B toxin K28 is internalised to endosomes of susceptible yeast, before following the retrograde trafficking pathway and ultimately triggering cell cycle arrest. The endolysosomal defence factor Ktd1 protects against K28, but its regulation remains unclear. Cog7, a subunit of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) tethering complex, has been implicated in K28 defence, though the mechanism is unknown. We developed a high throughput K28 sensitivity assay and bespoke analysis package to show that all lobe B COG subunits (Cog5 - 8) are required for K28 resistance. Although the COG complex modulates glycosylation of the surface molecules required to bind extracellular K28, our experiments reveal that the hypersensitivity of cog mutants is primarily explained by defects in Ktd1 trafficking. Ktd1 mis-localisation in cog mutants is reminiscent to disruptions in Snc1, a surface cargo that recycles multiple times via the Golgi. This work suggests not only that the COG complex is responsible for the precise trafficking Ktd1 required to mediate toxin defence, but that Ktd1 may survey endolysosomal compartments for internalised K28. This work underpins the importance of Ktd1 in defence against the A/B toxin K28, and implies various membrane trafficking regulators might influence toxin effects in other eukaryotic systems."
"Infectious diseases continue to be a leading cause of mortality and pose a significant global health threat. Thus the development of tools for surveillance and early detection of emerging pathogens is needed. In this study, we introduce PathogenFinder2, a novel predictor of bacterial pathogenic capacity in humans, available through an online server (http://genepi.food.dtu.dk/pathogenfinder2), or as a standalone program (https://github.com/genomicepidemiology/PathogenFinder2). The model, using protein language models for whole-genome phenotype prediction, surpasses the performance of previous methods, especially for novel bacterial taxa, while being taxonomy-agnostic and alignment-free. At the same time, it predicts the importance of each protein for the pathogenic capacity. This output might aid in characterizing potential pathogens, it readily identifies new candidates for virulence factors and vaccine targets, and offers insights into infection metabolic pathways. Furthermore, we introduce the Bacterial Pathogenic Landscape, revealing distributions related to the host conditions, antagonist bacteria, infection site, or habitat."
"Cryptosporidium is a common, waterborne gastrointestinal parasite that causes diarrheal disease worldwide. Currently there are no effective therapeutics to treat cryptosporidiosis in at-risk populations. Since natural products are a known source of anti-parasitic compounds, we screened a library of extracts and pure natural product compounds isolated from bacteria and fungi collected from subterranean environments for activity against Cryptosporidium parvum. Eight structurally related norditerpene lactones isolated from the fungus Oidiodendron truncatum collected from the Soudan Iron mine in Minnesota showed potent activity and were further tested to identify the most active compounds. The availability of a diverse suite of natural structural analogs with varying activities allowed us to determine some structure activity relationships for both anti-parasitic activity as well as cytotoxicity. The two most potent compounds, oidiolactones A and B, had EC50s against intracellular Cryptosporidium parvum of 530 and 240 nM respectively without cytotoxicity to confluent HCT-8 host cells. Both compounds also inhibited the related parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Oidiolactone A was active against asexual, but not sexual, stages of C. parvum, and killed 80% of the parasites within 8 hours of treatment. This compound reduced C. parvum infection by 70% in IFN gamma -/- mice, with no signs of toxicity. The high potency, low cytotoxicity, and in vivo activity combined with high production, easy isolation from fungi, and synthetic accessibility make oidiolactones A and B attractive scaffolds for the development of new anti-Cryptosporidium therapeutics."
"Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a poorly understood symptom complex that affects 40% of females over the age of 40, with clinical features including urinary urgency and incontinence. In addition to inflammation, oxidative stress, nerve damage and reduced blood flow, alterations in the urinary microbiome (urobiome), specifically in bladder bacterial diversity, have been reported to be associated with OAB. Bladder bacteria are members of the urobiome along with viruses, archaea, fungi, and protozoans. The urobiome metabolism, particularly in relationship to host complex sugars (glycans), has been investigated recently in terms of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) utilization. Nevertheless, other urinary free oligosaccharides (FOS) have not yet been explored in both OAB and urobiome contexts. Similarly, a comprehensive search of microbial genes involved in host glycan metabolism in the bladder of adult females with or without OAB has not yet been reported. In this study, we investigated urinary FOS by mass spectrometry in women without OAB (asymptomatic controls), with OAB without incontinence (dry OAB), or with OAB with incontinence (wet OAB or urgency urinary incontinence, UUI). We also questioned the ability of commensal bladder bacteria to digest these FOS and other glycans, using bioinformatic tools to query publicly available bladder genomes isolated from affected and unaffected adult females to identify genes that encode polysaccharide lyases (PL) and glycoside hydrolases (GH). Our results show that FOS are present in a similar level in affected and unaffected controls with a few exceptions: ten FOS were found to differ between the OAB dry groups and either the control (four) or UUI (six) groups. Our results indicate that bladder microbiota from adult females both with and without OAB have the genetic capacity to digest host glycans and dietary sugars with subtle differences. Bladder bacteria isolated from females with OAB possess more GH/PL genes for host mucins, whereas bladder bacteria from controls possess more GH/PL genes for GAG digestion. In the control group, specifically, the genus Streptococcus possessed genes for the PL8 and GH88 enzymes, known to be involved in host GAG digestion. These novel bioinformatic data can enable future biochemical exploration of the urobiomes metabolism toward specific host glycans, such as GAGs, mucins O-glycans and N-glycans."
"Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder associated with early onset epilepsy, intellectual disability and neuropsychiatric disorders. A hallmark of the disorder is cortical tubers, which are focal malformations of brain development containing dysplastic cells with hyperactive mTORC1 signaling. One barrier to developing therapeutic approaches and understanding the origins of tuber cells is the lack of a model system that recapitulates this pathology. To address this, we established a genetically mosaic cortical organoid system that models a somatic ""second-hit"" mutation, which is thought to drive the formation of tubers in TSC. With this model, we find that loss of TSC2 cell-autonomously promotes the differentiation of astrocytes, which exhibit features of a disease-associated reactive state. TSC2-/- astrocytes have pronounced changes in morphology and upregulation of proteins that are risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, such as clusterin and APOE. Using multiplexed immunofluorescence in primary tubers from TSC patients, we show that tuber cells with hyperactive mTORC1 activity also express reactive astrocyte proteins, and we identify a unique population of cells with expression profiles that match those observed in organoids. Together, this work reveals that reactive astrogliosis is a primary feature of TSC that arises early in cortical development. Dysfunctional glia are therefore poised to be drivers of pathophysiology, nominating a potential therapeutic target for treating TSC and related mTORopathies."
"The adult mammalian heart is characterized by post-mitotic polyploid cardiomyocytes (CMs). Understanding how CMs regulate cell cycle exit and ploidy can help developing new heart regenerative therapies. Here, we uncover that the PIDDosome, a multi-protein complex activating the endopeptidase Caspase-2, helps to implement a CM-specific differentiation program that limits ploidy during postnatal heart development. DNA content analyses show that PIDDosome-loss causes a cell-autonomous increase in nuclear and cellular CM ploidy. Remarkably, increased ploidy does not affect cardiac structure nor function. PIDDosome-imposed ploidy restriction commences at postnatal day 7 (P7), reaching a plateau on P14. PIDDosome activation requires ANKRD26, targeting PIDD1 to mother centrioles. Opposite to prior observations in liver development, the PIDDosome limits CM polyploidization in a p53-independent manner but reliant on p21/Cdkn1a, a notion supported by nuclear RNA sequencing and genetic deletion experiments. Our results provide new insights how proliferation of polyploid CMs is restricted during postnatal heart development."
"Avian influenza H9N2 viruses cause significant economic losses to the poultry industry and pose a public health risk due to their potential to reassort with other avian influenza viruses, generating strains with zoonotic and pandemic potential. Two major H9N2 lineages dominate globally: the G1 lineage (genotype G1-B), prevalent in the Middle East, Africa and the Indian subcontinent, and the BJ/94 lineage (predominantly genotype G57), dominant in China, Vietnam, South Korea, Indonesia, and the Far East. We investigated replication, transmission, and pathogenicity of representatives of these two lineages, linking genotype to phenotype. The G57 strain A/Ck/Vietnam/H7F-14-BN4-315/2014 (Vietnam/315) was more lethal to chicken embryos than the G1-B strain A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL-01/2008 (Pakistan/UDL-01). Vietnam/315 exhibited higher replication in both directly infected and contact chickens, with increased virus shedding from the oropharynx and cloaca. In contrast, Pakistan/UDL-01 virus was primarily shed from the oropharynx, highlighting differences in replication, tissue tropism and transmission. Gene analysis showed the M gene of Vietnam/315 enhanced replication in primary chicken kidney cells, whereas the PB2, HA, NA, and M genes promoted increased replication in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells. Both viruses showed preferential binding to avian-like receptors over human-like receptors. However, Vietnam/315, however, exhibited higher neuraminidase activity and a more acid-stable HA (pH fusion 5.2) than Pakistan/UDL-01 virus. These findings suggest G57 genotype viruses possess greater replication and transmission fitness than G1-B viruses in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro. Reassortment events involving G1-B strains acquiring G57 genes may enhance replication and virulence, potentially increasing the risk of animal and human infection.

ImportanceH9N2 avian influenza viruses are widespread in poultry, resulting in significant economic losses and occasional human infections. Different genetic variants dominate in various regions, but their ability to cause disease and spread in poultry remains unclear. These viruses can exchange genes with other avian influenza strains, altering their infectivity and transmission. This study compared two major H9N2 genotypes: G1-B (common in the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East) and G57 (dominant in China and Vietnam). The G57 virus showed higher replication in laboratory tests and infected chickens, shedding more virus through the orofecal route. It also exhibited a stronger attachment to bird cells and had a more acid-stable HA, suggesting an increased potential for infection and spread.

Our findings indicate that G57 genotype viruses are more infectious and adaptable in poultry than G1 viruses. Gene exchange with other avian influenza strains may generate more virulent viruses with increased transmission potential. This study supports the risk assessment of emerging strains and enhances disease mitigation strategies."
"The pulvinar, the largest nucleus in the human thalamus, is a complex, highly interconnected structure. Through a dense, organized network of cortical and subcortical areas, it provides adequate cooperation between neural systems, which is crucial for multiple high-order functions such as perception, visuospatial attention, and emotional processing. Such a central role is made possible by a precise internal topographical organization, which is mirrored by anatomical connections as well as by the expression of neurochemical markers. While being traditionally subdivided into sub-nuclei, each characterized by distinct connectional and morphological features, recent studies in both primate and human brains have highlighted that this topographical organization only marginally aligns with the conventional histological subdivision. Instead, it has been delineated in the context of continuous gradients of cortical connections along the dorsoventral and mediolateral axes. While this multi-gradient organization has been extensively documented in primate models, it remains relatively underexplored in the human brain. The present work combines high-quality, multi-modal structural and functional imaging data with a recently published whole-brain, large-scale, positron emission tomography (PET) atlas detailing 19 neurotransmitters and receptors distributed across the human brain. By applying diffusion embedding analysis to tractography, functional connectivity, and receptor coexpression data, we identify and characterize multiple topographically organized gradients of structural connections, functional coactivation, and molecular binding patterns. We demonstrate that such gradients converge on a shared representation along the dorsoventral and mediolateral axes of the human pulvinar. This representation aligns with transitions in both structural and functional connectivity, spanning from lower-level to higher-order cortical regions. Moreover, it is paralleled by gradual changes in the expression of molecular markers associated with key neuromodulator systems, including serotoninergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and opioid systems. Our findings represent a significant step forward in understanding pulvinar anatomy and function, offering an exploratory framework to investigate the role of this structure in both health and disease."
"The success of phagosome degradation relies on the ability of phagocytes to regulate the maturation of phagosomes. However, its underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the proton-activated chloride (PAC) channel as a key negative regulator of phagosome maturation. PAC deletion enhanced phagosomal acidification and protease activities, leading to augmented bacterial killing in large peritoneal macrophages (LPMs) upon Escherichia coli infection in mice. Surprisingly, phagosome degradation also stimulated STING-IRF3-interferon responses and inflammasome activation in LPMs, both of which are enhanced upon PAC deletion. The increased inflammasome activation induced the release of cleaved gasdermin D, which localized to the surface of bacteria in the peritoneum and further contributed to their killing. Finally, enhanced bacterial clearance by PAC-deficient LPMs reduced proinflammatory immune cell infiltration and peritoneal inflammation, resulting in improved survival in mice. Our study thus provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of phagosome maturation and the dynamics of host defense response following phagosome-mediated bacterial degradation in peritoneal macrophages.

SummaryThe PAC channel mediates phagosome maturation during bacterial infection in macrophages. PAC deletion promotes phagosome-mediated STING-interferon signaling and inflammasome-mediated gasdermin D secretion during bacterial infection in peritoneal macrophages."
"The appearance of modular protein interaction domains represents a crucial step in the evolution of multicellularity. For example, the class II aldolase domain (ALDODOM) found within the Adducin gene family shares sequence and structural homology to a glycolytic aldolase enzyme found in many evolutionarily ancient phyla. ALDODOM is best known for direct binding to actin filaments through a tetrameric assembly. Molecular details for additional ALDODOM interactions have not been resolved, nor have the sequence changes underlying the dramatic functional switch in the aldolase protein fold. Here we explore the molecular basis for the interaction between ALDODOM of Hts (Drosophila Adducin) and the mitotic spindle regulator, Mud. Our results suggest a distinct mode of interaction, as conserved actin-contacting residues on the tetramer surface were found dispensable for Mud binding. Instead, we identify a critical role for the ALDODOM C-terminal helix (CThelix), along with residues from the adjacent protomer that occur at a tetrameric interface conserved among domains and a subgroup of aldolase enzymes (ALDOENZs). Truncation of the CThelix from bacterial ALDOENZ, or chimeric fusion with that from Hts, confers ALDODOM-like Mud binding. Sequence database analyses suggest ALDODOM function may have arisen in the primitive metazoan phylum, Placozoa, which contain both an aldolase enzyme and domain capable of Mud binding. Finally, we identify a single, conserved arginine-to-glycine change that also permits Mud binding within the bacterial ALDOENZ. Our work provides molecular and evolutionary insights into the function of a conserved protein-binding domain within multicellular organisms."
"Phage therapy, the use of viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophages), is a promising complement to antibiotics during the antimicrobial resistance crisis, but treatment success is very variable. Evolution of bacterial resistance to phage and phage counter-resistance (coevolution) during therapy may explain some of this variation, the dynamics of which may be affected by interactions with the patients immune system. Here, we examine how a pathogenic bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa coevolves with two clinically relevant bacteriophages (14-1 and PNM) when in the presence of macrophages (RAW 264.7 cell line). We show macrophages reduced the rate by which bacteria were killed by bacteriophages, likely by reducing bacteria-phage contact rates. Over evolutionary time-scales, macrophages increased the proportion of phage resistant bacteria compared to where macrophages were absent. These differences in resistance rates were likely driven by the early advantage in density offered by macrophages to bacteria, exclusion of PNM from the phage cocktail which otherwise increased in frequency in the absence of macrophages. Consequently, macrophages significantly altered the short- and long-term efficacy of a phage cocktail. In line with a growing body of work, our results suggest that the immune system can reduce the efficacy of phage therapy, potentially driving variable outcomes in therapy success in patients."
"Papaver somniferum (poppy) is a traditional component of Central and Eastern European cuisine and an important oilseed crop in the region. The crucial thread for poppy stable yield is pathogen infection. Thus, we need to understand poppy defence mechanisms in detail. The first robust layer of plant immunity, which plays a crucial role in combat against pathogens, is pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Here, we provide the first insights into PTI in poppy. We selected four poppy varieties used in the food industry. We investigated poppy response to various peptide elicitors acting as microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Flg22 induced the most robust reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst among all tested peptides. Flg22 also triggered putative mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and seedling growth inhibition in all tested cultivars. We identified PsWRKY22 and PsPR2 as candidate marker genes suitable for monitoring poppy PTI responses. The tested poppy cultivars have low levels of salicylic acid. Callose accumulation was triggered by wounding but not by flg22. For studying PTI in poppy, wounding is a challenge that needs to be considered as it can obscure potential PTI responses. Our findings highlight conserved aspects of poppy immunity and challenges in studying poppy PTI. The established pipeline facilitates improving our understanding of poppy immunity and has the potential for widespread application in poppy breeding and improving selection for broad-spectrum disease resistance provided by enhanced PTI.

The establishment of the methods for studying pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in Papaver somniferum L. (poppy) was inspired by the knowledge of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The study showed a similarity between Arabidopsis and poppy in response to flg22 but also pointed out the obstacles for PTI analysis in poppy and the differences compared to the model plant.

"Fast and accurate object recognition is crucial for effective behaviour in dynamic visual environments. In some cases, the visual system must overcome ambiguity in visual input during object recognition, such as when an object is partially hidden behind another. Recurrent processing between higher- and lower-order areas is thought to play a role in resolving such ambiguity, enabling the filling in of missing visual information. Here we examined this claim using a novel paradigm in which partial object images appear  occluded by an illusory Kanizsa figure, perception of which also depends on recurrent processing by the grouping of Pacmen inducers. If both recognising the partial object and perceiving the illusory shape depend on recurrent processing, object recognition should vary as a function of the presence of illusory shape. Across two behavioural experiments and a separate EEG decoding study, we found no evidence for an interaction between illusion perception and object recognition, and different neural time courses for the illusory figures alone compared to those of the partial objects, which were decoded earlier. Ultimately, our study highlights the robustness of the visual system to solve the identity of the ambiguous object, independently from the processing of different ambiguities occurring at the same time, providing new insights into the mechanisms of recurrence in the early and late stages of information processing and its application to ambiguous object recognition."
"Spatial transcriptomics has enabled the study of mRNA distributions within cells, a key aspect of cellular function. However, there is a dearth of tools that can identify and interpret functionally relevant spatial patterns of subcellular transcript distribution. To address this, we present CellSP, a computational framework for identifying, visualizing, and characterizing consistent subcellular spatial patterns of mRNA. CellSP introduces the concept of ""gene-cell modules"", which are gene sets with coordinated subcellular transcript distributions in many cells. It provides intuitive visualizations of the captured patterns and offers functional insights into each discovered module. We demonstrate that CellSP reliably identifies functionally significant modules across diverse tissues and technologies. We use the tool to discover subcellular spatial phenomena related to myelination, axonogenesis and synapse formation in the mouse brain. We find immune response-related modules that change between kidney cancer and healthy samples, and myelination-related modules specific to mouse models of Alzheimers Disease."
"The diversification of life is driven by the acquisition of new phenotypic traits, known as evolutionary novelties. While some genetic mechanisms underlying such traits have been identified, the role of physical properties of cellular and extracellular components remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that the evolution and development of the bulbus arteriosus (BA)-a teleost-specific, smooth muscle-rich heart outflow tract-is regulated by the mechanical properties of its extracellular environment. Specifically, we demonstrate that the teleost-specific extracellular matrix gene elastin b confers the uniquely low stiffness of the BA. In contrast to the BA, the homologous organ in non-teleost actinopterygians, the conus arteriosus (CA), and the ventricle are predominantly composed of cardiomyocytes, and exhibit higher extracellular stiffness. Loss of elastin b function by knockdown or knockout leads to ectopic cardiomyocyte formation in the BA, accompanied by increased extracellular stiffness comparable to that of the ventricle. Furthermore, artificial stiffening of the BA extracellular environment is sufficient to induce ectopic cardiomyocyte differentiation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that extracellular stiffness governs cell fate determination and highlight its role in the emergence of evolutionary novelties in the teleost heart.

Significant StatementThe acquisition of new phenotypic traits is a key driver for a diversification of life. While genetic underpinnings of such traits have been well studied, the contribution of physical properties remains elusive. Here, we show that extracellular stiffness plays a key role in the evolution and development of the bulbus arteriosus (BA), a smooth muscle-based cardiac outflow tract unique to teleost hearts. We demonstrate that elastin b, a teleost-specific gene, confers characteristically low stiffness to the BA, which is required for proper cell fate determination. Notably, such low stiffness is absent in non-teleost fishes and in teleosts with impaired elastin b function, and artificial stiffening alters cell fate. Our findings highlight the importance of physical properties in driving evolutionary novelties."
"The assessment of oligomer targets in the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction Round 16 (CASP16) suggests that complex structure prediction remains an unsolved challenge. More than 30% of targets, particularly antibody-antigen targets, were highly challenging, with each group correctly predicting structures for only about a quarter of such targets. Most CASP16 groups relied on AlphaFold-Multimer (AFM) or AlphaFold3 (AF3) as their core modeling engines. By optimizing input MSAs, refining modeling constructs (using partial rather than full sequences), and employing massive model sampling and selection, top-performing groups were able to significantly outperform the default AFM/AF3 predictions. CASP16 also introduced two additional challenges: Phase 0, which required predictions without stoichiometry information, and Phase 2, which provided participants with thousands of models generated by MassiveFold (MF) to enable large-scale sampling for resource-limited groups. Across all phases, the MULTICOM series and Kiharalab emerged as top performers based on the quality of their best models per target. However, these groups did not have a strong advantage in model ranking, and thus their lead over other teams, such as Yang-Multimer and kozakovvajda, was less pronounced when evaluating only the first submitted models. Compared to CASP15, CASP16 showed moderate overall improvement, likely driven by the release of AF3 and the extensive model sampling employed by top groups. Several notable trends highlight key frontiers for future development. First, the kozakovvajda group significantly outperformed others on antibody-antigen targets, achieving over a 60% success rate without relying on AFM or AF3 as their primary modeling framework, suggesting that alternative approaches may offer promising solutions for these difficult targets. Second, model ranking and selection continue to be major bottlenecks. The PEZYFoldings group demonstrated a notable advantage in selecting their best models as first models, suggesting that their pipeline for model ranking may offer important insights for the field. Finally, the Phase 0 experiment indicated reasonable success in stoichiometry prediction; however, stoichiometry prediction remains challenging for high-order assemblies and targets that differ from available homologous templates. Overall, CASP16 demonstrated steady progress in multimer prediction while emphasizing the urgent need for more effective model ranking strategies, improved stoichiometry prediction, and the development of new modeling methods that extend beyond the current AF-based paradigm."
"The heritability of human lifespan is a fundamental question in biology. Current estimates of heritability are low - twin studies show that about 20-25% of the variation in lifespan is explained by genetics, and some large family pedigree studies suggest it is as low as 7%. However, these studies do not distinguish between deaths driven by intrinsic biological processes and deaths caused by extrinsic factors such as accidents or infections. Here we use mathematical modeling and analyses of twin cohorts raised together and apart to show that extrinsic mortality skews heritability estimates by driving down measured lifespan correlations among twin pairs. We also identify a nonlinear effect of the cutoff age--the minimum age of death included in each study -- on estimates of heritability. Correcting for these factors more than doubles previous estimates, revealing that intrinsic heritability of human lifespan is above 50%. Such high heritability is similar to most other complex human traits. We thus challenge the consensus that genetics has only a minor effect on lifespan and show that genes explain the majority of lifespan variation. Since genes are important, understanding the genetics of longevity can reveal aging mechanisms and inform medicine and public health."
"Single-cell RNA sequencing has advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity. Ensuring the replicability of identified cell clusters across studies is essential for determining their biological robustness. We assess the replicability of cell clusters identified in two large mouse brain atlases, one generated using single-cell RNA sequencing and the other with single nuclei. Both profile over 4 million cells and group them into over 5000 clusters. Using transcriptome-wide neighbor voting, we identify 2009 reciprocally matched cluster pairs with consistent spatial localization and coordinated gene expression, which were also observed in datasets from multiple species. Reciprocal clusters are enriched in the cerebellum, where lower diversity aids replicability, while the hypothalamuss heterogeneity limits agreement. Distinguishing close clusters is much more challenging than differentiating a cluster from most others, especially when using marker genes. By incorporating replicability data, we provide a stronger foundation for investigating the newly identified clusters and their biological meaning."
"Sarcopenia, or age-related muscle dysfunction, contributes to morbidity and mortality. Besides decreases in muscle force, sarcopenia is associated with atrophy and fast-to-slow fiber type switching, which is typically secondary to denervation in humans and rodents. However, very little is known about cellular changes preceding these important (mal)adaptations. To this matter, mitochondria and the sarcoplasmic reticulum are critical for tension generation in myofibers. They physically interact at the boundaries of sarcomeres forming subcellular hubs called mitochondria-endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum contacts (MERCs). Yet, whether changes at MERCs ultrastructure and proteome occur early in aging is unknown. Here, studying young adult and older mice we reveal that aging slows muscle relaxation leading to longer excitation-contraction-relaxation (ECR) cycles before maximal force decreases and fast-to-slow fiber switching takes place. We reveal that muscle MERC ultrastructure and mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) protein composition are also affected early in aging and are closely associated with rate of muscle relaxation. Additionally, we demonstrate that regular exercise preserves muscle relaxation rate and MERC ultrastructure in early aging. Finally, we profile a set of muscle MAM proteins involved in energy metabolism, protein quality control, Ca2+ homeostasis, cytoskeleton integrity and redox balance that are inversely regulated early in aging and by exercise. These may represent new targets to preserve muscle function in aging individuals."
"Here, we develop a general design for high-quality fluorogenic activity probes to quantify biological processes in live cells, by creating a scaffold that efficiently generates cell-retained bright fluorescent soluble products upon reaction with biochemical targets. Live cell probes must be designed to be membrane-permeable; but that often means that their fluorophore products are similarly permeable, resulting in rapid signal loss from the activating cell: which limits their cell-by-cell resolution as well as their sensitivity for quantifying low-turnover processes. Current strategies to retain fluorescent products within cells usually disrupt native biology: e.g. by non-specific alkylation or solid precipitation. Here, scanning charge- and polarity-based approaches to trigger cell retention, we developed a bright fluorogenic rhodol scaffold Trappable Green (TraG) that balances all key requirements for signal integration (rapid probe entry, but effective product retention, across a variety of cell lines) and is easily adaptable to quantify many target types (shown here with probes for GSH, TrxR, and H2O2). The simple and rugged TraG scaffold can now permit straightforward elaboration to a range of cell-retained enzyme activity probes, that enable more accurate cell-resolved imaging as well as higher-sensitivity integration of low-turnover processes, without the drawbacks of alkylation or precipitation-based strategies.

"Several cognitive maps have been identified, but what sensory signals drive them and how these are combined are not well understood. One such map, the head-direction representation, is believed to be primarily driven by vestibular motion signals in mammals. Here, we combine in vivo imaging of neuronal activity, genetic perturbation of neuronal circuits, behavioral testing, and theoretical modeling to show that the representation of head direction in mouse is driven by not only vestibular but also visual motion signals: both are essential, and the latter, originating in direction-selective retinal ganglion cell activity, dominates at low speeds. We show that, correspondingly, visual perturbations alter navigational behavior that relies on head-direction computation. Finally, we find that head-direction representation and the slow phase of reflexive eye movement are tightly correlated, and we propose a theoretical model that elucidates their emergence from coupled visual and vestibular processes. Our results suggest that the brains estimate of head direction is built on an oculomotor reflex pathway driven by both visual and vestibular signals."
"Understanding the mechanisms that drive chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell function and persistence in multiple myeloma (MM) remains a critical challenge for improving therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we applied single-cell multiomics and gene regulatory network (GRN) analysis to characterize the transcriptional dynamics and clonal evolution of BCMA-targeted CAR T cells in longitudinally collected bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples from MM patients. Our results revealed that CAR T cells infiltrating BM exhibited a more activated and exhausted phenotype compared to their PB counterparts, with key transcriptional regulators driving these changes. Dysregulation in the effector-to-memory transition led to an increased presence of terminally differentiated CAR T cells, correlating with poor persistence. Additionally, we identified a hyperexpanded CAR T clone in the BM of a patient with partial response, marked by elevated IL10 expression. Functional analyses demonstrated that stimulation of endogenous TCR enhanced IL10 production, potentially contributing to impaired CAR T cell proliferation and persistence. These findings uncover critical regulatory mechanisms influencing CAR T cell dynamics, offering new insights into improving CAR T cell persistence and therapeutic efficacy in MM and highlights potential molecular targets for optimizing CAR T cell therapy in patients with MM."
"Flagellar motility is crucial for the swim-and-stick lifestyle of Rhodobacterales and plays an important role for bacterial-algal interactions. This alphaproteobacterial order contains three distinct types of flagellar gene clusters (FGCs) for the formation of a functional flagellum. Our phylogenetically broad taxon sampling of more than 300 genomes revealed that the most common FGC, the fla1-type, was probably already present in the common ancestor of Rhodobacterales and was strictly vertically inherited, while the other two FGC types, fla2 and fla3, were spread via horizontal operon transfers.

Swimming of the marine model organism Phaeobacter inhibens DSM 17395 (Roseobacteraceae) is mediated by the archetypal fla1-type flagellum. Screening of 13,000 transposon mutants of P. inhibens on soft agar plates revealed that 40 genes, including four genes encoding conserved but not yet characterized proteins (CP1-4) within the FGC, are essential for motility. Exoproteome analyses indicated that CP1-4 are required at different stages of flagellar assembly. Only eight genes outside the FGC were identified as essential for swimming motility, including all three genes of the CtrA phosphorelay. Using comparative transcriptomics of {Delta}cckA, {Delta}chpT and {Delta}ctrA mutants of the distantly related model organisms P. inhibens and Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL 12, we identified genes for the flagellum and cyclic di-GMP turnover as core targets of the CtrA phosphorelay and a conserved connection with quorum sensing across members of the Rhodobacterales.

ImportanceThe bacterial flagellum is a sophisticated nanomachine for swimming motility and rapid chemotactic response to gradients of attractants or repellents in the environment. It is structurally highly conserved and has been intensively studied in gammaproteobacterial standard bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. However, the flagellar gene clusters of different alphaproteobacterial orders have distinct structures and compositions, as demonstrated by the three flagellar systems of Rhodobacterales investigated in the current study. The archetypal fla1-type flagellum originated in its common ancestor and evolved synchronously with the host. The universal presence of four as yet uncharacterized essential genes in fla1-type FGCs (CP1-4) reflects the order-specific adaptation of the flagellar system during bacterial evolution. Comparative transcriptome analyses of {Delta}cckA, {Delta}chpT and {Delta}ctrA mutants showed that the core function of the CtrA phosphorelay in Rhodobacterales is the expression of flagellar genes."
"Membrane-bound pyrophosphatases (mPPases) are homodimeric proteins that hydrolyse pyrophosphate and pump H+/Na+ across membranes. They are crucial for the virulence of protist pathogens, making them attractive drug targets. In this study, we investigate the inhibitory effects of seven distinct bisphosphonates against Thermotoga maritima mPPase to explore their mode of action and assist in future small molecule inhibitor development. We solved two structures of mPPase bound to the inhibitors in the enzyme active sites and probed the conformational dynamics of mPPase under multiple inhibitors and functionally relevant conditions by double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy. We found that mPPase adopts distinct conformational equilibria in solution in the presence of different inhibitors, including states consistent with asymmetric binding in the active site (closed-open), but a symmetric apo-like conformation on the periplasmic side (open-open). Combined with solid-supported membrane-based electrophysiology recordings, this revealed that during catalysis, one monomer of the dimer remains open, and Na+ can only be pumped in a closed state. These results further support symmetry-breaking across the membrane, consistent with half-of-the-sites-reactivity."
"We examined the effects of X-ray irradiation on Xenopus laevis, focusing on pre- and post-fertilization exposure. We applied X-ray doses of 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 Gy. Fifty percent of the 360 eggs irradiated at 250 Gy failed to fertilize, while fertilized eggs developed normally until the gastrula stage. Doses ranging from 10 to 250 Gy caused developmental anomalies. High mortality rates were observed at doses of 100 to 500 Gy. Post-fertilization irradiation at 50 to 100 Gy resulted in 100% lethality, while exposure to 10 Gy led to only 13% lethality, although both exposure levels produced similar types of developmental anomalies compared to pre-fertilization irradiation. This study highlights how the timing and intensity of exposure critically affect embryo viability, especially during the sensitive stages of fertilization and gastrulation. We establish the necessary and sufficient dosage to further investigate the molecular mechanisms of X-ray damage to DNA and protein.

HighlightHigh doses of electromagnetic radiation pre- and post-fertilization produce different developmental outcomes in Xenopus laevis."
"The temporal evolution of brain activity relies on complex interactions within and between brain regions that are mediated by neurobiology and connectivity. To understand these interactions, many large-scale efforts have measured structural connectivity, neural activity, gene expression, and cognition across multiple modalities and species. However, data-driven discovery of large-scale activity models remains difficult owing to the lack of flexible quantitative frameworks for estimating the interplay between brain structure and function while preserving biophysical realism. Here, we provide such a framework by integrating network control theory (NCT) with automatic differentiation to estimate model parameters with greater biophysical realism from data. Specifically, we estimate the structural form of regional self-inhibition--a quantity that is experimentally difficult to measure--from MRI data. Next, we demonstrate that the resulting model-based self-inhibition parameters correlate significantly with regions intrinsic neural timescales (INTs), neurobiological measures of gene expression and cell-type densities, as well as behavioral measures of cognition. We demonstrate consistent results across multiple datasets and species. Finally, we demonstrate that our self-inhibition parameters enable the efficient control of brain dynamics from fewer brain regions. Taken together, our results provide a simple and flexible quantitative framework that more accurately captures the interplay between brain structure, function, and dynamics with greater biophysical realism."
"The Germ Cell Theory, rooted in developmental biology1, has significantly advanced both the understanding and curative treatment of rare germ cell cancers (GCCs)2. In contrast, somatic cancer research - long dominated by the Somatic Mutation Theory - has stagnated due to fragmented, mutation- centric approaches that lack a unifying conceptual framework and have yielded only limited clinical progress3. GCC research identifies non-somatic human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) as the cells of origin for GCCs1,4. In somatic cancers, although the cancer stem cell theory is gaining acceptance, cancer stem cells are assumed to be of somatic origin, with their exact identity undefined5. Accumulating experimental evidence and clinical observations challenge the traditional separation between GCCs and somatic cancers, including malignant somatic transformation (MST) - the emergence of somatic cancer phenotypes from GCCs, often without new mutations2, 6-8 - suggesting that hPGCs may also initiate somatic cancers. However, no experimental model of MST has been established9. Merkel cell polyomavirus-positive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a highly aggressive somatic cancer with paradoxically stable genomes resembling those of GCCs10-12, offers a unique model to test germ cell theory-based somatic oncogenesis. Here we present an MST mouse model linking hPGC origin to somatic cancer by inducing virus-positive MCC-like tumors in vivo from virus-transfected hPGC-like cells or human iPSCs competent for hPGC specification with an obligatory late-hPGC state preceding MST. This genetically simple, molecularly tractable model provides a novel platform to dissect VP-MCC pathogenesis and broadly advocates a developmental biology framework for somatic cancer research beyond mutation-centric and soma-centric paradigms."
"Epistasis, where a mutations effect depends on genetic background, is central to evolution. A striking pattern, global epistasis, results in fitness effects varying systematically with background fitness--often making beneficial mutations less effective in fitter genotypes. Despite its ubiquity and importance in predicting evolution, the cellular origin of this pattern is unclear. We present a microbial cell growth model and show that global epistasis arises naturally from the underlying metabolic structure, and is modulated by reaction speeds and flux redistribution in the cell. Mutations in standalone rate-limiting modules yield predictable fitness effects, while those in interconnected modules behave idiosyncratically. As genetic divergence increases, background fitness becomes a poorer predictor of fitness effects. Our framework links cellular metabolism to adaptation, offering mechanistic insights into evolutionary predictability."
"Recombinases catalyze site-specific integration, excision, and inversion of DNA and are found in myriad defense islands; however, their function in phage-defense is unknown as they are frequently dismissed as markers of prophages. Here, we characterize the physiological role of the previously-uncharacterized serine recombinase PinR of Escherichia coli cryptic prophage rac and discover that it inhibits T2 phage infection by inverting a 1,797 bp segment in a different cryptic prophage e14 to inhibit T2 infection; this inversion leads to the formation of a novel protein from two spliced genes, StfE2, that we find blocks phage adsorption. Modeling shows StfE2 inhibits T2 phage adsorption by preventing Gp38 binding to its primary receptors porins FadL and OmpF. Corroborating the receptor-blocking hypothesis, T2 escape mutants evolve resistance to PinR phage defense by mutating gp38 to remove 16 aa in the hyper variable region 3. Therefore, we discovered the first recombinase-activated phage inhibition system."
"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa poses a critical global health challenge, with current diagnostics relying on slow, culture-based methods. Here, we present a ML framework leveraging transcriptomic data to predict antibiotic resistance with high accuracy. We applied a genetic algorithm to 414 clinical isolates to identify minimal, highly predictive gene sets ([~]35-40 genes) distinguishing resistant from susceptible strains for meropenem, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, and ceftazidime. Automated ML classifiers trained on these sets achieved accuracies of 96-99% on test data (F1 scores: 0.93-0.99), surpassing clinical deployment thresholds. Multiple distinct, non-overlapping gene subsets exhibited comparable performance, indicating that resistance acquisition broadly impacts the expression of diverse regulatory and metabolic genes. Comparison with known resistance markers from CARD and operon annotations revealed a substantial number of previously unannotated clusters, highlighting significant knowledge gaps in current AMR understanding. Mapping these genes onto independently modulated gene sets (iModulons) revealed transcriptional adaptations across diverse genetic regions. Overall, this study presents a streamlined machine-learning workflow for transcriptomic data and offers a pathway toward rapid diagnostics and personalized treatment strategies against AMR."
"The amphibian endemic fauna from Madagascar is currently facing multiple threats, including habitat loss, climate change and invasive species. Many species are listed as threatened by the IUCN, but long-term monitoring is scarce and assessments rarely account for population trends. Using a 13-year amphibian survey in the Strict Nature Reserve of Betampona (eastern Madagascar), we assessed the population trends of 38 species between 2010 and 2022 based on amphibian activity. Despite the high protecction status of the reserve, we found a negative trend for 15 species, a positive trend for 13 species increasing and 13 species with no significant trend detected. We propose to update the status of 15 species towards a threatened category (CR, EN, VU). Contrasting population trends in amphibians from Betampona might modify species composition and ecosystem functions in the future. This study highlights an important underestimation of extinction risks for a large proportion of amphibians from Madagascar, and more generally in the tropics where long-term population trends are poorly documented."
"Fish actively control posture in the pitch axis (nose-up/nose-down) to counter instability and regulate their elevation in the water column. To test the hypothesis that environmental cues shape strategies fish use to control posture, we leveraged a serendipitous finding: larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) lose swim bladder volume and sink mildly after acute loss of lateral line hair cells. Using long-term (48 h) recordings of unrestrained swimming, we discovered that sinking larvae compensated differently depending on light conditions. In the dark, they swim more frequently with an increased nose-up posture. In contrast, larvae in the light do not swim more frequently, but do climb more often. Finally, after lateral line regeneration, larvae returned to normal buoyancy and swam comparably to control siblings. We conclude that larvae can switch postural control strategies depending on the availability of visual information. Our findings complement and extend morphological and kinematic analyses of locomotion. More broadly, by quantifying the variation in strategies our work speaks to the evolutionary substrate for different balance behaviors."
"Understanding seizure duration is crucial for predicting seizure evolution and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. This study investigates how changes in neural connectivity patterns estimated in a Neural Mass Model (NMM) relate to seizure duration and whether these parameters can be used to forecast seizure duration. We applied a biologically plausible NMM to intracranial EEG recordings from a Tetanus Toxin rat model of epilepsy. Model parameters, representing synaptic connectivity strengths between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations across different cortical layers, were estimated using the Unscented Kalman Filter. A Random Forest classifier was trained to predict seizure duration (short vs. long) based on these connectivity parameters. We assessed the classification performance using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC). Our findings reveal that stronger excitatory-to-excitatory connectivity before seizure onset was associated with longer seizure durations. In contrast, inhibitory-to-inhibitory and excitatory-to-inhibitory connectivity strengths decreased before long seizures. The Random Forest classifier achieved an AUC of 0.91 when using both preictal (1 minute before seizure onset) and early ictal (first 5 seconds of the seizures) parameters, demonstrating excellent predictive power. Classification using only preictal parameters resulted in an AUC of 0.70. Our study highlights the critical role of preictal neural connectivity in determining seizure duration. The findings suggest that network excitability and inhibitory control before seizure onset influence how long seizures persist. These insights provide a foundation for personalized, time-based therapeutic interventions and seizure management strategies, ultimately improving the quality of life of patients with epilepsy."
"BackgroundAnesthesia decreases core body temperature, and this seriously compromises the physiological status of an experimental animal. Hypothermia alters many aspects of neural function. When recording nervous system activity in anesthetized animals, their core temperature must be stabilized.

New methodThis report describes an inexpensive, battery-powered, temperature-controlled warming pad for mice and rats and documents its validity and utility. The device is portable, making it convenient for researchers who conduct procedures such as surgical preparations in one location and transport the anesthetized animal to another location for experimental recordings.

ResultsThe device keeps anesthetized mice normothermic {+/-}0.7{degrees} for over 6 hours without supplemental warmth (e.g., heat lamp), despite >15{degrees} differential between ambient room temperature and core body temperature. We demonstrate how the warming pad can be used for in vivo imaging of neuronal activity for a prolonged period in mice.

Comparison with existing methodsCommercial heating pads for small animals are expensive, somewhat bulky, and require power cords and a 120/240V source. Transporting an anesthetized animal from one location (e.g. surgical suite) to another (e.g., imaging rig) involves moving power cords. Moreover, commercial devices are not always compatible with custom stereotaxic frames, microscope stages, or holding boxes. The device described here is small, inexpensive, battery-powered, and readily adaptable to experimental set ups.

ConclusionThe homeothermic heating pad provides a simple method for maintaining the core temperature of anesthetized small animals. It can be constructed in under 30 minutes, the components are readily available, and the cost is less than $100. It is exceptionally useful for experiments on mice or rats.

"Growth is a dynamic activity of simultaneous biological processes happening at multiple time-scales varying from orders of fractions of a second to several years. Rather than modeling growth with differential equations, this multiple time-scale dynamics is modeled using a simpler algebraic approach that involves continued fraction of the linear time scale. This algebraic approach offers models that are infinitely differentiable like an exponential function but also robust and superposable like linear equations. Thus, unique insights into growth dynamics can be obtained without much need of a calculus background. Growth of bacterial colonies, yeast cultures, Drosophila population, mean individual attributes of Helianthus and rats have already been modeled using this approach. In this work, we extend the modeling procedure to individual human growth using Montbeillards height measurements of his son starting from birth upto almost 18 years of age. Good fits are obtained on the data and growth rates are estimated directly from the model. Thus, this methodology provides generic, flexible, simpler and more interpretable growth models."
"We simulate and formally analyze the emergent operations from the specific anatomical layout and physiological activation patterns of a particular local excitatory-inhibitory circuit architecture that occurs throughout superficial layers of cortex. The circuit carries out two effective procedures on its inputs, depending on the strength of its local feedback inhibitory cells. Both procedures can be formally characterized in terms of well-studied statistical operations: clustering, and component analyses, under high-feedback-inhibition and low-feedback-inhibition conditions, respectively. The detailed nature of these clustering and component procedures is studied in the context of extensive related literatures in statistics, machine learning, and computational neuroscience. The two operations (clustering and component analysis) have not previously been shown to contain deep connections, let alone to each be derivable from a single overarching algorithmic precursor. The identification of this deep formal mathematical connection, which arose from analysis of a detailed biological circuit, represents a rare instance of novel mathematical relations arising from biological analyses. 1"
"Domestic dog exhibits remarkable phenotypic diversity and provides versatile models for genomics, evolution, and complex traits. DNA sequences and stable RNAs have revealed regulatory regions in the dog genome. However, transcriptional activity, regulatory architecture, and control of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) across genes and enhancers remain uncharacterized. Here, we track transcription at nucleotide-resolution, measure RNA expression and stability, and analyse mechanisms of Pol II regulation in golden retriever macrophages. We report the precise architectures of promoters, enhancers, and enhancer clusters, and quantify Pol II progression from the initiation, through the pause-region, into elongation and termination. Triggering transcriptional change by heat stress reveals instant reprogramming of genes via promoter-proximal pause-regulation and enhancers via initiation. Enhancers within a cluster mount a unified response. This study identifies functional genomic regions de novo, characterizes transcriptional architectures of genes, enhancers, and enhancer clusters, quantifies RNA synthesis and stability, and reveals mechanisms of transcription in Canis lupus familiaris."
"Age is an important risk factor for infections such as tuberculosis (TB). Telomerase is expressed in immune cells yet leukocyte telomere length declines during ageing suggesting an age-dependent loss of telomerase activity in the immune system. Leukocyte telomere length has been correlated with worse outcomes in TB patients, however the mechanisms linking telomere biology to TB susceptibility and response to therapy are unexplored. Here we use the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum model to investigate the role of telomerase in TB resistance. We find depletion and inhibition of Tert, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, increases bacterial burden in zebrafish embryos while small molecule activation of Tert decreases bacterial burden. Depletion of shelterin components did not recapitulate the infection susceptibility phenotype, and infection susceptibility could not be rescued by p53 or STING depletion. Consistent with a previously described role for Tert in developmental hematopoiesis, we find Tert is necessary for demand-driven emergency myelopoiesis to support containment of extended mycobacterial infection. Our findings establish a previously undescribed role for host telomerase in supporting infection demand-driven hematopoiesis to control infection."
"We introduce a novel approach for analyzing expression data by integrating patient-level expression profiles with a Protein-Protein interaction network from the STRING database. Our pipeline leverages motif mining to identify recurring sets (motifs) of interacting biomolecules characterized by specific expression patterns, providing deeper insights into underlying biological processes. We applied our method to a publicly available dataset of plasma protein measurements from patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 and compared the motif features to those found by conventional differential expression analysis. Motif features demonstrated better performance in classification models and hierarchical clustering. Of note, they were able to resolve interpatient variability during clustering, while traditional features failed to do so. Interestingly, these discriminatory performances were achieved using a smaller and largely different set of proteins. Motif mining is a highly flexible method with capacity to integrate multiple modes of data and presents an exciting line of analysis for biomarker discovery as well as general biology."
"Microbotryum superbum (MvSup), M. intermedium (MI), and M. lychnidis-dioicae (MVLG) are members of the M. violaceum fungal complex. Each species infects specific host plant species, resulting in what is commonly known as anther smut. The lifecycle of these basidiomycete fungi includes the haploid, mating, and infection stages. RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process where adenosine (A) is converted to inosine (I) by adenosine deaminase enzymes (ADARs); such modifications to RNAs may lead to synonymous and nonsynonymous codon changes, thereby altering protein function. We observed that 57% to 77% of total editing sites created nonsynonymous codon changes in both haploid and mating stages of the three species. Moreover, the a2 haploid strain of MI had fewer editing sites compared to other haploid strains. When we compared amino acid substitutions, we found that in both haploids of MvSup and MVLG, Ala was the preferred codon after nonsynonymous codon changes. Among the edited genes, two were edited only at the mating stage in MvSup, undergoing A to I changes within the regions encoding their functional domains. Differential expression analysis revealed that the gene annotated as Apoptosis-inducing factor-1, was upregulated in MvSup at the mating stage, while another gene, for PHB domain-containing protein responsible for cell proliferation, was downregulated compared to the haploid stage. During all stages of the MvSup lifecycle examined, a specific MAPKKK gene was edited in the portion encoding the PKC-like superfamily domain. Also, that gene was edited at a second site during haploid and mating stages but not during the infection stage. Research on RNA editing in basidiomycetes has been limited and is relatively new. RNA editing mechanisms in fungi have been implicated in fungal pathogenesis, although the exact mechanisms and implications remain unclear. Further research is needed to fully understand functional significance of this apparently ubiquitous process in several members of the Microbotryum fungal complex, with possible ramifications more generally in fungi."
"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clinical syndrome characterized primarily by hepatocellular steatosis and lipid accumulation, which leads to hepatocyte apoptosis, autophagy, inflammation, and intracellular oxidative stress. NAFLD is recognized as one of the most prevalent and complex chronic liver diseases globally, with its occurrence and associated mortality rates rising swiftly each year. Due to the high similarity between chicken fatty liver syndrome (FLS) and NAFLD, as well as the easy availability of diseased chickens, the chicken is considered an ideal model for studying the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Previous studies have pinpointed several circular RNAs (circRNAs) implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, yet the underlying functions and mechanisms of numerous circRNAs continue to remain elusive. In this experiment, we utilized circRNA sequencing of chicken livers to identify a novel circRNA, named circACACA, and discovered that it disrupts the metabolic homeostasis of lipids within hepatocytes. Consequently, this disruption leads to oxidative stress and the induction of autophagy, ultimately exerting an adverse effect on chicken liver health. Mechanistically, circACACA functions as a molecular sponge for miR-132b-5p and miR-101-2-5p to modulate the expression of the downstream CBFB/PIM1 complex. Consequently, it influenced the activity of the AKT/mTOR and PPAR-{gamma} signaling pathways to perform its physiological functions. Crucially, we noticed substantial sequence similarity of circACACA across diverse species by comprehensively searching databases. Further, our research with a mouse model confirmed that the functional conservation of circACACA across livers of different species. Overall, this study built a mechanistic network for circACACA and confirmed its sequence conservation and functional relevance across various species. Our results not only provide new targets for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD but also present fresh perspectives for progress in healthy production of laying hens."
"Adequate oxygen supply is crucial for proper cellular function. The emergence of high-throughput (HT) expansion of human stem-cell-derived cells and HT in vitro cellular assays for drug testing necessitate monitoring and understanding of the oxygenation conditions, yet virtually no data exists for such settings. For metabolically active cells like cardiomyocytes, variations in oxygenation may significantly impact their maturation and function; conversely, electromechanical activity can drive oxygen demands. We used HT label-free optical measurements and computational modeling to gain insights about oxygen availability (peri-cellular oxygen dynamics) in syncytia of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and human cardiac fibroblasts (cFB) grown in glass-bottom 96-well plates under static conditions. Our experimental results highlight the critical role of cell density and solution height (oxygen delivery path) in peri-cellular oxygen dynamics. The developed 3D reaction-diffusion model with Michaelis-Menten kinetics, trained on the obtained comprehensive data set, revealed that time-variant maximum oxygen consumption rate, Vmax, is needed to faithfully capture the complex peri-cellular oxygen dynamics in the excitable hiPSC-CMs, but not in the cFB. For the latter, accounting for cell proliferation was needed. Interestingly, we found both hypoxic (< 2%) and hyperoxic (> 7%) conditions can easily emerge in these standard HT plates in static culture and that peri-cellular oxygen dynamics evolves with days in culture. Our results and the developed computational model can directly be used to optimize cardiac cell growth in HT plates to achieve desired physiological conditions, important in cellular assays for cardiotoxicity, drug development, personalized medicine and heart regeneration applications."
"As the seat of our cognition, the human neocortex is an object of immense fascination. Human neocortex expansion during evolution has been attributed to an increase in the proliferative capacity of neural progenitor cells during development, particularly basal radial glia (bRG). Despite their evolutionary relevance, the genomic changes driving human-specific bRG biology remain uncharacterized. We used comparative chromatin and transcriptional profiling of neural progenitor cells isolated from gorilla, chimpanzee and human cerebral organoids to identify cis-regulatory elements that have gained activity in humans. Focusing specifically on bRG, we discovered that morphoregulatory enhancer activity and gene expression signatures distinguish human bRG from other great apes. Functional analysis of the morphoregulatory genes FAM107A and CNGA3 in human organoids revealed that these genes are required for the morphological complexity of human bRG. Taken together, our interspecies comparison of basal radial glia suggests that human-specific morphoregulatory signatures characterize neocortex evolution."
"BackgroundSchistosomiasis, a major neglected tropical disease, is currently treated with only one drug, praziquantel (PZQ), effective only against adult worms. However, high reinfection rates and potential development of drug resistance following widespread use of PZQ emphasize the need for a deeper molecular understanding of the host-parasite crosstalk as a basis for urgently needed novel drugs. Here, we identify and characterize a soluble host-derived schistosomicidal phospholipase that influences the diacylglycerophospholipid metabolism and, thereby, the survival and development of Schistosoma mansoni.

MethodsLarge-scale proteomic screening identified host platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAFAH) as a potential schistosomicidal factor. Ultra-performance tandem mass spectrometry and electron microscopy imaging were employed to demonstrate the relevance and the lethal effects of recombinant expressed mouse PAFAH (MsPAFAH) on all juvenile stages and adult parasites from a mouse model of schistosomiasis. Quantitative lipidomic analysis revealed MsPAFAH-impaired glycerophospholipid distribution and metabolism and following free fatty acid supplementation.

ResultsMsPAFAH was upregulated in schistosome-infected mice and exhibited potent schistosomicidal activity against all parasite life stages ex vivo. In contrast, human PAFAH had no effect on parasite viability. MsPAFAH treatment led to profound impairments in worm fecundity, pairing stability, reproductive organ integrity, and stem cell development. This activity was associated with substantial sex-dependent changes in ether-phospholipid composition and distribution within the schistosome tegument. MsPAFAH specifically decreased the availability of phospholipid species containing unsaturated fatty acids, namely eicosenoic (20:1) and docosatetraenoic acid (22:4), while increasing levels of respective hydrolysis (lyso) products of diacyl- and ether-phospholipids (carrying 20:1 or stearic acid (18:0)), predominantly in males. Supplementation of metabolized fatty acids C20:1/eicosenoic acid and 22:4/adrenic acid rescued the viability of female worms, confirming the essential role of the metabolism of these diacylglycerophospholipids in schistosome survival.

ConclusionsThese findings unravel how a host phospholipase interferes with schistosome biology and development by regulating diacylglycerophospholipid availability and can thus open new avenues for schistosomiasis drug development and control."
"Predicting an individuals behaviour in one task based on their behaviour in a different task is a key challenge in modeling individual decision-making tendencies. We propose a novel framework that addresses this challenge by leveraging neural networks and introducing a concept we term the ""individuality index."" This index, extracted from behaviour in a ""source"" task via an encoder network, captures an individuals unique decision-making tendencies. A decoder network then utilizes this index to generate the weights of a task-specific neural network (a ""task solver""), which predicts the individuals behaviour in a ""target"" task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in two distinct decision-making tasks: a value-guided task and a perceptual task. Our framework offers a robust and generalizable approach for parameterizing individuality, providing a promising pathway toward computational modeling at the individual level--that is, replicating individuals in silico."
"Knowing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is important for understanding various biological mechanisms. In this paper, we present a method, QWENDY, that uses single-cell gene expression data measured at four time points to infer GRNs. Based on a linear gene expression model, it solves the transformation for the covariance matrices. Unlike its predecessor WENDY, QWENDY avoids solving a non-convex optimization problem and produces a unique solution. Then we enhance QWENDY by the transformer neural networks and large language models to obtain two variants: TEQWENDY and LEQWENDY. We test the performance of these methods on two experimental data sets and two synthetic data sets. TEQWENDY has the best overall performance, while QWENDY ranks the first on experimental data sets."
"Current diagnostic approaches for myocardial infarction (MI) rely on blood-based cardiac biomarker analysis by centralized instruments, often delaying timely clinical decisions. We present a microneedle-based capacitive biosensor (MiCaP) for in situ, minimally invasive monitoring of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in interstitial fluid (ISF) for point-of-care (POC) applications. MiCaP is a label-free biosensor operating based on non-faradaic sensing by monitoring electric double layer capacitance at the microneedle-ISF interface. We extracted a simplified equivalent circuit model for MiCaP inserted into skin, confirming that the measured capacitance variations originate from cTnI binding to surface-immobilized antibodies. MiCaP was fabricated using a scalable process and functionalized with anti-cTnI antibodies. In vitro measurements showed a dynamic detection range of 10 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL, a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.27 pg/mL, and a total assay turnaround time of less than 15 minutes. A spike-and-recovery test using cTnI-spiked human serum yielded a recovery accuracy exceeding 93%. In vivo studies in rats demonstrated ISF cTnI levels of 3 {+/-} 0.4 pg/mL in controls and 912 {+/-} 683 pg/mL in experimental animals, indicating an increasing trend consistent with serum concentrations measured using a clinical immunoassay. These results support the potential of MiCaP as a minimally invasive biosensing platform for cardiac biomarker monitoring, with possible extension to multiplexed ISF-based diagnostics in POC."
"A major goal of neuroscience is to identify whether there are generalized principles that can explain the diverse structures and functions of the brain. The principle of temporal prediction provides one approach, arguing that the sensory brain is optimized to represent stimulus features that efficiently predict the immediate future input. Previous work has demonstrated that feedforward hierarchical temporal prediction models can capture the tuning properties of neurons along the visual pathway, and that recurrent temporal prediction models can explain local functional connectivity within primary visual cortex. However, the visual system is also characterized by extensive inter-areal feedback recurrency, which existing models lack. We aimed to better account for the dynamic features of neurons in the visual cortex by incorporating both local recurrency and inter-areal feedback connectivity into a hierarchical temporal prediction model. The resulting model captured tuning for pattern motion, surround suppression and elements of inter-areal functional connectivity in visual cortex. Moreover, compared with several alternative normative models, the hierarchical recurrent temporal prediction model provided the closest fit to these tuning properties and was best able to explain the emergence of neuronal response properties across the visual cortex. Accordingly, temporal prediction can account for information processing throughout the visual pathway.

Author summaryTask-driven artificial neural networks have provided valuable insights into the computational operations performed by neurons in the brain. In particular, models trained on various normative principles have been shown to capture some of the feature selectivity of neurons in the visual system. However, these models generally ignore the substantial role of inter-areal feedback connectivity in neural function. This study presents an alternative approach to understanding the neural computations underlying the functional organization of the visual system, by providing compelling evidence that networks trained for temporal prediction can explain the emergence of higher-level response properties across the visual cortex and relating these features to both local and inter-areal feedback connectivity."
"Zygnematophytes are the closest algal relatives of land plants. They hold key information to infer how the earliest land plants overcame the barrage of terrestrial stressors, prime of which is osmotic stress. Here, we applied two osmotic stressors on a unicellular and a multicellular representative of zygnematophytes and studied their response over a 25-hour time course generating 130, 60, and 30 of transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic samples combined with photophysiology, sugar analysis, immunocytochemical glycoprotein analysis, and microscopy. Our data highlight a shared protein chassis that shows divergent responses with the same outcome: successful acclimation to osmotic challenges. We establish a model of how the algal sisters of land plants can overcome a prime stressor in the terrestrial habitat and highlight components of the plant terrestrialization toolkit."
"Astrocyte cilia are largely understudied due to the lack of available tools. Astrocyte research advanced with the establishment of Aldh1l1-CreERT2, an inducible Cre line that specifically targets the astrocyte lineage. Here, we develop and compare genetic models that label astrocyte cilia in the developing prefrontal cortex (PFC) using Aldh1l1-CreERT2 and Cre-dependent cilia reporters. We evaluate these models by testing different tamoxifen-induction protocols and quantifying the percentage of astrocytes labeled with the cilia reporters. We show that tamoxifen dosage impacts the expression of cilia reporters in astrocytes. We validate the maximum cilia-labeling efficiency of tamoxifen using constitutively-expressed cilia reporters. The data reveal that only a subset of SOX9- positive astrocytes in the PFC possess cilia throughout development. Our work highlights the utility of Cre-Lox systems to target specific cell types and the importance of carefully validating genetic models."
"RNA plays vital roles in diverse biological processes, thus drawing much attention as potential drug target. Structure Based Drug Design (SBDD) for RNA is a promising approach but available RNA-ligand complex tertiary structures are substantially limited so far. Then, theoretical RNA-ligand docking simulations play central roles. However, success of SBDD highly depends on use of RNA structure sufficiently close to ligand-boundable conformations, which do not necessarily appear in experimentally-resolved and theoretically sampled apo RNA conformations. To overcome such difficulty in SBDD for RNA, we leverage efficiently sampling ligand-boudable apo RNA conformations by using a generative deep learning model (DL). We succeeded to generate HIV-1 Transactivation Response Element (TAR) conformations with a cryptic MV2003 binding cavity without a priori knowledge of the cavity. These conformations bind to MV2003 with binding scores similar to those calculated for experimentally-resolved TAR-MV2003 complexes, illustrating new application of DL to promote SBDD for RNA."
"Alterations in the gut microbiome constitute a feature of aging and therefore represent a therapeutic target for aging-related diseases. In this study, we investigated the impact of ketogenic interventions on the microbiome of mice genetically predisposed to Alzheimers disease (AD). AD mice exhibited several microbial alterations, notably increased levels of Bifidobacterium and decreased levels of Bacteroidetes. Ketogenic interventions, either a medium-chain triglyceride-enriched diet (MCT) or carbohydrate-free high-fat diet (CFHF), administered for 1 month restored the levels of more than 50% of the bacteria altered in AD mice, including a strong reduction in Bifidobacterium levels. Ketogenic interventions induced a shift in the gut microbiome associated with increased levels of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, such as Lachnospiraceae and Muribaculaceae. MCT and CFHF also triggered diet-specific microbial changes, which may contribute to the distinct physiological effects of these diets. In conclusion, ketogenic interventions may influence AD pathophysiology by modulating the gut microbiome."
"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 is circulating widely in lactating cows in the United States. Due to the critical need for intervention strategies for this outbreak, we evaluated antibody and cellular immune responses of a clade 2.3.4.4b H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine in calves. We found that the H5 mRNA-LNP vaccine induced a robust antibody and CD8+ T cellular-mediated immune response and conferred protection against clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 infection."
"The efficacy of T cell-activating therapies against glioma is limited by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and tumor-induced T cell sequestration. We investigated whether peripherally infused non-antigen specific autologous lymphocytes (ALT) could accumulate in intracranial tumors. We observed that non-specific autologous CD8+ ALT cells can indeed accumulate in this context, despite endogenous T cell sequestration in bone marrow. Rates of intratumoral accumulation were markedly increased when expanding lymphocytes with IL-7 compared to IL-2. Pre-treatment with IL-7 ALT also enhanced the efficacy of multiple tumor-specific and non-tumor-specific T cell-dependent immunotherapies against orthotopic murine and human xenograft gliomas. Mechanistically, we detected increased VLA-4 on mouse and human CD8+ T cells following IL-7 expansion, with increased transcription of genes associated with migratory integrin expression (CD9). We also observed that IL-7 increases S1PR1 transcription in human CD8+ T cells, which we have shown to be protective against tumor-induced T cell sequestration. These observations demonstrate that expansion with IL-7 enhances the capacity of ALT to accumulate within intracranial tumors, and that pre-treatment with IL-7 ALT can boost the efficacy of subsequent T cell-activating therapies against glioma. Our findings will inform the development of future clinical trials where ALT pre-treatment can be combined with T cell-activating therapies.

Brief SummaryT cell immunotherapies are limited by few T cells in glioma. Adoptively transferred lymphocytes expanded with IL-7 exhibit increased VLA-4 expression and accumulate in tumors."
"GABAergic neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) play a crucial role in auditory processing by extracting specific features of sounds (Ono et al., 2005). The Gad67-GFP mouse model developed by Tamamaki et al. in 2003 on a Swiss background facilitates studying these neurons by using a green fluorescent protein that is expressed endogenously via the GAD67 promoter. Unfortunately, this mouse suffers from accelerated aging-related hearing loss, limiting its utility in studying the auditory system. Here, we report the results of an 8-generation backcross of this line onto CBA/CaJ mice, which produces mice with stable low-threshold hearing while retaining GFP expression in GAD+ neurons. Additionally, this study investigates mechanisms that underlie hearing loss in the Gad67-GFP mouse model by focusing specifically on cochlear hair cells (HCs) and ribbon synapses, which may contribute to both model-specific hearing loss and clinical disorders like presbycusis. Findings revealed the newly generated F1 mouse model that resulted from the Gad67-GFP x CBA/CaJ backcross maintained better hearing thresholds when compared to ABR data for Gad67 and Swiss mice and very closely resembled those of the CBA/CaJ mice, mirroring progression of presbycusis in humans. Additionally, all morphological changes observed in cochlear structure correlated to ABR thresholds. F1 mice continued maintained expression of the GAD67 promoter in the IC via immunostaining."
"SummaryPairwise sequence similarity is a core operation in genomic analysis, yet most attention has been given to sequences made up of discrete characters. With the growing prevalence of machine learning, calculating similarities for sequences of continuous representations, e.g. frequency-based position-weight matrices (PWMs), attribution-based contribution-weight matrices, and even learned embeddings, is taking on newfound importance. Tomtom has previously been proposed as an algorithm for identifying pairs of PWMs whose similarity is statistically significant, but the implementation remains inefficient for both real-time and large-scale analysis. Accordingly, we have re-implemented Tomtom as a numba-accelerated Python function that is natively multi-threaded, avoids cache misses, more efficiently caches intermediate values, and uses approximations at compute bottlenecks. Here, we provide a detailed description of the original Tomtom method (see Supplementary Note 1) and present results demonstrating that our re-implementation can achieve over a thousand-fold speedup compared with the original tool on reasonable tasks (see Supplementary Note 2).

Availability and ImplementationOur implementation of Tomtom is freely available as a Python package at https://github.com/jmschrei/memesuite-lite, which can be downloaded via pip install memelite."
"Cell-to-cell variation within clonal bacterial populations provides bacterial communities important advantages including opportunities for bet-hedging and metabolic division of labor. In recent years the extent of bacterial heterogeneity has been documented both at the transcriptome level and with physiological measurements of cell growth rate and translation rate. However, methods that link physiological parameters to a single cells full transcriptomic state are lacking, making it difficult to identify the regulatory mechanisms that couple physiology and transcriptional output. Here we introduce a method that combines click-chemistry enabled labeling of nascent polypeptides to measure translation rates in single cells alongside microfluidic encapsulation and single cell transcriptomic measurements, providing a tandem measurement of translation rate and transcriptome in thousands of single Bacillus subtilis cells. In a culture experiencing nutrient limitation, we identified a subpopulation of cells with a higher rate of protein translation that uniquely overexpresses genes for several metabolic processes including acetoin production and arginine synthesis. Using a genetic approach informed by the gene expression in this subpopulation, we identified a regulatory mechanism that couples the increase in protein abundance of a transcriptional regulator AlsR with expression of alsR regulated genes in this subpopulation."
"The modulatory neurotransmitter norepinephrine and activation of {beta}-adrenergic receptors ({beta}-ARs) has a crucial role in hippocampus-dependent forms of learning. Although {beta}-AR activation also facilitates the induction of Hebbian LTP at excitatory synapses in the hippocampus, recent findings indicate that a non-Hebbian form of synaptic plasticity, known as behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), underlies hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. Because little is known about the role of noradrenergic signaling in BTSP, I examined the effects of the {beta}-AR activation on a BTSP-like, complex spike (CS) burst-dependent form of LTP induced by theta-pulse stimulation (TPS) protocols in the CA1 region of mouse hippocampal slices. I find that {beta}-AR activation not only enhances the homosynaptic potentiation of synaptic transmission induced by TPS but also regulates how synapses interact during the induction of CS burst-dependent LTP. The ability of synapses to interact in a cooperative fashion to undergo CS burst-dependent LTP, which is mediated by a heterosynaptic facilitation of EPSP-evoked CS bursting induced by brief trains of TPS, was enhanced by {beta}-AR activation. Moreover, unlike conventional Hebbian LTP, where cooperative LTP induction requires near synchronous coactivation of synapses, {beta}-AR activation enabled the induction of CS burst-dependent LTP by cooperative interactions between synapses activated up to ten seconds apart. {beta}-AR activation also enhanced a potent form of synaptic competition that emerges during longer trains of TPS. This effect of {beta}-AR activation is mediated by a CS burst-dependent form of heterosynaptic depression and produces an unusual, bidirectional modulation of LTP induction where the {beta}-AR-mediated facilitation of homosynaptic LTP induction produces a heterosynaptic suppression of LTP induction at other synapses. Together, these findings indicate that {beta}-AR activation regulates fundamental properties of postsynaptic burst-dependent plasticity rules by modulating multiple forms of heterosynaptic plasticity."
"Retinal ganglion cells in the mammalian central nervous system fail to regenerate following injury, with the capacity to survive and regrow varying by cell type. This variability may be linked to differences in developmental programs that overlap with the genetic pathways that mediate regeneration. To explore this correlation, we compared the structural changes in mouse retinal ganglion cells during development with those occurring after axonal injury. The dendritic trees of over 1,000 ganglion cells were reconstructed at different developmental stages, revealing that each cell type follows a distinct timeline. ON-sustained (sON) cells reach maturity by P14, whereas ON-transient (tON) cells achieve their maximum dendritic size by P10. Modeling of the dendritic changes indicate that while sON and tON follow similar growth programs the onset of growth was later in sON. After optic nerve crush, the remodeling of dendritic architecture differed between the two cell-types. sON cells exhibited rapid dendritic shrinkage, while tON cells shrank more gradually with changes in branching features. Following injury, sON cells reverted to an earlier developmental state than tON cells. In addition, after co-deletion of PTEN and SOC3, neurons appeared to regress further back in developmental time. Our results provide evidence that a ganglion cells resilience to injury and regenerative potential is predicted by its maturation timeline. Understanding these intrinsic differences could inform targeted neuroprotective interventions."
"Bacterial swimming is mostly powered by the bacterial flagellar motor and the number of proteins involved in the flagellar motor can vary. Quantifying the proteins present in flagellar motors from a range of species delivers insight into how motility has changed throughout history and provides a platform for estimating from its genome whether a species is likely to be motile. We conducted sequence and structural homology searches for 54 flagellar pathway proteins across 11,365 bacterial genomes and developed a classifier with up to 95% accuracy that could predict whether a strain was motile or not. We then mapped the evolution of flagellar motility across the GTDB bacterial tree of life. We confirmed that the last common bacterial ancestor had flagellar motility and that the rate of loss of this motility was four-fold higher than the rate of gain. We showed that the presence of filament protein homologues was highly phylogenetically correlated with motility and that all species classified as motile contained at least one filament homologue. We calculated the rate of gain and loss for each flagellar protein and that the filament protein FliC was highly correlated with motility across the tree of life. We then measured the correlation of each flagellar motor protein with FliC and showed that the filament, rotor, and rod and hook proteins were all highly correlated with FliC, and thus with motility. We calculated the differential rates of gain and loss for each flagellar protein and quantified which genomes encoded for partial sets of flagellar proteins, indicating potential pathways by which motility could be lost. Overall, we show that filament, rod and hook and rotor proteins are conserved when flagellar motility is preserved and that the presence or absence of a FliC homologue is a good, simple predictor of whether or not a species has flagellar motility."
"Anthropized environments are significantly challenging for wild species. Rapid adaptation to such habitats is thus key for their long-term persistence. Deciphering the environmental factors associated with species tolerance to modified habitats is fundamental for understanding the genetic and connectivity patterns of individuals and the local adaptation of their populations. We studied the Giant Toad, Rhinella horribilis, from two landscapes with distinct levels of anthropogenic habitat modification, assessed their genomic diversity, structure and connectivity with ddRAD-seq genomic data, identified potential outlier loci and their relationship with environmental and physicochemical water variables, and evaluated if populations from the two study sites showed signals of parallel adaptation. Both concordant and unique patterns were found regarding landscape factors and genotype-environment associations related with the degree of anthropic modification between landscapes. Genomic structure and connectivity were significantly associated with the presence of temporary water bodies, low vegetation cover, high humidity, solar radiation, and temperature. Notably, we identified both shared and distinct outlier SNPs and annotated functional genes for the two landscapes. Genes were enriched for biological processes and metabolic pathways, which were in turn correlated with environmental and physicochemical water variables. Genes and metabolic pathways were associated mainly with embryonic development, sexual maturation and immune responses. Studies such as this one, in an often-disregarded species, illustrate how parallel and un-parallel adaptive landscape genomic patterns arise in the stressful conditions of anthropized habitats."
"The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as an important animal model for the study of host-microbiome interactions. However, information on how variation in experimental parameters contribute to microbiome structure and function in adult zebrafish is limited which complicates experimental design, interpretation of results, and may reduce reproducibility. Here we quantified the impact of two potential sources of microbiome variation - housing strategy and sampling location - on microbial diversity of adult zebrafish using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Our findings indicate that housing strategy significantly impacts gut microbiome diversity in adult fish with the highest similarity between individuals co-housed on recirculating water systems. Microbiome acclimation after housing transfer took between 14- and 21-days. Significant variation in microbiome composition was also observed across sampling sites. As in humans, fecal and intestinal microbial communities were similar and varied by sex, however each body site sampled possessed a small site-specific microbial community signature. Consistently, imputed function of these communities showed that gene family diversity is also predicted to vary by body site particularly between gut and non-gut locations. Together our work demonstrates that housing, sex, and sampling strategy all significantly impact microbial community composition and highlight the need for community wide discussions on best practices and reporting standards for adult zebrafish microbiome studies."
"The alternative calcineurin A variant CnA{beta}1 has a unique C-terminal domain that provides it with distinct subcellular localization and mechanism of action different from other calcineurin isoforms. Here, we used mice lacking CnA{beta}1s C-terminal domain (CnA{beta}1{Delta}i12) to show that the absence of this specific isoform strongly reprograms metabolism. CnA{beta}1{Delta}i12 mice on a high-fat diet showed reduced body weight, white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, and circulating triglycerides, together with enhanced insulin sensitivity. In brown adipose tissue (BAT), CnA{beta}1 deficiency increased mitochondrial content and upregulated fatty acid oxidation and thermogenic proteins, improving cold resistance. Conversely, under starvation, CnA{beta}1{Delta}i12 mice experienced rapid fat depletion and hypothermia. Importantly, BAT-specific FoxO1 knockout in CnA{beta}1{Delta}i12 mice reduced catabolism-related gene expression and partially reversed the metabolic phenotypes, increasing body weight and WAT mass. Our findings reveal a relevant role for CnA{beta}1 in orchestrating BAT metabolism, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for obesity and metabolic syndrome."
"The experimental high-throughput screening (HTS) methods, exemplified by CRISPR- based screening techniques, have revolutionized target identification in drug discovery. However, such screens frequently yield extensive, often unrelated target lists necessitating costly and time-intensive experimental evaluation and validation. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-filter strategy that integrates literature-mined targets with CRISPR/Cas9 screening outputs, systematically prioritizing the most credible candidates and thereby reducing the experimental validation burden and increasing success rate. To validate this strategy, we applied it with hand-foot syndrome (HFS), a clinically challenging side effect induced by fluoropyrimidine treatment. We identified ATF4 as a key regulator of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) toxicity in the skin and revealed forskolin as a potential therapeutic agent of HFS through the strategy. Mechanistically, forskolin triggers MEK/ERK-dependent ATF4 induction, subsequently driving 5-FU detoxification via the ATF4-mediated eIF2/I{kappa}B signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrate that this dual-filter strategy could notably accelerate drug discovery by reducing experimental validation burden after target screening."
"Understanding how genetic variability shapes responses to environmental and developmental factors is critical for advancing translational neuroscience. However, most preclinical studies rely on inbred mouse strains that do not capture the genetic complexity of human populations. One key area of translational research focuses on identifying the neural and behavioral consequences of early life trauma. Rodent models of childhood neglect, such as maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW), have been used in isogenic mouse strains like C57BL/6J (B6) to identify behavioral domains and neural loci of deficits stemming from exposure to MSEW. To understand how genetic diversity may contribute to the outcomes produced by MSEW, and thus inform future studies on the topic, we utilized the Jackson Laboratory Diversity Outbred (DO) line, a population derived from eight founder strains that exhibit broad genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. We first compared MSEW effects on social behavior in DO mice versus B6 mice, because we have previously found social behavior deficits in B6 mice with a history of MSEW. Indeed, we established that MSEW incited social motivation deficits in DO mice, in a sex-specific manner. We then expanded our investigation of DO mice to test MSEW-related changes in anxiety-like behavior, fear learning and expression, and reward-seeking. Results revealed that MSEW produces distinct, sex-specific phenotypes: female DO mice displayed reduced social motivation and elevated anxiety-like behavior, while male DO mice showed attenuated CS-evoked fear expression and diminished reward-seeking behavior. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased Fos expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in MSEW-exposed DO mice, both at baseline and following acute stress. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating genetically diverse models to better capture the nuances of early life adversity-related outcomes relevant to human populations."
"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of the transcriptional landscape of complex tissues, enabling the discovery of novel cell types and biological functions. However, the identification and classification of cells from scRNA-seq datasets remain significant challenges. To address this, we developed a new computational tool called CIA (Cluster Independent Annotation), which accurately identifies cell types across different datasets without requiring a fully annotated reference dataset or complex machine learning processes. Based on predefined cell type signatures, CIA provides a highly user-friendly and practical solution to functional annotation of single cells. Our results demonstrate that CIA outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, while also having significantly lower computational running time. Overall, CIA simplifies the process of obtaining reproducible signature-based cell assignments that can be easily interpreted through graphical summaries providing researchers with a powerful tool to explore the complex transcriptional landscape of single cells.

The CIA framework is implemented in both the Python and R programming languages, making it applicable to all main single-cell analysis frameworks, and it is available under the MIT license with its documentation at the following links:

"Surveillance of bat coronaviruses (CoVs) is of public health importance, as accumulating evidence suggests that bats are hosts of the three significant pandemic viruses, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. Studies focused on identifying different species of bat CoVs may have information cardinal for effective prevention and control of emerging zoonotic diseases. We conducted a systematic review using selected keywords (Surveillance, detection, identification, discovery, isolation, characterization, molecular methods, and Bat coronaviruses) to evaluate molecular studies on CoVs in bats. A total of 790 articles were found using the advanced search strategy of the PubMed database. Following the selection criteria, a total of 127 articles were finally chosen for full-text evaluation. Out of the total of 54 countries examined, China emerged as the country with the highest number of studies, accounting for 26% (n = 33). The sample categories consisted of faecal, urine, guano, blood, tissues, oral, and rectal swabs. The molecular detection approaches included polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques using species-specific, genus-specific, or broad-range primers. Approximately 94.5% (n = 120) of studies used PCR assays that amplified the partial RdRp gene of length ranging from 123 to 440 bp, followed by amplicon sequencing using either Sanger or next-generation sequencing technologies. Full genome sequencing was only performed in approximately 33.9% (n = 43), with metagenomics approaches being used in 15.7% (n = 20) of the studies. The higher positivity rate of bat CoVs were detected in Asia. Globally, the most predominant bat species which tested positive for CoVs were Rhinolophus, Myotis, Miniopterus, Scotophilus, Eidolon, Chaerephon, Hipposideros, and Desmodus. Continuous bat coronavirus surveillance using molecular methods and full genome sequencing is of utmost importance in detecting and characterizing viruses at molecular level and establishing the genetic diversity of new and circulating viruses."
"Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has become a powerful tool in structural biology for investigating protein structure, dynamics, and interactomics. However, short-range cross-links, defined as those connecting residues fewer than 20 positions apart, have traditionally been considered less informative and largely overlooked, leaving significant data unexplored in a systematic manner. Here, we present a system-wide analysis of short-range cross-links, demonstrating their intrinsic correlation with protein secondary structure. We introduce the X-SPAN (Cross-link Structural Pattern Analyzer) software, which integrates publicly available XL-MS datasets from system-wide experiments with AlphaFold-predicted protein structures. Our analysis reveals distinct cross-linking patterns that reflect the spatial constraints imposed by secondary structural elements. Specifically, -helices exhibit periodic cross-linking patterns consistent with their characteristic helical pitch, whereas coils and {beta}-strands display nearly monotonic distributions. A context-dependent protein grammar reinforces short-range cross-link specificity. Short-range cross-links can enhance the statistical inference of secondary structures within integrative modeling workflows. Additionally, our work establishes a framework for benchmarking AlphaFolds local prediction accuracy and provides novel quality control criteria for XL-MS experiments. We anticipate that X-SPAN and our short-range cross-link database will serve as a valuable resource for exploring local secondary structure rearrangements and their potential roles in protein function and allosteric regulation."
"Bidirectional cargo transport by kinesin and dynein is essential for cell viability and defects are linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Computational modeling suggests that the load-dependent off-rate is the strongest determinant of which motor  wins a kinesin-dynein tug-of-war, and optical tweezer experiments find that the load-dependent detachment sensitivity of transport kinesins is kinesin-3 > kinesin-2 > kinesin-1. However, in reconstituted kinesin-dynein pairs vitro, all three kinesin families compete nearly equally well against dynein. Modeling and experiments have confirmed that vertical forces inherent to the large trapping beads enhance kinesin-1 dissociation rates. In vivo, vertical forces are expected to range from negligible to dominant, depending on cargo and microtubule geometries. To investigate the detachment and reattachment kinetics of kinesin-1, 2 and 3 motors against loads oriented parallel to the microtubule, we created a DNA tensiometer comprising a DNA entropic spring attached to the microtubule on one end and a motor on the other. Kinesin dissociation rates at stall were slower than detachment rates during unloaded runs, and the complex reattachment kinetics were consistent with a weakly-bound  slip state preceding detachment. Kinesin-3 behaviors under load suggested that long KIF1A run lengths result from the concatenation of multiple short runs connected by diffusive episodes. Stochastic simulations were able to recapitulate the load-dependent detachment and reattachment kinetics for all three motors and provide direct comparison of key transition rates between families. These results provide insight into how kinesin-1, -2 and -3 families transport cargo in complex cellular geometries and compete against dynein during bidirectional transport.

Significance StatementKinesin and dynein motor proteins transport intracellular cargo bidirectionally along microtubule tracks, with the speed and directionality of transport involving competition between motor teams. We created a  DNA tensiometer that uses DNA as a spring to measure kinesin performance against loads oriented parallel to the microtubule. We find that dissociation rates for all three families of transport kinesins slow down with imposed loads. Dyneins are also thought to possess this  catch-bond behavior, meaning that both motors will hang on tightly during a tug-of-war. Building on previous work that showed combined vertical and horizontal loads cause faster detachment rates under load, we conclude that the effectiveness of kinesins during bidirectional transport depends strongly on the geometry of their cargo."
"Purine metabolism is a promising therapeutic target in cancer; however how cancer cells respond to purine shortage,particularly their adaptation and vulnerabilities, remains unclear. Using the recently developed purine shortage-inducing prodrug DRP-104 and genetic approaches, we investigated these responses in prostate, lung and glioma cancer models. We demonstrate that when de novo purine biosynthesis is compromised, cancer cells employ microtubules to assemble purinosomes, multi-protein complexes of de novo purine biosynthesis enzymes that enhance purine biosynthesis efficiency. While this process enables tumor cells to adapt to purine shortage stress, it also renders them more susceptible to the microtubule-stabilizing chemotherapeutic drug Docetaxel. Furthermore, we show that although cancer cells primarily rely on de novo purine biosynthesis, they also exploit Methylthioadenosine Phosphorylase (MTAP)-mediated purine salvage as a crucial alternative source of purine supply, especially under purine shortage stress. In support of this finding, combining DRP-104 with an MTAP inhibitor significantly enhances tumor suppression in prostate cancer (PCa) models in vivo. Finally, despite the resilience of the purine supply machinery, purine shortage-stressed tumor cells exhibit increased DNA damage and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, which may contribute to impaired immunoevasion and provide a molecular basis of the previously observed DRP-104-induced anti-tumor immunity. Together, these findings reveal purinosome assembly and purine salvage as key mechanisms of cancer cell adaptation and resilience to purine shortage while identifying microtubules, MTAP, and immunoevasion deficits as therapeutic vulnerabilities."
"The fidelity of template-dependent mRNA synthesis during transcription elongation is the primary determinant of accurate gene expression and the maintenance of functional RNA transcripts. However, the mechanisms governing transcription fidelity remain incompletely understood. While previous studies have characterized how error rates vary with nucleotide identity at upstream and downstream positions from the incorporation site, the comprehensive microscopic explanation of this sequence dependence has not been elucidated. In this study, we develop a novel theoretical approach that integrates transcription proofreading mechanisms and inhomogenous DNA sequence effects. Using first-passage analysis validated by Monte Carlo simulations, we quantitatively characterize nucleotide-specific error rates during RNA polymerase II transcription. The model accurately reproduces experimental error rates and predicts kinetic parameters influencing transcriptional fidelity. Analysis reveals nucleotide incorporation rates follow the hierarchy U<C<G<A, consistent with independent experimental observations. Notably, our model not only explains how the error rates depend on the nature of the base immediately down-stream (+1) but also predicts that the identity of the nucleotide at the second downstream position (+2) also plays an important role. Pyrimidines at position +2 contribute to lower error rates than purines, whereas the third downstream base (+3) has no effect. These previously unreported correlations are corroborated by bioinformatic analysis of existing datasets. In addition, using the BRCA1 gene as an example, we explore the physiological implications of sequence-dependent error rates, identifying an increased likelihood of premature stop codon errors. These findings clarify how DNA sequence context modulates nucleotide incorporation kinetics, advancing our understanding of transcriptional fidelity and its functional consequences."
"Microsporidia have long been proposed as biological agents for controlling disease vectors and the parasites they transmit. However, their study in vector biology has been constrained due to challenges in manipulating microsporidia within hosts. In this study, we investigated the effect of Dexrazoxane, a candidate drug against microsporidiosis, on the establishment and development of Vavraia culicis infection in its natural host, the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, the main malaria vector. Our findings show that Dexrazoxane significantly reduces spore load, particularly in mosquitoes reared individually, without affecting the overall infection success of the parasite. This result aligns with studies in Caenorhabditis elegans, where Dexrazoxane inhibited new spore production without hindering initial spore integration into the host gut cells. Dexrazoxanes DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor mechanism likely explains its impact on mosquito development, as larvae exposed to the drug failed to emerge as adults. These findings highlight Dexrazoxanes potential as a viable tool for controlling microsporidia in adult mosquitoes and hope to enhance the study of mosquito-microsporidia interactions. Further research is required to explore its broader application in vector-borne disease control, including malaria."
"Indian cattle breeds (Bos indicus) are renowned for their resilience in diverse environments and resistance to infections compared to Bos taurus. Although recent studies have explored the genetic basis of disease resistance in cattle, comprehensive analyses aimed at identifying the genomic signatures associated with disease-resistance traits in Indian cattle are still unclear. A genome-wide comparison between Bos indicus and Bos taurus could uncover key genomic elements related to disease-resistance traits or immunity. This study aimed to conduct chromosome-by-chromosome analyses among Bos genomes using three pairwise combinations: Bos taurus (Hereford) vs. Bos indicus (Nelore breed), Bos taurus (Hereford) vs. Bos indicus (Gir), and Bos indicus (Nelore) vs. Bos indicus (Gir) to investigate genomic variations focusing in immunity genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Comparative genomic analysis was performed using SyMAP, GSAlign, and SyRI. An in-house Python script was utilized for gene annotation and visualization. Statistical differences in genomic variations among breed pairs were assessed using ANOVA. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis were carried out using DAVID for each variant type. The analysis revealed non-syntenic regions associated with four immunity genes in Nelore: VSTM1L, Galectin-9, HDAC5, and POLH. Significant genomic differences were observed on chromosomes 12, 24, 28, 29 and X. Chromosome X of the Nelore lost 50 Mbps of genomic regions compared to Hereford, although all genes remained intact. Further exploration of translocation events on Chromosome X in the Nelore revealed that chromosomes 28 had more single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions, and deletions. In total, 8, 16, and 209 innate immunity genes in Nelore were observed with longer insertions, deletions, and substitutions respectively with 62 genes were had all three variations with statistical significance. QTL analysis indicated these variations were primarily linked to milk and health traits. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that genes with substitution variants were significantly enriched in immune-related processes, including NF-kappa B signaling, cytokine production, and T cell receptor signaling. Several key immune genes, such as TLR4, TLR9, RIPK2, PLCG2, FADD, CLEC7A, RELA, CD40, TRIM25, IRAK1/2/3, NOD2, BCL2, and CARD9, were involved in multiple biological process, highlighting the impact of structural variations on immune function in Nelore cattle. Overall, this study highlights genomic variations in innate immunity genes in Nelore, its associated QTLs, biological process and pathways. This finding lays the groundwork for future research to identify the immune markers related to disease-resistance traits in indicine cattle."
"Follicle Stem Cells (FSCs) in the germarium of a Drosophila melanogaster ovary are maintained through independent regulation of division and differentiation. Adult FSCs can become proliferative Follicle Cells (FCs) to the posterior, or quiescent Escort Cells (ECs) to the anterior. Graded extracellular Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt signals emanate from cells anterior to FSCs (Cap Cells and ECs) to guide these behaviors together with an inverse JAK-STAT pathway stimulated by ligand from a more posterior source (polar FCs). Here we used lineage analyses to investigate the role of those signals in the development of ECs, FSCs and FCs from a common set of precursors during pupation. Previous studies found that the most anterior precursors divide slowest, with quiescence spreading to all future ECs from the anterior, FSCs are specified simply by their location at eclosion, and the first FCs derive from a group of cells that accumulates posterior to the developing germline over the first 48h of pupation. We now show that the latter cells derive from migration of precursors out of the developing germarium. We also found that Wnt pathway activity favored conversion of precursors to more anterior adult derivatives, while JAK-STAT pathway activity favored posterior outcomes. Wnt pathway activity increased over the first 48h and maintained a graded pattern throughout pupation, terminating at the anterior extent of FC specification, commensurate with Wnt pathway activity continuously opposing FC formation. JAK-STAT pathway activity was consistently lowest in anterior cells, indicating a posterior source early in pupation prior to formation of the first polar FCs. Precursor division was promoted by JAK-STAT signaling and also by Hh signaling, acting through transcriptional induction of yorkie. Faster division favored a precursor becoming an FSC, as seen for FSC lineage maintenance in adults.

Article SummaryDrosophila ovarian Follicle Stem Cell (FSC) behavior and regulation by graded Hedgehog (Hh), Wnt and JAK-STAT signals is well understood, motivating us to study mechanisms guiding development of FSCs and the neighboring cell types they maintain. The marked progeny of single cells labeled at pupariation were compared in adults for lineages with genetic alterations affecting signal transduction. Wnt and JAK-STAT had strong opposing influences on the anterior-posterior location, and hence identity of derivatives, while JAK-STAT and Hh (via Yorkie) stimulated cell division, similar to responses in adult FSCs. Conversion of precursors to FSCs, like FSC maintenance, was favored by higher division rates."
"Understanding strategies of organisms that utilise multiple modes of reproduction presents a complex challenge for evolutionary biologists. Platygyra daedalea, a common reef-building coral with unclear reproductive boundaries between morphological species, illustrates these complexities. Here, we evaluate the contribution of these reproductive modes in the coral P. daedalea at Heron Island, on the southern Great Barrier Reef. We tagged and sequenced eighteen coral colonies, representing various degrees of spatial clustering, along a 130-m stretch of shallow reef slope. During spawning, divers collected eggs from each colony and placed them in mesh containers within the spawn slick, allowing free movement of sperm for fertilisation. High levels of spawning asynchrony were observed, potentially indicating distinct genetic clusters within the putative species, which resulted in low fertilisation success (1.5%). Notably, of those fertilised eggs, paternity assignments revealed that all resulting embryos were self-fertilised, with no cross-fertilisation occurring. The adult population showed evidence of two genetically distinct subpopulations, along with levels of spatial autocorrelation and inbreeding. This evidence supports the notion of small breeding populations within larger assemblages, density-dependent population effects, and localised recruitment. Selfing may serve as a reproductive assurance mechanism in such populations, which may be more hierarchically structured than previously thought. Given the lack of evidence for in situ outcrossed fertilisation in this natural coral population during split spawning, it appears that P. daedalea may rely on limited high-density patches of adults for successful cross-fertilisation, utilise atypical modes of reproduction when at low densities, and/or sustain its population through limited progeny."
"High population density should drive individuals to more frequently share space and interact, producing better-connected spatial and social networks [1-4]. Although this theory is fundamental to our understanding of disease dynamics [2,5-8], it remains unconfirmed how local density generally drives individuals positions within their networks, which reduces our ability to understand and predict density-dependent processes [4,9,10]. Here we provide the first general evidence that density drives greater network connectedness at fine spatiotemporal scales, at the scale of individuals within wild animal populations. We analysed 36 datasets of simultaneous spatial and social behaviour in >58,000 individual animals, spanning 30 species of fish, reptiles, birds, mammals, and insects. 80% of systems exhibited strong positive relationships between local density and network centrality. However, >80% of relationships were nonlinear and 75% became shallower at higher values, signifying that demographic and behavioural processes counteract densitys effects, thereby producing saturating trends [11-15]. Densitys effect was much stronger and less saturating for spatial than social networks, such that individuals become disproportionately spatially connected rather than socially at higher densities. Consequently, ecological processes that depend on spatial connections (e.g. indirect pathogen transmission, resource competition, and territory formation) are likely more density-dependent than those involving social interactions (e.g. direct pathogen transmission, aggression, and social learning). These findings reveal fundamental ecological rules governing societal structuring, with widespread implications. Identifying scaling rules based on processes that generalise across systems, such as these patterns of density dependence, might provide the ability to predict network structures in novel systems."
"Zancudomyces culisetae is an obligate symbiotic fungus inhabiting the digestive tracts of aquatic insect larvae, including black flies, midges, and mosquitoes. With a global distribution and high prevalence in disease-transmitting insects, Z. culisetae serves as a model for studying insect gut fungi. A previous draft genome assembly using Illumina short reads provided insights into its genome composition, such as a low GC ratio and evidence of horizontal gene transfer. However, its fragmented nature has limited deeper exploration of the evolutionary mechanisms shaping these gut symbionts. To address this gap, we generated a wealth of genomic resources for Z. culisetae using multiple sequencing platforms, including Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, PacBio-CLR (Complete Long Reads), and PacBio-HiFi (High Fidelity). This also provides an opportunity to compare these popular sequencing methods to suggest the optimal approach for fungal genome assembly. Our results suggest that PacBio-HiFi produced the most complete assembly, yielding a 27.8 Mb genome size with 26 contigs, representing the highest-quality genome of insect gut fungi to date. Additionally, we generated transcriptomic data to support genome annotation, identifying 8,484 protein-coding genes. Despite the improved genome quality, Z. culisetae lacks approximately 20% of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologue (BUSCO) commonly found in fungi, reflecting adaptations to its obligate symbiotic lifestyle. This study not only provides valuable genomic resources for insect gut fungal research but also evaluates the strengths and limitations of current genome sequencing and assembly approaches, offering best practices for fungal genome analysis and genetic research.

Article SummaryMosquito larvae harbor gut-dwelling fungi that may influence their development and disease transmission. Zancudomyces culisetae is a widespread fungal symbiont of mosquitoes, but its genome remained incomplete. This study explored and compared popular sequencing technologies, including Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, PacBio-CLR, and PacBio-HiFi, to generate a high-quality genome, alongside the first transcriptomic data. PacBio-HiFi produced the most complete assembly (27.8 Mb, 26 contigs) with 8,484 protein-coding genes, though [~]20% of core fungal genes were absent, reflecting symbiotic adaptation. This study establishes a genomic foundation for insect gut-dwelling fungi and evaluates available sequencing and assembly strategies for high-quality fungal genome production."
"A long-standing debate in neuropsychology concerns whether perception and memory function as independent systems or interact to support cognition. To investigate this, we developed the Face Memory and Perception (FMP) task, a novel paradigm designed to systematically disentangle whether and how these processes interact under different conditions. Across four independent datasets with over 800 participants in total, we observed consistent evidence that face perception and working memory operate independently when task demands are low, but in more complex conditions, these processes appear to interact. Notably, this interaction emerged only when the interference directly involved face-processing mechanisms, and did not arise from a general increase in cognitive load. Rather than the use of shared resources by overlapping cognitive processes, this interaction was driven by a shift in behavioural strategy from holistic to feature-based face processing as a result of maintenance-disrupting interference. These results underscore the fundamental independence of perception and working memory while also explaining some of the conditions under which interactions might be observed."
"Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for >150,000 deaths every year with a mortality rate as high as 81%. This high medical burden is due, in part, to an incomplete understanding of its pathogenesis. In a previous study, we identified a cryptococcal atypical ATP-binding cassette (ABC) pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) transporter, PDR6, that affected antifungal resistance and host interactions. Here, we follow-up on the role of PDR6 in cryptococcal virulence. In vivo, mice infected with the pdr6{Delta} strain display altered symptomatology and disease progression. Specifically, we observed a significant increase in the innate immune cell populations in the pdr6{Delta}-infected mice when compared to their WT-infected littermates. Furthermore, quantification of pulmonary cytokines/chemokines revealed a robust increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice infected with the pdr6{Delta} mutant strain. Despite the documented sensitivity of the pdr6{Delta} strain to azole antifungal drugs, the treatment of pdr6{Delta}-infected animals with antifungals did not affect survival, yet treatment with a corticosteroid significantly extended survival, highlighting the importance of a balanced/controlled host immune response. Results with mice that mount opposing immune responses supports out hypothesis that the pdr6{Delta} strain induces a hyper-inflammatory immune response, and that the mice succumb to immune-dependent tissue damage rather than the fungal burden. This altered immune response is driven, in part, by changes in the mutants surface. Taken together, this study provides insights regarding cryptococcal pathogenesis and highlights additional functions of PDR-type ABC transporters in pathogenic fungi.

IMPORTANCEYeasts of the Cryptococcus genus, especially C. neoformans, can cause disease with unacceptably high mortality. This is due to delays in diagnostics, ineffective treatments, and an incomplete understanding of the interactions between this fungus and our immune system. In this study, we expand our knowledge of the biological function of the PDR6 gene, particularly its effect on modulating the hosts immune response. Normally, C. neoformanss infections are characterized by an anti-inflammatory response that is unable to control the yeast. In the absence of PDR6, the response to the infection is a dysregulated pro-inflammatory response that initially controls the fungi but eventually results in death of the host due to too much tissue damage. This is due, in part, to an altered fungal surface. Given the dual role of PDR6 in modulating antifungal sensitivity and immune responses, this work provides important insights that may lead to new or improved therapeutics."
"Cell shape deformation in eukaryotes, is primarily determined by the actin cortex, a thin network of actin filaments and myosin motors. This network is attached to the plasma membrane endowing cells with their mechanical stability and structural integrity. Since inside the cells hundreds of proteins are associated with the actin cortex, identifying the roles of the individual components and the mechanisms maintaining a functional cortex is highly challenging. Here, using a minimal set of components, we succeeded in recreating long-lasting dynamic treadmilling in an artificial actomyosin cortex on a bilayer membrane with cell-mimicking characteristics, both with and without myosin-II motors, replicating features observed in cells, such as myosin-induced increased cortical thickness and stress-dependent dynamics. We mechanistically reveal how treadmilling is regulated by actin network disassembly factors and myosin contractility, and the emergence of robustness of the cortical thickness to concentration fluctuations in cytoskeletal components. The robustness and responsiveness of the actin cortex which we found has a fundamental significance for the ability of Eukaryotic cells to maintain the mechanical integrity of their membrane, despite concentration fluctuation of the cytoskeleton components. Unlike complex biological cells, this system enables high-resolution and systematic studies of cortical dynamics under controlled conditions. It thus provides a cell-mimicking artificial system for designing interventions to modify the cellular cortex to improve our understanding of the basic mechanisms driving fundamental biological processes as well as for potential medical applications.

SignificanceWe report a breakthrough in understanding the actin cortex, a key structure governing cell shape, stability, and motility. By reconstructing in-vitro a treadmilling actomyosin cortex on a lipid bilayer using minimal components, we replicate essential cellular features. This system reveals how cortical thickness is maintained despite concentration fluctuations, highlighting an actin turnover mechanism that buffers variability. The inclusion of myosin motors is found to modify the cortical dynamics, mimicking cellular properties such as the increased thickness and stress-dependent dynamics. Unlike complex living cells, this artificial system enables systematic studies of cortical behavior, with fine control over the components and high-resolution imaging. Our artificial system provides a platform for designing interventions to modify cortical dynamics, with broad implications for biology and medicine.

One-Sentence SummaryIn-vitro recreation of a cell-like, membrane-bound cortical actin skeleton composed of a minimal set of building-blocks with continuous turnover and emergent robustness."
"ContextKnowledge of where wildlife species are and in what number is critical to support robust contingency planning for diseases affecting animal and human health. For common widespread species in particular, comprehensive surveillance is impractical and challenging to coordinate. This is where models can be useful, to fill in the gaps and direct survey efforts to maximise understanding. The ENETWILD project was commissioned by EFSA in 2017 to review available data and modelling methods to predict distributions for key species involved in diseases of concern (e.g., wild boar and African swine fever). Here, we outline the latest methodology to predict species distributions based on occurrence data and outline the areas where further data would be most helpful.

MethodWe present a generic framework to model the distribution of common mammal species in Europe, using global data. Based on occurrence records from large scale repositories, our method first attempts to address known biases to produce a presence-absence dataset and then applies random forest modelling to predict habitat suitability. We apply this approach to twelve species spanning distinct survey methodologies within mammal recording (visual observation, trapping, and bats/audio monitoring).

ResultsModel performance was acceptable across all species within the limits of the available training data (AUC close to or above 0.7). However, beyond these limits the reliability of prediction was substantially reduced. Assessment of the available data suggested large areas of Eastern and Southern (particularly mountainous) parts of Europe have a distinct environmental signature not sufficiently captured by the existing sampling.

ConclusionsWithin Europe there remain environmental conditions which are not well represented by existing surveillance, predominantly in Eastern and Southern regions. To reliably apply a robust modelling approach to a Europe-wide context targeted data collection is required."
"A key goal of vision science is to uncover the computations involved in perceiving visual properties like colour, curvature, or glossiness. Here, we used machine learning as a data-driven tool to identify potential computations of gloss perception. We generated thousands of object images using computer graphics--varying lighting, shapes, and viewpoints--and experimentally measured perceived glossiness for each image. Observers showed curious patterns of agreement and disagreement with the physical reflectance in their gloss estimates, yet their judgments remained highly consistent both within and across individuals. We then compared two sets of neural networks: one set trained to mimic the human responses ( human-like networks) and another trained on physical labels to approximate physical reality ( ground-truth networks). We progressively reduced the size of the networks to identify the minimum computations capable of meeting the two objective functions. While quite deep networks were required to estimate physical reflectance, we found that surprisingly shallow networks--with as few as three convolutional layers--could accurately replicate human gloss judgments. Indeed, even a miniscule  network with just a single filter could predict human judgments better than the best ground-truth network. The human-like networks also successfully predicted some known perceptual gloss effects beyond the training range. Our findings suggest that humans do not judge material properties through complex computations such as inverse optics; instead, gloss perception arises from simpler computations useful for other visual tasks."
"Modern bird diversity spans a striking array of forms, behaviours, and ecological roles. Analyses of molecular evolutionary rates can reveal the links between genomic and phenotypic change, but disentangling the drivers of rate variation has been difficult across large numbers of whole-genomes. Using comprehensive estimates of traits and evolutionary rates across a family-level phylogeny of birds, we show that clutch size, generation length, and beak shape are dominant predictors of genome-wide mutation rates. To identify the major axes of evolutionary rate variation, we employ covariance matrix eigendecomposition from rates estimated for branches of the avian phylogeny and across genomic loci. We find that the majority of rate variation occurs along the terminal branches of the phylogeny associated with extant families of birds. Additionally, we use principal components analyses to show that several axes of variation are linked with rapid evolution in microchromosomes immediately after the Cretaceous-Palaeogene transition. These apparent pulses of evolution are consistent with major changes in evolutionary rates in the machineries for meiosis, heart performance, and RNA splicing, surveillance, and translation. They also correlate with the diversification of ecological niches reflected in increased tarsus length. Collectively, our analyses paint a nuanced picture of avian evolutionary rates through time, revealing that the ancestors of the most diverse lineages of birds underwent major genomic changes related to mutation, gene usage, and niche expansion near the beginning of the Palaeogene period."
"Conventional genome mapping-based approaches systematically miss genetic variation, particularly in regions that substantially differ from the reference. To explore this hidden variation, we examined unmapped and poorly mapped reads from the genomes of 640 human individuals from South Asian (SAS) populations in the 1000 Genomes Project and the Simons Genome Diversity Project. We assembled tens of megabases of non-redundant sequence in tens of thousands of large contigs, much of which is present in both SAS and non-SAS populations. We demonstrated that much of this sequence is not discovered by traditional variant discovery approaches even when using complete genomes and pangenomes. Across 20,000 placed contigs, we found 8,215 intersections with 106 protein coding genes and >15,000 placements within 1 kbp of a known GWAS hit. We used long read data from a subset of samples to validate the majority of their assembled sequences, aligned RNA-seq data to identify hundreds of unplaced contigs with transcriptional potential, and queried existing nucleotide databases to evaluate the origins of the remaining unplaced sequences. Our results highlight the limitations of even the most complete reference genomes and provide a model for understanding the distribution of hidden variation in any human population."
"FO_SCPLOWLUORESCENCEC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWMICROSCOPYC_SCPLOW, a key driver for progress in the life sciences, faces limitations due to the microscopes optics, fluorophore chemistry, and photon exposure limits, necessitating trade-offs in imaging speed, resolution, and depth. Here, we introduce Micro[S]plit, a computational multiplexing technique based on deep learning that allows multiple cellular structures to be imaged in a single fluorescent channel and then unmix them by computational means, allowing faster imaging and reduced photon exposure. We show that Micro[S]plit efficiently separates up to four superimposed noisy structures into distinct denoised fluorescent image channels. Furthermore, using Variational Splitting Encoder-Decoder (VSE) networks, our approach can sample diverse predictions from a trained posterior of solutions. The diversity of these samples scales with the uncertainty in a given input, allowing us to estimate the true prediction errors by computing the variability between posterior samples. We demonstrate the robustness of Micro[S]plit across various datasets and noise levels and show its utility to image more, to image faster, and to improve downstream analysis. We provide Micro[S]plit along with all associated training and evaluation datasets as open resources, enabling life scientists to immediately benefit from the potential of computational multiplexing and thus help accelerate the rate of their scientific discovery process."
"Genome organization recapitulates function, yet ciliates like Oxytricha trifallax possess highly-specialized germline genomes, which are largely transcriptionally silent. During post-zygotic development, Oxytricha's germline undergoes large-scale genome editing, rearranging precursor genome elements into a transcriptionally-active genome with thousands of gene-sized nanochromosomes. Transgenerationally-inherited RNAs, derived from the parental somatic genome, program the retention and reordering of germline fragments. Retained and eliminated DNA must be distinguished and processed separately, but the role of chromatin organization in this process is unknown. We developed tools for studying Oxytricha nuclei and apply them to map the 3D organization of precursor and developmental states using Hi-C. We find that the precursor conformation primes the germline for development, while a massive spatial reorganization during development differentiates retained from eliminated regions before DNA rearrangement. Further experiments suggest a role for RNA-DNA interactions and chromatin remodeling in this process, implying a critical role for 3D architecture in programmed genome rearrangement."
"Feline coronavirus (FCoV), the causative agent behind feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), is one of the biggest infectious threats to feline health. Despite this threat, the tissue distribution and viral RNA levels in cats infected with feline coronaviruses are poorly understood in the context of natural infection. Here, we used quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) to examine viral RNA levels from different sampling sites in both cats that have been clinically suspected of FIP and their feline housemates. We show that the distribution and amount of FCoV viral RNA does not differ between infected FIP cats and their feline housemates in blood, conjunctiva, or feces. Furthermore, in all FIP and non-FIP cases, viral RNA levels were higher in fecal samples than the blood. Taken together these results indicate a need for closer examination of FCoVs and how they cause FIP."
"Inference of Ancestral Recombination Graphs (ARGs) is of central interest in the analysis of genomic variation. ARGs can be specified in terms of topologies and coalescence times. The coalescence times are usually estimated using an informative prior derived from coalescent theory, but this may generate biased estimates and can also complicate downstream inferences based on ARGs. Here we introduce, POLEGON, a novel approach for estimating branch lengths for ARGs which uses an uninformative prior. Using extensive simulations, we show that this method provides improved estimates of coalescence times and lead to more accurate inferences of effective population sizes under a wide range of demographic assumptions. It also improves other downstream inferences including estimates of mutation rates. We apply the method to data from the 1000 Genomes Project to investigate population size histories and differential mutation signatures across populations. We also estimate coalescence times in the HLA region, and show that they exceed 30 million years in multiple segments."
"A major goal of speciation research is identifying loci that underpin barriers to gene flow. Population genomics takes a  bottom-up approach, scanning the genome for molecular signatures of processes that drive or maintain divergence. However, interpreting the  genomic landscape of speciation is complicated, because genome scans conflate multiple processes, most of which are not informative about gene flow. However, studying replicated population contrasts, including multiple incidences of secondary contact, can strengthen inferences. In this paper, we use linked-read sequencing (haplotagging), FST scans, and genealogical methods to characterise the genomic landscape associated with replicate hybrid zone formation. We studied two flower colour varieties of the common snapdragon, Antirrhinum majus subspecies majus, that form secondary hybrid zones in multiple independent valleys in the Pyrenees. Consistent with past work, we found very low differentiation at one well-studied zone (Planoles). However, at a second zone (Avallenet), we found stronger differentiation and greater heterogeneity, which we argue is due to differences in the amount of introgression following secondary contact. Topology weighting of genealogical trees identified loci where haplotype diversity was associated with the two snapdragon varieties. Two of the strongest associations were at previously identified flower colour loci: Flavia, that affects yellow pigmentation, and Rosea/Eluta, two linked loci that affect magenta pigmentation. Preliminary analysis of coalescence times provides additional evidence for selective sweeps at these loci and barriers to gene flow. Our study highlights the impact of demographic history on the differentiation landscape, emphasizing the need to distinguish between historical divergence and recent introgression."
"In polyandrous systems, male reproductive success is critically influenced by sperm competition, a process often mediated by ejaculate characteristics that are sensitive to male condition. While condition dependence is a cornerstone of sexual selection theory, the role of the gut microbiome in modulating male reproductive fitness under sperm competition remains unexplored. Here, we investigated the impact of varying gut microbial compositions on sperm competitive ability in Drosophila melanogaster. By inoculating germ-free (axenic) males with all 32 full-factorial combinations of five common commensal bacteria, we demonstrated that the presence and diversity of the gut microbiota significantly enhance male sperm offense ability. Specifically, males associated with a more diverse microbiota exhibited superior competitive fertilization success, accompanied by increased sperm transfer, higher sperm viability, and a greater proportion of sperm stored by females. Predictive models further revealed complex, non-additive interactions among bacterial species in their effects on sperm competitiveness. These findings suggest that the gut microbiome acts as a critical modulator of male reproductive fitness, challenging traditional models of sexual selection that overlook contributions of non-pathogenic bacteria to condition-dependent traits."
"The excitability of the sensorimotor (SM1) cortices is reflected in the bilateral [~]20 Hz beta oscillations. The extent to which these oscillations subtend the interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) captured by the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) ipsilateral Silent Period (iSP) protocol remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between movement-related beta suppression and the iSP, along with their role for manual dexterity. Forty adults underwent an Electroencephalography assessment of beta suppression during volitional left hand movement and a TMS assessment of iSP recorded from the right hand. In both cases, left SM1 beta oscillations (contralateral to the activated right SM1), were monitored through a proxy signal - the Electromyography of the contracted right hand. Bimanual dexterity was assessed with the Purdue Pegboard. Volitional movement caused significant bilateral SM1 beta suppression in nearly all participants ([&ge;] 85 %). ISPs were observed in every participant. In the proxy signal for the left SM1, the iSP coincided with TMS-evoked high-amplitude beta bursts. These bursts showed significant phase alignment across participants 10-70 ms after the TMS pulse. There was no significant association between the left-/right-hemisphere beta suppression, iSP, and bimanual dexterity. Our results highlight the distinct nature of beta oscillation changes during volitional movement compared to TMS-iSP and show that TMS induces IHI via transcallosal generation of phase aligned beta bursts. Furthermore, our data suggests that only the initial phase of a beta burst carries an inhibitory effect. It also highlights the possibility of evoking a beta burst with the iSP protocol, opening perspectives for future neuroimaging and modeling studies."
"Climate change and the global spread of non-native species are two of the most significant threats to biodiversity and ecosystem function. Both these phenomena subject populations to novel conditions, either in space (species introductions) or in time (climate change), yet the role of adaptation in how populations respond to these rapid environmental shifts is poorly understood. We conducted a large-scale trans-continental common garden experiment using white clover (Trifolium repens, Fabaceae) to test whether adaptive evolution to spatiotemporal variation in climate could contribute to the ecological success of one of the most widespread plant species in the world. Individuals from 96 populations of Trifolium repens (white clover) from both its native (Europe) and introduced (North America) ranges were planted into four experimental common gardens located in northern (Uppsala, Sweden) and southern (Montpellier, France) Europe, and northern (Mississauga, Canada) and southern (Lafayette, USA) North America. We recorded plant sexual and clonal fitness in each common garden and assessed whether the strength of local adaptation differed between the native and introduced ranges and whether populations are rapidly adapting to climate change. Results show that local adaptation was only evident when populations were transplanted into common gardens located in the same range (native or introduced) from which they originated and was driven by stronger selection (due to climatic factors rather than herbivory) at lower latitudes in both ranges. Our results indicate rapid local adaptation across a large latitudinal gradient in introduced T. repens populations, along with an associated adaptation cost when transplanted back into the native range. We also find evidence of an adaptation lag in the northern common garden in the introduced range, with plants from historically warmer climates exhibiting the greatest fitness. These findings support two major conclusions: 1) white clover can rapidly adapt to spatial variation in climate in its introduced range as well as the native range, and 2) despite rapid adaptation to novel environments, introduced white clover populations are not keeping pace with rapid climate change. Overall, our results provide insight into the role of adaptation in facilitating the ecological success of non-native species in a rapidly changing world.

"Feeding and reproduction are known to be closely correlated with each other, and the seasonal breeders show breeding season-dependent feeding behavior. However, most model animals do not have definite breeding seasonality, and the mechanisms for such feeding behavior remain unclear. Here, we focused on female medaka (Oryzias latipes); they show breeding season-dependent feeding behavior, and their condition of breeding season can be experimentally controlled by day-length. We first demonstrated that, among previously reported feeding-related peptides (neuropeptides involved in feeding), agouti-related peptide 1 (agrp1) and neuropeptide y b (npyb) show higher brain expression under the breeding condition than under the non-breeding one. Combined with analysis of agrp1 knockout medaka, we obtained results to suggest that long day-induced sexually mature condition, especially ovarian estrogenic signals, increase the expressions of agrp1 in the brain, which results in increased food intake to promote reproduction. Our findings advance the understanding of neural mechanisms of feeding behavior for reproductive success."
"Biological systems exhibit remarkable heterogeneity, characterized by intricate interplay among diverse cell types. Resolving the regulatory processes of specific cell types is crucial for delineating developmental mechanisms and disease etiologies. While single-cell sequencing methods such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq have revolutionized our understanding of individual cellular functions, adapting bulk genome-wide assays to achieve single-cell resolution of other genomic features remains a significant technical challenge. Here, we introduce Deep-learning-based DEconvolution of Tissue profiles with Accurate Interpretation of Locus-specific Signals (DeepDETAILS), a novel quasi-supervised framework to reconstruct cell-type-specific genomic signals with base-pair precision. DeepDETAILS core innovation lies in its ability to perform cross-modality deconvolution using scATAC-seq reference libraries for other bulk datasets, benefiting from the affordability and availability of scATAC-seq data. DeepDETAILS enables high-resolution mapping of genomic signals across diverse cell types, with great versatility for various omics datasets, including nascent transcript sequencing (such as PRO-cap and PRO-seq) and ChIP-seq for chromatin modifications. Our results demonstrate that DeepDETAILS significantly outperformed traditional statistical deconvolution methods. Using DeepDETAILS, we developed a comprehensive compendium of high-resolution nascent transcription and histone modification signals across 39 diverse human tissues and 86 distinct cell types. Furthermore, we applied our compendium to fine-map risk variants associated with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a progressive cholestatic liver disorder, and revealed a potential etiology of the disease. Our tool and compendium provide invaluable insights into cellular complexity, opening new avenues for studying biological processes in various contexts."
"In all eukaryotes, the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, a multilayered interconnected network of enzymes, connects external stimuli to gene regulation, dictating cellular fate. However, mechanisms for encoding information in this complex, fluctuating network to activate specific responses remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the central human stress regulator protein p38 MAPK encodes information regarding experienced stresses as different frequency oscillations of its activation state. These oscillations are used to drive specific responses through frequency-dependent resonance of oscillating biochemical phosphorylation reactions between p38 and downstream targets. These interactions closely mirror those of electronic alternating current (AC) circuits and their components, providing a unique framework through which to understand signal transduction in the MAPK cascade. Finally, we demonstrate how this understanding of bioresonance allows us to induce specific genetic responses simply by exposing cells to sugar to force activation state oscillations of p38 at predetermined frequencies."
"Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) remain a critical intervention in controlling malaria transmission, yet the behavioural adaptations of mosquitoes in response to these interventions are not fully understood. This study examined the flight behaviour of insecticide-resistant (IR) and insecticide-susceptible (IS) Anopheles gambiae strains around an Olyset net (OL), a permethrin-impregnated ITN, versus an untreated net (UT). Using machine learning (ML) models, we classified mosquito flight trajectories with high accuracy (0.838) and ROC AUC (0.925). Contrary to assumptions that behavioural changes at OL would intensify over time, our findings show an immediate onset of convoluted, erratic flight paths for both IR and IS mosquitoes around the treated net. SHAP analysis identified three key predictive features of OL exposure: frequency of zero-crossings in flight angle change, first quartile of flight angle change, and zero-crossings in horizontal velocity. These suggest disruptive flight patterns, indicating insecticidal irritancy. While IS mosquitoes displayed rapid, disordered trajectories and mostly died within 30 minutes, IR mosquitoes persisted throughout the 2-hour experiments but exhibited similarly disturbed behaviour, suggesting resistance does not fully mitigate disruption. Our findings challenge literature suggesting permethrins repellency in solution form, instead supporting an irritant or contactdriven effect when incorporated into net fibres. This study highlights the value of ML-based trajectory analysis for understanding mosquito behaviour, refining ITN configurations and evaluating novel active ingredients aimed at disrupting mosquito flight behaviour. Future work should extend these methods to other ITNs to further illuminate the complex interplay between mosquito behaviour and insecticidal intervention."
"The N400 component of ERPs is modulated by how predictable a word is, but predictability is usually quantified with lexical cloze--the probability that readers supply that exact word in offline sentence completion tasks. This form-based metric is at odds with decades of evidence that the N400 is primarily sensitive to meaning. Here, we asked whether a measure of semantic feature predictability can better account for N400 amplitude modulation. We reanalysed two independent EEG datasets (N = 26 and N = 334), computing lexical and semantic cloze for each critical word. Across the two datasets, semantic cloze explained significantly more N400 variance than lexical cloze. Using the same materials, we then compared semantic and lexical cloze with probabilities from four large language models (GPT-2, GPT-2.7b, RoBERTa, ALBERT). None of the LLM-derived predictors outperformed semantic cloze. Our findings support the view that the N400 primarily reflects semantic--not exact-word--processing. Methodologically, we argue that replacing lexical cloze with semantic cloze can substantially increase the explanatory power of N400 studies, and caution against substituting human norms with raw LLM probabilities."
"Chain elongating bacteria (CEB) are a unique guild of anaerobes that convert lactate, ethanol, and acetate derived from organic waste into valuable short- and medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). However, the metabolic rules that determine product chain length have remained elusive. Here, we combine 13C isotope tracing, proteomics, and metabolic modelling to show that distinct acetate utilization strategies underlie the divergence between butyrate- and MCFA-producing CEB. MCFA-producing strains sustain redox balance while recycling acetate to maximize lactate use under acetate limitation, but at the cost of slower growth due to increased protein burden. In contrast, butyrate-producing strains grow faster due to lower protein costs by favoring acetate assimilation, at the cost of restricted lactate utilization when acetate is scarce. These physiological trade-offs are encoded in the substrate specificity of coenzyme A transferase, the terminal enzyme in reverse {beta}-oxidation. Our findings uncover a fundamental constraint shaping chain-length selectivity in CEB and offer new strategies to optimize MCFA production from organic waste streams."
"Sensory input and internal context converge onto the hippocampus as spatio-temporal activity patterns. Transitions in these input patterns are frequently salient. We demonstrate that short-term potentiation (STP) mediates escape from EI balance to implement mismatch detection in spatiotemporally patterned activity sequences. We characterized STP in the mouse hippocampus CA3-CA1 network using optogenetic patterned stimuli in CA3 while recording from CA1 pyramidal neurons. STP modulates EI summation across patterns, first amplifying, then reducing responses. We parameterized a multiscale model of network projections onto hundreds of E and I boutons on a CA1 neuron, each including stochastic signaling to mediate STP. The model detected mismatches in trains of input patterns, which we experimentally confirmed. Mismatch selectivity depends on pattern sparsity, network weights, and connectivity, and neuronal spiking makes it sharper. Finally, we predict strong mismatch detection for gamma-frequency bursts between theta cycles, consistent with theta-tuned snapshots of novel input."
"Multidrug efflux pumps are dynamic molecular machines that drive antibiotic resistance by harnessing ion gradients to export chemically diverse substrates. Despite their clinical importance, the molecular principles underlying multidrug promiscuity and energy efficiency remain poorly understood. Using multiparametric deep mutational scanning across eight substrates and two energy conditions, we deconvolute the contributions of substrate recognition, energetic coupling, and protein stability, providing an integrated, high-resolution view of multidrug transport. We find that substrate specificity arises from a distributed network of residues extending beyond the binding site, with mutations that reshape binding, coupling, conformational flexibility, and membrane interactions. Further, we apply a pH-based selection scheme to measure the effect of mutation on pH-dependent transport efficiency. By integrating these data, we reveal a fundamental relationship between efficiency and promiscuity: highly efficient variants exhibit broad substrate profiles, while inefficient variants are narrower. These findings establish a direct link between energy coupling and polyspecificity, uncovering the biochemical logic underlying multidrug transport."
"Stimuli-responsive nanomaterials with multivalent ligands have attracted significant attention in the context of cancer chemotherapy and imaging. However, challenges remain such as non-selective stimuli response and/or existence of triggers in healthy regions in addition to the intrinsic heterogeneity of cancer that causes insufficient target recognition. In-spired by the expression of precise and diverse functions of biological machineries triggered by specific protein-protein complexation and conformational change, we report an artificial system where a bioorthogonal click reaction between hetero-nano-assemblies triggers their complexation and conformational changes, resulting in emergence of multivalent ligands for cancer-associated enzymes: carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX). We also demonstrated that the multivalent ligands selectively inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells overexpressing CAIX under hypoxic conditions. Additionally, the click reaction between nano-assemblies in the presence of target cells provided a higher efficacy of the emerged multivalent ligands than that pre-formed in the absence of cells. Our study provides a basis for the development of multivalent ligands displaying adaptive binding interfaces for target cancer cells with high selectivity and affinity to thus potentially overcome tumor heterogeneity."
"Previous research has demonstrated that applying taxonomic weights to shotgun metagenomic data can improve species identification in 16S rRNA gene-based microbiome analysis. However, such an approach does not allow for accurate analysis of samples collected from less studied habitats, such as rumen. In the present study, we developed a method to incorporate taxonomic weights based on relative abundance of species identified from shotgun sequencing and amplicon sequencing data derived from rumen. Using this weighting method, we evaluated latest versions of five prominent databases--SILVA, Greengenes2, RDP, NCBI RefSeq, and GTDB--against the BLAST 16S rRNA database, assessing classification counts, fully classified ratios (proportion of ASVs classified to a known genus and species), and error rates. Our results revealed that the use of the weighting method significantly improved both classification counts and fully classified ratios, along with a substantial (P < 0.05) reduction in error rates compared to unweighted taxonomy classifier. While GG2 and SILVA struggled with accurate classification at the species level owing to their inherent database characteristics, GTDB consistently improved all metrics using the manually weighted taxonomy classifier, achieving up to an 8% error rate reduction at the species level. NCBI RefSeq and RDP also exhibited remarkable improvement in the classification counts and fully classified ratios, along with substantial error rate reductions by up to 47% at the species level. These findings demonstrate that amplicon sequencing datasets can enhance rumen microbiome analyses through effective weighting methods. While SILVA is commonly used in metataxonomic analyses of the rumen microbiome, we recommend NCBI RefSeq for species-level classification due to its superior accuracy and minimal ambiguous classification (e.g., ""uncultured"" or ""sp."") in future metataxonomic studies."
"Lipid droplets (LDs) are neutral lipid storage organelles that emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Their assembly occurs in ER regions enriched with seipin which, through its homooligomeric ring-like structure, facilitates neutral lipid nucleation. In yeast, seipin (Sei1) partners with Ldb16, Ldo45 (yeast homologue of human LDAF1) and Ldo16, which regulate LD formation and consumption. How the molecular architecture of the yeast seipin complex and its interaction with regulatory proteins adapt to different metabolic conditions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that multiple Ldb16 regions contribute differently to recruiting Ldo45 and Ldo16 to the seipin complex. Using an in-vivo site-specific photo-crosslinking approach, we further show that Ldo45 resides at the center of the seipin ring both in the absence and presence of neutral lipids. Interestingly, neutral lipid synthesis leads to the recruitment of Ldo45 but not Ldo16 to the complex. Our findings suggest that the seipin complex serves as a pre-assembled scaffold for lipid storage that can be remodeled in response to increased neutral lipid availability."
"To identify genes that regulate the response to the potentially addictive drug cocaine, we performed a control experiment using genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and RNA-Seq of a panel of inbred and recombinant inbred mice undergoing intravenous self-administration of saline. A linear mixed model increased statistical power for analysis of the longitudinal behavioral data, which was acquired over 10 days. A total of 145 loci were identified for saline compared to 17 for the corresponding cocaine GWAS. Only one locus overlapped. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) using RNA-Seq data from the nucleus accumbens and medial frontal cortex identified 5031434O11Rik and Zfp60 as significant for saline self-administration. Two other genes, Myh4 and Npc1, were nominated based on proximity to loci for multiple endpoints or a cis locus regulating expression. All four genes have previously been implicated in locomotor activity, despite the absence of a strong relationship between saline taking and distance traveled in the open field. Our results indicate a distinct genetic basis for saline and cocaine self-administration, and suggest some common genes for saline self-administration and locomotor activity."
"The medial thalamus is crucial for the sensory and affective-motivational responses to chronic pain. However, a mechanistic understanding of how the distinct subnuclei of the medial thalamus mediate behavioral responses to pain remains lacking. Taking advantage of intersectional viral genetics, chemogenetics, optogenetics, in-vivo imaging, and ex-vivo physiology, we reveal that the neurons in the parafascicular (PF) nuclei of the medial thalamus receive monosynaptic inputs from the lateral parabrachial nuclei (LPBN) in mice. LPBN is an essential nucleus in the ascending pain pathway, receiving projections from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The PF neurons downstream of LPBN (PFpost-LPBN) are nociceptive, sensitized by peripheral neuropathy, acutely aversive, and, when activated, drive both sensory and affective-motivational responses to cold pain. In contrast, the LPBN target neurons in the intralaminar centromedian thalamus (CMpost-LPBN), another nociceptive nucleus of the medial thalamus, are primarily involved in the affective-motivational aspects of pain. Together, we reveal that the LPBN, through two closely related thalamic nuclei, influences behavior in mice with cold hypersensitivity due to peripheral neuropathies."
"Membrane contact sites between organelles are important for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis. Members of the recently identified family of bridge-like lipid transfer proteins (BLTPs) span opposing membranes at these contact sites to enable the rapid transfer of bulk lipids between organelles. While the VPS13 and ATG2 family members use organelle-specific adaptors for membrane targeting, the mechanisms that regulate other bridge-like transporters remain unknown. Here, we identify the conserved protein Ybl086c, which we name Hoi1 (Hob interactor 1), as an adaptor that targets the yeast BLTP2-like proteins Fmp27/Hob1 and Hob2 to ER-PM contact sites. Two separate Hoi1 domains interface with alpha-helical projections that decorate the central hydrophobic channel on Fmp27, and loss of these interactions disrupts cellular sterol homeostasis. The mutant phenotypes of BLTP2 and HOI1 orthologs indicate these proteins act in a shared pathway in worms and flies. Together, this suggests that Hoi1-mediated recruitment of BLTP2-like proteins represents an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for regulating lipid transport at membrane contact sites."
"RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play essential roles in all major steps of RNA processing. Genetic studies in human and mouse models support that many RBPs are crucial for maintaining homeostasis in key tissues/organs, but to what extent the function of RBPs is conserved between humans and mice is not clear. Our recent study using a chimeric humanized liver mouse model found that knocking down human HuR in human hepatocytes resulted in a broad upregulation of human genes involved in fatty acid catabolism. This regulation is human-specific, as the knocking down of mouse HuR in the liver of traditional mouse models did not show these effects. To further study this human-specific role of HuR, we co-overexpressed HuR with PPAR, a master transcription factor that promotes fatty acid catabolism, in cultured cells. We found that HuR suppressed the expression of PPAR induced fatty acid catabolism genes in human cells but not in mouse cells. We provide evidence supporting that the human-specific suppressive effect of HuR is independent of PPAR expression or location. The regulatory effects of HuR are also independent of its role in regulating mRNA stability. Using the human HMGCS2 gene as an example, we found that the suppressive effect of HuR cannot be explained by decreased promoter activity. We further provide evidence supporting that HuR suppresses the pre-mRNA processing of HMGCS2 gene, leading to accumulated intron/pre-mRNA expression of HMGCS2 gene. Furthermore, overexpression of HuR blocked and knocking down of HuR sensitized PPAR agonist-induced gene expression. By analyzing published RNA-seq data, we found compromised pre-mRNA processing for fatty acid catabolism genes in patients with fatty liver diseases, which was not observed in mouse fatty liver disease models. Our study supports the model that HuR suppresses the expression of fatty acid catabolism genes by blocking their pre-mRNA processing, which may partially explain the mild effects of PPAR agonists in treating fatty liver diseases in humans as compared with studies in mice."
"During their vectorial biosynthesis on the ribosome, elongating nascent polypeptide chains explore a range of conformational states towards their biologically functional structure. However, this high structural heterogeneity has limited their observation at high-resolution. Here, we have used an integrated structural biology approach to explore the structures of the multi-domain immunoglobulin-like FLN5-6 during its biosynthesis, capturing early folding through to native folding. We developed an in-silico purification approach for cryo-EM of ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs), and integrated the resulting cryo-EM maps with NMR spectroscopy and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to produce experimentally reweighted structural ensembles of RNC. The resulting atomistic structures reveal insights into the orientational heterogeneity of the nascent chain and its dynamic interactions with the ribosome. In particular, we find that two distinct pathways exist for nascent polypeptides in the exit tunnel vestibule, influenced by their stage of biosynthesis, folding conformational state and ribosomal RNA helices lining the tunnel. Our systematic analysis of the structures of nascent proteins translation-stalled at multiple time-points provides insights into how the ribosome dynamically modulates its pathway out of the exit tunnel to regulate its folding and accessibility for auxiliary factors of other co-translational events."
"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides unprecedented insights into gene expression patterns while retaining spatial context, making it a valuable tool for understanding complex tissue architectures, such as those found in cancers. Seurat, by far the most popular tool for analyzing ST data, uses the Wilcoxon rank-sum test by default for differential expression analysis. However, as a nonparametric method that disregards spatial correlations, the Wilcoxon test can lead to inflated false positive rates and misleading findings. This limitation highlights the need for a more robust statistical approach that effectively incorporates spatial correlations. To this end, we propose a Generalized Score Test (GST) in the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) framework as a robust solution for differential gene expression analysis in ST. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of the GST with existing methods, including the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the GEEs with the robust Wald test. By appropriately accounting for spatial correlations, extensive simulations showed that the GST demonstrated superior Type I error control and comparable power relative to other methods. Applications to ST datasets from breast and prostate cancer showed that the GST-identified differentially expressed genes were enriched in pathways directly implicated in cancer progression. In contrast, the Wilcoxon test- identified genes were enriched in non-cancer pathways and produced substantial false positives, highlighting its limitations for spatially structured data. Our findings suggest that the GST approach is well-suited for ST data, offering more accurate identification of biologically relevant gene expression changes. We have implemented the proposed method in R package ""SpatialGEE"", available on GitHub.

"MotivationGenomic studies very often rely on computational intensive analyses of relationships between features, which are typically represented as intervals along one-dimensional coordinate system (such as positions on a chromosome). In this context, Python programming language is extensively used for manipulation and analysis of data stored in a tabular-form of rows and columns called dataframe. Pandas is the most-widely used Python dataframe package and is criticized for its inefficiencies and scalability problems that its novel alternative - Polars - tries to address with a vectorized backend written in Rust programming language.

Resultspolars-bio is a Python library that enables fast, parallel and out-of-core operations on large genomic intervals datasets. Its main components are implemented in Rust, using the Apache DataFusion query engine and Apache Arrow for efficient data representation. It is compatible with Polars and Pandas DataFrame formats. Single-thread benchmarking results confirm that for operations such as count overlaps is 38x and coverage is 15x faster than the state-of-the-art bioframe library. Our implementation of overlap operation consumes 90x less memory in streaming mode. Multi-thread benchmarks show good scalability and up to 282x speedup for count overlaps operation when executed with 8 CPU cores. To the best of our knowledge, polars-bio is the fastest single-node library for genomic interval dataframes in Python.

"Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an early indicator of hematologic malignancies, driven by mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) such as TET2 or TP53. Mutations in ZBTB33 have been implicated in MDS and suggested as a potential driver of CH. However, the role of ZBTB33 in hematopoiesis and its involvement in CH remains unclear. We generated a Zbtb33-knockout mouse strain to elucidate its role in hematopoiesis and the immune system. Our findings indicate that hematopoiesis in Zbtb33-defecient mice appeared grossly normal, and competitive bone marrow transplantation assays demonstrated that loss of Zbtb33 in HSCs did not confer expansional advantage. Introducing the Zbtb33 mutation into Tet2- or Tp53-mutation background yielded no synergistical effects. Tumor challenging assays suggested that Zbtb33 influences cancer immunity response, rather than directly driving CH or myeloid malignancies. In summary, ZBTB33 deficiency was insufficient to induce clonal hematopoiesis but may have a regulatory role in tumor microenvironment.

Statement of significanceClonal hematopoiesis (CH) is linked to mutations in hematopoietic stem cells, but the role of Zbtb33 in CH remains unclear. To investigate this, we examined the function of Zbtb33 under physiological conditions and in response to external stimuli. Additionally, we explored whether Zbtb33 mutations cooperate with other genetic mutations to drive clonal hematopoiesis.

Key pointsO_LILoss of Zbtb33 fails to induce clonal hematopoiesis and does not synergize with Tet or Tp53 mutations.
C_LIO_LIHowever, it plays a significant role in regulating cancer immunity and the tumor microenvironment.

"Schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) is linked to impaired self-other distinction and action feedback monitoring, largely stemming from sensory-motor predictive mechanisms. However, the neural correlates of these predictive processes during movement preparation are unknown. Here, we investigated whether patients with SSD exhibit aberrant sensory-motor predictive processes reflected in neural activation patterns prior to hand movement onset. Functional MRI data from patients with SSD (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 20) were acquired during actively performed or passively induced hand movements. The task required participants to detect temporal delays between their movements and video feedback, which either displayed their own (self) or someone elses (other) hand moving in accordance with their own hand movements.

Patients compared to healthy controls showed reduced preparatory blood-oxygen-level-dependent activation (active > passive) in clusters comprising the left putamen, left insula, left thalamus, and lobule VIII of the right cerebellum. Reduced activation in the left insula and putamen was specific to own-hand feedback. Additionally, patients with SSD revealed reduced suppression (passive > active) in bilateral and medial parietal (including the right angular gyrus) and occipital areas, the right postcentral gyrus, cerebellum crus I, as well as the left medial superior frontal gyrus. Ego-disturbances were negatively correlated with left insula and putamen activation during active conditions, and with right angular gyrus activation patterns during passive conditions when own-hand feedback was presented.

These fMRI findings suggest that group differences are primarily evident during preparatory processes. Our results show that this preparatory neural activation is further linked to symptom severity, supporting the idea that the preparation of upcoming events as internal predictive mechanisms may underlie severe symptoms in patients with SSD. These findings could improve our understanding of other deficits in action planning, self-monitoring, and motor dysfunction in various psychiatric, neurological, and neurodegenerative disorders."
"Intrinsically disordered protein regions facilitate cellular organization through phase separation into biomolecular condensates. However, the molecular interactions driving this process remain poorly understood because of experimental limitations. Here, we advance experimental throughput by several orders of magnitude by developing Condensate Partitioning by mRNA-Display (CPmD). The method allows analysis of partitioning of hundred thousand peptides derived from the disordered proteome into reconstituted condensates. Our results demonstrate that the amino acid content, rather than specific sequence, primarily determines partitioning behavior. Importantly, quantification of the partitioning energies of peptides allows us to decipher the  molecular grammar of the relevant interactions, allowing accurate prediction of the formation of condensates of diverse full-length disordered protein regions. The results reveal how physicochemical properties of disordered regions encode biological functions through formation of biomolecular condensates."
"For patients with end-stage liver failure, liver transplantation (LT) remains the standard-of-care, though five-year allograft survival rates remain below 80%. Liver ischemia reperfusion injuries (LIRI) arise during transplant and contribute to allograft dysfunction. While many drivers of LIRI have been well-characterized, the relationships between LIRI and later immunological signatures remain poorly understood, possibly because of limited integrated studies examining immunological signatures across the LT process. Furthermore, the role of underlying disease in LT remains poorly understood as it is unknown if later immunological signatures are universal or etiology dependent. To better examine etiology- and LIRI-driven immunological mechanisms across the LT lifetime, we collected cytokine and liver function test (LFT) measurements from LT donors and recipients at multiple pre- and post-operative timepoints. By developing a tensor-based factorization method to integrate these longitudinal measurements, we reduced the datasets to four immunological signatures that manifested across cytokines, LFTs, and time. Correlative analyses revealed associations between these integrated immunological signatures with etiology and LIRI. Later integration of allograft survival into this factorization method reduced these four signatures to two that were predictive of five-year allograft survival. Examination of these signatures prognostic of allograft survival found that CD4+ hyperpolarization towards Th1 or Th2 subtypes impaired growth factor expression and led to increased allograft loss risk. Clinical correlates revealed that donor and recipient age alongside etiology and donor liver health modulate this balance of CD4+ polarization in LT. Collectively, these results link immunological mechanisms to etiology and LIRI offering immediately actionable clinical insights alongside etiology- and donor-specific therapeutic targets for improving LT outcomes."
"As an intraflagellar transport (IFT) cargo adaptor, the BBSome targets the basal body region located just below the transition zone (TZ) before proceeding to cross the TZ for ciliary entry. This process of TZ crossing crucially governs BBSome presence and quantity available for signaling protein coupling within cilia, influencing the dynamic behavior of signaling proteins in cilia by controlling their ciliary removal. Our previous study revealed that the GTPase RAB18 binds to its BBSome effector in the basal bodies right below the TZ and recruits the BBSome to cross the TZ for ciliary entry by lateral transport between the plasma and ciliary membranes. However, the mechanism by which RAB18 is activated to accomplish this function has remained elusive. This study uncovers that, under physiological conditions, Chlamydomonas RAB23 in its GDP-bound state (RAB23-GDP) predominantly localizes to the same basal body region as RAB18-GDP and activates RAB18-GDP as a RAB18-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor. RAB18-GDP attaches to the membrane and binds to the BBSome. This interaction occurs independently of anterograde IFT association, allowing the BBSome to diffuse through the TZ and enter cilia. Subsequently, RAB23-GDP facilitates its own ciliary entry by binding to the RAB18-GTP/BBSome entity as a BBSome cargo. Our findings establish a model where the BBSome enters cilia through the RAB23-RAB18 module-mediated inward BBSome TZ diffusion pathway. According to this model, hedgehog signaling defects caused by rab23 mutations could induce Carpenter syndrome in humans, providing a mechanistic understanding behind the inward BBSome TZ passage required for proper ciliary signaling.

Significance statementCertain ciliary signaling proteins are removed from cilia through the outward BBSome transition zone (TZ) diffusion pathway. The inward BBSome TZ crossing is orchestrated by RAB18. The current study unveils that RAB23 in its GDP-bound state (RAB23-GDP) and RAB18-GDP predominantly localize to the same basal body region located just below the TZ. RAB23-GDP activates RAB18-GDP as a RAB18-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor. RAB18-GTP subsequently recruits the BBSome as its effector to cross the TZ for ciliary entry. Following this, RAB23-GDP enters cilia as a BBSome cargo. The regulatory interplay between RAB23 and RAB18, with RAB23 promoting inward BBSome TZ crossing via RAB18, establishes a molecular mechanism for the BBSome-dependent retrieval of signaling proteins from cilia."
"BackgroundCancer cells within tumors exhibit a wide range of phenotypic states driven by non-genetic mechanisms in addition to extensively studied genetic alterations. Conversions among cancer cell states can result in intratumoral heterogeneity which contributes to metastasis and development of drug resistance. However, mechanisms underlying the initiation and/or maintenance of such phenotypic plasticity are poorly understood. In particular, the role of intercellular communications in phenotypic plasticity remains elusive.

MethodsIn this study, we employ a multiscale inference-based approach using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to explore how intercellular interactions influence phenotypic dynamics of cancer cells, particularly cancers undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In addition, we use mathematical models based on our data-driven findings to interrogate the roles of intercellular communications at the cell populations from the viewpoint of dynamical systems.

ResultsOur inference approach reveals that signaling interactions between cancerous cells in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) result in the reinforcement of the phenotypic transition in single cells and the maintenance of population-level intratumoral heterogeneity. Additionally, we find a recurring signaling pattern across multiple types of cancer in which the mesenchymal-like subtypes utilize signals from other subtypes to support its new phenotype, further promoting the intratumoral heterogeneity. Our models show that inter-subtype communication both accelerates the development of heterogeneous tumor populations and confers robustness to their steady state phenotypic compositions.

ConclusionsOur work highlights the critical role of intercellular signaling in sustaining intratumoral heterogeneity, and our approach of computational analysis of scRNA-seq data can infer inter- and intra-cellular signaling networks in a holistic manner."
"Pathological cardiac remodeling is associated with the reactivation of fetal genes, yet the extent of the hearts fetal gene program and its impact on proteome compositions remain incompletely understood. Here, using a new proteome-wide protein ratio quantification strategy with mass spectrometry, we identify pervasive isoform usage shifts in fetal and postnatal mouse hearts, involving 145 pairs of highly homologous paralogs and alternative splicing-derived isoform proteins. Proteome-wide ratio comparisons readily rediscover hallmark fetal gene signatures in muscle contraction and glucose metabolism pathways, while revealing novel isoform usage in mitochondrial and gene expression proteins, including PPA1/PPA2, ANT1/ANT2, and PCBP1/PCBP2 switches. Paralogs with differential fetal usage tend to be evolutionarily recent, consistent with functional diversification. Alternative splicing adds another rich source of fetal isoform usage differences, involving PKM M1/M2, GLS-1 KGA/GAC, PDLIM5 long/short, and other spliceoforms. When comparing absolute protein proportions, we observe a partial reversion toward fetal gene usage in pathological hearts. In summary, we present a ratiometric catalog of paralogs and spliceoform pairs in the cardiac fetal gene program. More generally, the results demonstrate the potential of applying the proteome-wide ratio test concept to discover new regulatory modalities beyond differential gene expression."
"Plastic debris is a pervasive environmental pollutant with polyethylene (PE) among the most abundant floating polymers in marine environments. While microbial colonisation of marine plastics has been extensively documented, studies predominantly focus on Northern Hemisphere coastal waters, leaving microbial dynamics in remote Southern Hemisphere oceanic regions poorly characterised. In this study, we employed ribosomal amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics to characterise microbial colonisation patterns on PE films deployed during two oceanographic transects across the Southern Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean over 14 days of incubation. We evaluated environmental factors including geographic location, incubation regime (indoor/outdoor), and exposure conditions (UV radiation, temperature, and salinity) as potential drivers shaping microbial communities. Our results demonstrate clear differentiation in microbial community structure driven primarily by transect location and environmental conditions, rather than material type. Dominant taxa identified included Pseudomonadota known for hydrocarbon degrading capabilities and Cyanobacteria associated with phototrophic traits. Metagenomic analyses revealed enrichment of functional pathways linked to biofilm formation, hydrocarbon degradation, and iron metabolism. This study expands the current understanding of microbial colonisation processes on marine plastics, highlighting environmental factors influencing early plastisphere community structure and functional potential in understudied oceanic regions."
"Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally defined by the progressive degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons; however, accumulating evidence highlights extensive cortical dysfunctions as key contributors to motor and non-motor symptoms. Despite this growing recognition, the precise mechanisms underlying cortical network disruptions and their contribution to PD pathophysiology remain poorly understood, particularly in relation to parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs) and maladaptive plasticity. Here, we investigate the dysregulation of cortical network homeostasis in PD using a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model, focusing on the progressive disruption of parvalbumin-positive interneuron (PV-IN) connectivity, excitatory/inhibitory balance, and neuroinflammatory responses. Using a multimodal approach integrating longitudinal electrophysiology, wide-field calcium imaging, and histological analyses, we revealed striking alterations in cortical activity and connectivity. Specifically, we observed pathological high-gamma hyperactivity during movement, accompanied by severe disruptions in PV-IN connectivity across motor and somatosensory cortices. Histological analyses further revealed synaptic imbalances and microglial dysregulation, suggesting an extensive cortical response to dopaminergic loss. These findings indicate that PV-IN dysfunction drives cortical maladaptive plasticity, leading to network desynchronization and motor deficits. By reframing PD as a disorder of cortical network homeostasis, this study provides novel mechanistic insights and identifies cortical plasticity as a promising therapeutic target for disease modification."
"The stink bug complex is a major agricultural pest for soybean crops, significantly reducing productivity. Genetic resistance is the most effective control strategy, but its quantitative nature and labor-intensive phenotyping make its implementation in breeding programs challenging. This study explored high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with RGB cameras to evaluate a soybean population and identify stink bug resistance by correlating image-derived features and machine learning (ML) models. Using an alpha-lattice design with three replications, we phenotyped 304 soybean lines over two seasons under natural stink bug infestations. We manually evaluated five traits associated with stink bug resistance and correlated them with color, texture, and histogram features from aerial images. Three ML models--AdaBoost, SVM, and MLP-- were tested to predict these traits. VIs, especially the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index at the first percentile (VARI_P25) and texture-based indices at 45{degrees} and 135{degrees}, effectively predicted traits in stressed environments, particularly during flights near maturation. While ML models showed good predictive ability for yield, healthy seed weight, and maturity, they were less effective for stink bug resistance. Increasing the number of UAV flights modestly improved predictive accuracy, though predicting traits across different seasons remained challenging. Despite this, indices like VARI_25P were valuable for screening and excluding less promising genotypes, optimizing breeding program resources. This pioneering work offers valuable insights and highlights the need for further research to optimize resistance selection, promising significant advances in soybean breeding for stink bug resistance."
"Deciphering cell signaling pathways is essential for advancing our understanding of basic biology, disease mechanisms, and the development of innovative therapeutic interventions. Recent advancements in multi-omics technologies enable us to capture cell signaling information in a more meaningful context. However, omics data is inherently complex--high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and extensive--making it challenging for human interpretation. Currently, computational tools capable of inferring cell signaling pathways from multi-omics data are very limited, underscoring the urgent need to develop such methods.

To address this challenge, we developed Incytr, a method that facilitates the efficient discovery of cell signaling pathways by integrating diverse data modalities, including transcriptomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and kinomics. We demonstrate Incytrs application in elucidating cell signaling within the contexts of COVID-19, Alzheimers disease, and cancer. Incytr successfully rediscovered known subpathways in these diseases and generated novel hypotheses for cell-type-specific signaling pathways supported by multiple data modalities. We illustrate how overlaying Incytr-identified pathways with prior knowledge from biomarker and small molecule drug databases can be used to facilitate target and drug discovery. Overall, as we demonstrated here, with the use of simple natural language processing AI models, these pathways could serve as a discovery tool to deepen our understanding of cell-cell communication semantics and co-evolution."
"Bacteria employ sophisticated post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms to adapt to environmental changes. Carbon storage regulator A (CsrA), a highly conserved small RNA-binding protein, serves as a critical post-transcriptional regulator by recognizing GGA motifs in target transcripts and typically repressing translation. Despite extensive research, how this conserved regulator has evolved diverse species-specific regulatory networks remains unclear. Here, using Bacillus subtilis as an experimental chassis, we have developed Swarm-seq -- a high-throughput functional genomics platform capable of assessing CsrA homologs across the Bacterial domain for their ability to regulate flagella-dependent swarming motility. Systematically testing over five-hundred codon-optimized csrA homologs for flagellin (Hag) repression revealed striking functional divergence, i.e., broadly two classes of CsrAs. Class I, exemplified by CsrAHp from Helicobacter pylori and RsmN from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strongly inhibited swarming, while Class II, exemplified by CsrAEc from Escherichia coli and RsmA from P. aeruginosa failed despite high sequence conservation. This differential activity occurred despite all proteins targeting identical GGA motifs in the hag transcripts 5UTR, indicating evolutionary plasticity in RNA-binding specificity beyond motif recognition. We propose that this plasticity enables a conserved global regulator to develop species-specific regulons through subtle structural adaptations, facilitating diverse physiological responses across bacterial taxa. Our findings establish B. subtilis as a powerful platform for characterizing CsrA homologs from genetically intractable bacteria, providing insights into post-transcriptional regulatory network evolution."
"BackgroundHorizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays an important evolutionary role in prokaryotes, but it is thought to be less frequent in mammals. We previously reported that cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) - chromosomal fragments released from the billions of dying cells that circulate in human blood - are horizontally transferred to healthy cells with biological effects. However, the underlying mechanism and function of these effects remained unclear.

MethodsWe treated NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts cells with cfChPs isolated from human serum and serially passaged the cells. The intracellular activities of cfChPs were analysed using chromatin fibre fluorography, cytogenetic analysis, immuno-fluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridisation.

ResultsWe discovered that the internalised cfChPs were almost exclusively comprised of non-coding DNA, and the disparate DNA sequences contained within them had randomly combined to form complex concatemers some of which were ostensibly multi-mega base pairs in size. The concatemers exhibited variable and bizarre spatial relationships with the host cell interphase DNA with many remaining in the cytoplasm and others aligning themselves with the mouse chromosomal DNA. The concatemers autonomously performed many functions attributable to the nuclear genome. Being associated with DNA polymerase, the concatemers could synthesize DNA and autonomously replicate themselves without heed to the mitotic cycle of the host cell. They could synthesise RNA, RNA polymerase, ribosomal RNA, ribosomal proteins, and generate numerous human proteins, including oncogenes, within the mouse cells which manifested as complex and highly amplified multi-peptide fusion proteins. The concatemers harboured human LINE-1 and Alu elements, which being associated with DNA polymerase, reverse transcriptase and transposes could markedly amplify themselves and increase their copy number with time in culture with the potential to rearrange themselves within the mouse genome. The above findings were reproducible in four other cell lines derived from different species suggesting that horizontal transfer of cfChPs may be a universal phenomenon.

ConclusionsOur results lead us to propose that: 1) a cell simultaneously harbours two autonomous genome forms: one that is inherited (hereditary genome) and numerous others that are acquired (satellite genomes); 2) satellite genomes may potentially have evolutionary functions given their ability to serve as vehicles for transposable elements and to generate a plethora of novel proteins; 3) transposable elements are ""foreign"" genetic elements that are acquired from dying cells via HGT; 4) non-coding DNA has many hidden biological functions that remain dormant but are activated following cellular apoptosis to become detectable in association with the cfChP concatemers; 5) ""within-self"" HGT occurs in mammals on a massive scale via the medium of cfChP concatemers that have undergone extensive and complex modifications resulting in their behaviour as ""foreign"" genetic elements.

"Coleoid cephalopods such as the common octopus have a complex visual system, with a camera-type eye and a large optic lobe, that evolved independently from its counterpart in vertebrates. However, the molecular and neurochemical basis of signalling in Octopus visual circuits is not well understood. Through heterologous expression of ligand-gated ion channel genes from Octopus vulgaris, we have identified and characterised novel ionotropic receptors for two of the major optic lobe neurotransmitters, dopamine and acetylcholine. One of these, DopC1, defines a new class of dopamine-gated cation channels that is broadly conserved in many invertebrates. Dopamine robustly stimulates neural activity in the optic lobe, particularly in layers where DopC1 is expressed, consistent with a role for this channel in excitatory neurotransmission. A second protein, AChRB1, forms acetylcholine-gated anion channels and is implicated in inhibition of dopaminergic amacrine cells in the outer granular layer (OGL). This combination of inhibitory cholinergic input and excitatory dopaminergic output may allow OGL amacrine cells to carry out lateral inhibition; thus, despite their very different functional and neurochemical properties, Octopus amacrine cells may execute similar computations to amacrine and horizontal cells in the vertebrate retina."
"Oculomotor function is a sensitive marker of neurological impairment with smooth pursuit deficiencies investigated in various disorders. However, the oculomotor deficits following traumatic brain injury (TBI) have not been fully characterized. In this study, we employed a novel bedside eye-tracking paradigm to assess oculomotor dysfunction in 30 TBI patients and 30 age-matched controls. Our paradigm utilized short, repeated linear tracking segments with head-free recording, enabling the extraction of multiple oculomotor indices, including saccadic pursuit, tracking deviation under occlusion, initial tracking speed, initial saccade latency, pupil response, and vergence instability. TBI patients exhibited widespread deficits across these indices (AUC = 0.71-0.84), which correlated significantly with functional recovery, as measured by the Functional Independence Measure (R = 0.41-0.78, p < 0.001) but not with the initial Glasgow Coma Scale scores. These findings suggest that TBI disrupts multiple components of the oculomotor system, extending to predictive tracking, pupil-linked arousal, and binocular coordination. Additionally, preliminary testing in disorders of consciousness (DOC) patients revealed fragmented tracking, suggesting a potential application for assessing perceptual awareness. Our findings support the use of eye tracking as a promising tool for quantifying brain function in TBI, with potential applications in prognosis, rehabilitation monitoring, and broader neurological assessment."
"Theories of predictive processing propose that sensory systems constantly predict incoming signals, based on spatial and temporal context. However, evidence for prediction in sensory cortex largely comes from artificial experiments using simple, highly predictable stimuli, that arguably encourage prediction. Here, we test for sensory prediction during natural scene perception. Specifically, we use deep generative modelling to quantify the spatial predictability of receptive field (RF) patches in natural images, and compared those predictability estimates to brain responses in the mouse visual cortex - while rigorously accounting for established tuning to a rich set of low-level image features and their local statistical context -- in a large scale survey of high-density recordings from the Allen Institute Brain Observatory. This revealed four insights. First, cortical responses across the mouse visual system are shaped by sensory predictability, with more predictable image patches evoking weaker responses. Secondly, visual cortical neurons are primarily sensitive to the predictability of higher-level image features, even in neurons in the primary visual areas that are preferentially tuned to low-level visual features. Third, unpredictability sensitivity is stronger in the superficial layers of primary visual cortex, in line with predictive coding models. Finally, these spatial prediction effects are independent of recent experience, suggesting that they rely on long-term priors about the structure of the visual world. Together, these results suggest visual cortex might predominantly predict sensory information at higher levels of abstraction - a pattern bearing striking similarities to recent, successful techniques from artificial intelligence for predictive self-supervised learning."
"Volunteer-based biodiversity recording is a powerful source of scalable data yet to be used to its full potential by the scientific community. Coastal ecosystems are varied and diverse, making it difficult for managers to identify flexible methods for monitoring biological components. Emerging technologies such as environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis are promising for measuring aquatic biodiversity, yet most management organizations lack personnel and capacity to collect molecular data.

Here we investigate, together as professional and non-professional scientists, the efficacy of a quasi-passive eDNA capture technique. Volunteer SCUBA divers and snorkelers used low-cost materials, namely cotton medical gauze, to capture eDNA via swimming. We compared this method to conventional eDNA capture techniques in an aquarium and nature, collectively iterating the field and laboratory procedures to improve feasibility.

With a small (< 30) network of volunteers, we detected 275 unique teleost and elasmobranch species from varied marine habitats spanning 90 degrees of latitude. The swimming motion of divers was more effective than stationary soaking and the fish communities sampled by divers were comparable to that of conventional eDNA samples.

The ease of this technique matched by the eagerness and generosity of volunteers presents an untapped, viable approach for scaling multi-species marine eDNA monitoring as well as an avenue for improving science literacy.

Upregulation of the serine synthesis pathway (SSP) can fuel tumor growth, and cancers with this phenotype are often sensitive to SSP inhibitors. In parallel, dietary restriction of serine and glycine (SG) can suppress some cancers, but the determinants of sensitivity to this approach are poorly understood. This is especially true in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where serine metabolism has been less explored. We report that a subset of human AML cell lines and primary samples are completely dependent on external serine, known as serine auxotrophy. These leukemias consistently suppressed the SSP enzyme PSAT1, failed to synthesize serine, responded to SG restriction in vivo, and were rescued by restoring PSAT1. We also found that AML with an SF3B1 K700E mutation showed additional dependence on the SSP enzyme PHGDH, that SG restriction synergized with venetoclax in serine auxotrophic AML, and that MECOM rearrangement was strongly associated with PSAT1 suppression and serine auxotrophy. These findings define a metabolically distinct AML subtype and nominate it for targeting by SG restriction."
"Obesity is a global health concern affecting more than one-third of the adult population worldwide. Epidemiological studies indicate that body fat distribution, more than overall adiposity, is a key risk factor for obesity-related diseases. Genome-wide association studies revealed that RSPO3 is associated with body fat distribution. Additionally, marked sex differences in body fat distribution are largely influenced by estrogen, suggesting that exploring the relationship between estrogen and RSPO3 expression may illuminate the mechanisms underlying the sexual dimorphism of fat distribution. We revisited a comprehensive set of gene expression data from humans and mice to explore these mechanisms. We assessed RSPO3 expression in male and female adipose tissues and utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics to examine RSPO3's function within different tissues. Our findings confirmed significantly higher RSPO3 expression in male adipose tissue compared to female. Furthermore, our data for the first time suggest that estrogen plays a crucial role in fat distribution, as blocking estrogen signaling upregulates RSPO3 expression. In mouse liver, we observed a correlation between sex-specific ADK overexpression and RSPO3 expression, resulting in increased obesity and hepatocyte expansion via WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling in male mice. This study sheds light on how estrogen influences sexual dimorphism in fat distribution and underscores RSPO3's vital role in this process. These insights open new avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions addressing obesity and metabolic diseases with a focus on sex-specific factors."
"Abnormal DNA levels, such as aneuploidy and polyploidy, can indicate cellular transformation and cancer; however, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. All tumor viruses inherently cause abnormal DNA content in cells due to their oncogenes. During infections, adenovirus (Ad) oncogenes--early region 1A (E1A), early region 4 open reading frame 3 (E4orf3), and E4 open reading frame 1 (E4orf1)--promote the abnormal buildup of cellular DNA. Previous studies have described how E1A and E4orf3 lead infected cells to accumulate abnormal DNA content; however, the role of E4orf1 remains speculative. In this study, we generated cells that express E4orf1 to investigate its role in abnormal DNA content. The E4orf1-expressing cells initially exhibited no increase in DNA content compared to the control group. However, after Ad infection, they displayed higher ploidy levels. To detail how E4orf1 influences ploidy levels in Ad-infected cells, we employed pharmacological agents that target E4orf1 signaling. Our results indicate that E4orf1 enhances signaling from insulin and growth factor receptors to AKT and NF-{kappa}B, creating a feedback loop that elevates levels of cellular DNA in Ad-infected cells.

Author SummaryThe early region 4 open reading frame 1 of adenovirus (E4orf1) is recognized for its ability to initiate signals that convert normal cells into cancerous ones. In the initial stages of cancer, cells exhibit DNA content that exceeds the typical levels seen during the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. This study demonstrates that E4orf1 can trigger a feedback loop involving EGFR, INSR, IGF1R, AKT, and NF-kB, which is both dependent on and independent of PI3 kinase and leads to the accumulation of abnormal DNA content."
"In field production, beneficial microbial agents are typically applied along with key resources that beneficial microbes prefer to utilize. This practice aims to help the beneficial microbes colonize the field and exert their disease resistance functions. However, the mechanisms by which these key resources influence the colonization and disease resistance effects of beneficial microbes remain unknown. In this study, we found that inulin can enhance the growth capacity of Lysinibacillus sphaericus HR92 and its ability to inhibit Ralstonia solanacearum. Further investigation revealed that inulin can enhance strain HR92s flagellar assembly, bacterial chemotaxis, fatty acid metabolism, and siderophore synthesis capabilities, ultimately improving strain HR92s effectiveness in controlling bacterial wilt. Moreover, adding inulin to the soil can enrich Pseudarthrobacter strains. This genus enhances the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of the antibacterial substance HR92, and competes for nutrients with Ralstonia solanacearum, thereby further inhibiting the occurrence of bacterial wilt disease. Additionally, the combination of inulin and Pseudarthrobacter strains upregulates the valine and leucine pathway genes in strain HR92. These genes play a crucial role in the synthesis of surfactin and the antimicrobial VOC 3-methyl-1-butanol. We have demonstrated that the addition of key resources not only enhances the control efficacy of beneficial bacteria against soil-borne diseases but also enriches the ""helpers"" of beneficial bacteria in soil.

ImportanceRalstonia solanacearum is a plant pathogen that can cause bacterial wilt in several important crops. Given the limitations of beneficial bacterial inoculation, we propose a strategy to enhance the biocontrol efficacy of beneficial microorganisms by utilizing key resources. In this study, we demonstrate that key resources inulin can improve the biological control effects of beneficial bacteria, thereby maintaining plant health. Furthermore, we found that increasing the concentration of inulin altered the diversity of the rhizosphere microbiota and specifically enriched the abundance of Pseudarthrobacter, which compete with pathogens for nutrients on one hand and, on the other hand, synergize with inulin to enhance the biocontrol efficacy of the beneficial biacterium HR92. Together, our study reveals that key resources can enhance the biocontrol efficacy of beneficial bacteria and enrich potential beneficial bacteria in resident microbial communities, further reducing tomato diseases."
"Mapping the brains fiber network is crucial for understanding its function and malfunction, but resolving nerve trajectories over large fields of view is challenging. Electron microscopy only studies small brain volumes, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has limited spatial resolution, and polarization microscopy provides unidirectional orientations in birefringence-pre-serving tissues. Scattered light imaging (SLI) has previously enabled micron-resolution mapping of multi-directional fibers in unstained brain cryo-sections. Here, we show that using a highly sensitive setup, computational SLI (ComSLI) can map fiber networks in histology independent of sample preparation, also in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues including whole hu-man brain sections. We showcase this method in new and archived, animal and human brain sec-tions, for different stains and steps of sample preparation (in paraffin, deparaffinized, stained) and for unstained fresh-frozen samples. Employing novel analyses, we convert microscopic orienta-tions to microstructure-informed fiber orientation distributions (FODs). Adapting MR tractog-raphy tools, we trace axonal trajectories via orientation distribution functions and microstructure-derived tractograms revealing white and gray matter connectivity. These allow us to identify al-tered microstructure in multiple sclerosis and leukoencephalopathy, reveal deficient tracts in hip-pocampal sclerosis and Alzheimers disease, and show key advantages over dMRI, polarization microscopy, and structure tensor analysis. Finally, we map fibers in non-brain tissues, including muscle, bone, and blood vessels, unveiling the tissues function. Our cost-effective, versatile ap-proach enables micron-resolution studies of intricate fiber networks across tissues, species, diseases, and sample preparations, offering new dimensions to neuroscientific and biomedical research."
"Insects demonstrate remarkable agility in flight despite constant changes in flight dynamics throughout their lives. However, it is unclear whether such resilience is conferred via purely feedback control or whether adaptive feedforward control mechanisms are present. This study examines whether adaptive feedforward control mechanisms are present in Drosophila melanogaster flight, by comparing the free-flight trajectories with and without wing damage and antennae ablation. Flies with partial wing excisions exhibited increased flight speeds in the dark compared to intact-wing controls. Upon exposure to visual contrast in light, the clipped-wing flies reduced their speed comparable to that of the control group flies. Notably, the lower speed persisted upon returning to the dark, indicating an enduring change to the flight controller. To discern between feedforward adaptation and a change in mechanosensory feedback gains, we replicated the experiment after ablating the antennal arista, the primary mechanosensors for sensing airspeed. Although flies with ablated antennae flew with greater variance in speed, they displayed a parallel trend in mean speed adaptation: increased speed in the dark, compensation in the light, and sustained lower speed in subsequent dark conditions. This consistent pattern strongly supports the involvement of adaptive feedforward control rather than the adjustment of mechanosensory feedback gains. Our investigation unveils an adaptive strategy in D. Melanogaster flight, illustrating its ability to set flight speed through adaptive feedforward control mechanisms."
"The timing of host cell lysis is a fundamental life history parameter in bacteriophages as it presents an evolutionary trade-off between maximizing intracellular phage replication and optimizing transmission to new host cells, ultimately determining viral fitness in dynamic bacterial populations. In the bacteriophage {lambda}, lysis time is dependent on the expression of a timekeeper protein, holin, which accumulates in the Escherichia coli inner membrane. Cell lysis is triggered when the membrane concentration of holin crosses a critical threshold level. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the rate of holin translation on lysis timing and its precision. We show that modulating holin translation efficiency through genetic modifications and antibiotic treatment alters bacteriophage lysis timing and its precision, providing insight into how phages optimize the evolutionary trade-off between replication and transmission. Reducing ribosomal binding affinity decreased holin expression and delayed lysis, while optimizing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence enhanced translation and accelerated lysis. Surprisingly, very low tetracycline concentrations may have improved translation efficiency and hastened lysis, whereas higher doses predictably delayed it. In all cases, longer lysis times corresponded with decreased timing variability. A model that incorporates stochastic gene expression with additional stochasticity in the initiation of holin expression was sufficient to explain the data. Thus, we demonstrated that modifying the rate of holin translation can be used as an evolutionary strategy to achieve optimum lysis timing.

ImportanceOur prior work demonstrated that phage lysis timing is calibrated to optimize fitness based on environmental conditions affecting host availability and phage replication. We identified an optimal threshold--the critical holin concentration--that minimizes lysis time variability. Genetic manipulation of the holin gene altered the lysis threshold and generated phages with non-optimal early and late lysis times. The current study reveals that adjusting holin translation rates offers another mechanism for modifying lysis timing. Phages therefore have multiple means to adjust the timing of host lysis in order to maximize fitness under different selective pressures."
"T-cell immunogenicity, the ability of peptide fragments to elicit T-cell responses, is a critical determinant of the safety and efficacy of protein therapeutics and vaccines. While deep learning offers promise for in silico prediction, the scarcity of comprehensive immunogenicity data remains a major challenge. We present TITANiAN, a novel multi-domain deep learning framework that leverages adversarial domain adaptation to integrate diverse immunologically relevant data sources, including MHC presentation, pMHC binding affinity, TCR-pMHC interaction, T-cell activation, and source organism information. Validated through rigorous leakage-controlled benchmarks, TITANiAN demonstrates exceptional performance in its primary fine-tuned task (TITANiAN-IM), predicting T-cell activation for specific peptide-MHC pairs. Remarkably, it also predicts ADA-inducing potential of therapeutic antibodies without requiring MHC inputs. This success attributed to TITANiANs biologically grounded and data-driven multi-domain pre-training, with component contributions further confirmed by extensive ablation studies. In addition, TITANiAN supports broader immunogenicity-related tasks such as molecular binding prediction, enabled by its flexible pretraining architecture. TITANiANs consistent and robust performance highlights its potential to advance the development of safer and more effective vaccines and protein therapeutics. The model is publicly accessible via a web server: https://galaxy.seoklab.org/design/titanian/."
"The human retina exhibits complex cellular heterogeneity which is critical for visual function, yet comprehensive ethnic-specific references are scarce in ophthalmic transcriptomics. The lack of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from Asian populations particularly Chinese donors imposes significant limitations in understanding population-specific retinal biology. We constructed the first comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human retina from Chinese donors, generated through high-throughput scRNA-seq of [~]290,000 viable cells obtained from 18 fresh retinal specimens (living donor and post-mortem specimens). Our multi-level analysis identified 10 distinct retinal cell types, encompassing all major neuronal lineages, Muller glia, astrocytes, microglia. Detailed subcluster analyses further revealed extensive heterogeneity, identifying distinct subtypes within several cell populations such as 7 amacrine cell subtypes and 14 bipolar cell subtypes. Concurrently, through systematic analysis of delineated subtype-specific molecular programs, we mapped their associated biological signaling pathways, functions, and mechanistic processes. This analysis explained the critical involvement of these subpopulations in core biological processes including synaptic organization, neurotransmission, and phototransduction cascades, potentially governing retinal homeostatic regulation and disease mechanisms. Single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human retina from Chinese donors describes a comprehensive cellular landscape, encompassing major cell types and subtypes including neuronal, glial, and immune populations. This ethnic-specific atlas provided an important reference for understanding retinal development, cellular interaction and disease pathogenesis in Chinese populations, addressing a longstanding gap in ophthalmic transcriptomic resources."
"Current therapeutic strategies for Alzheimers disease (AD) target amyloid-beta (A{beta}) fibrils and high molecular weight protofibrils associated with plaques, but molecular cascades associated with AD may drive neural systems failure before A{beta} plaque deposition in AD. Employing hippocampal electrophysiological recordings and dynamic calcium imaging across the sleep-wake cycle in a freely behaving mouse model of AD before A{beta} plaques accumulated, we detected marked impairments of hippocampal systems function: In a spatial behavioral task, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) of the hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations was impaired and place cell calcium fluctuations were hyper-synchronized with the theta oscillation. These changes were not observed in REM sleep. In subsequent slow wave sleep (SWS), place cell reactivation was reduced. These degraded neural functions underlying memory encoding and consolidation support targeting pathological processes of the pre-plaque phase of AD to treat and prevent hippocampal impairments."
"Supervised machine learning models depend on training datasets with positive and negative examples. Therefore, dataset composition directly impacts model performance and bias. Given the importance of machine learning for immunotherapeutic design, we examined how different negative class definitions affect model generalization and rule discovery for antibody-antigen binding. Using synthetic structure-based binding data, we evaluated models trained with various definitions of negative sets. Our findings reveal that high out-of-distribution performance can be achieved when the negative dataset contains more similar samples to the positive dataset despite a lower within-distribution performance. Furthermore, leveraging ground truth information, we show that binding rules discovered as associated with positive data change based on the negative data used. Validation on experimental data supported simulation-based observations. This work underscores the role of dataset composition, including negative data selection, in creating robust, generalizable, and biology-aware sequence-based ML models."
"Detecting multiple cancers with a single, non-invasive liquid biopsy test remains a challenge, as no universally shared cancer biomarker with clinical significance has been identified in bodily fluids. In this study, we identified proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a well-established pathological cancer biomarker in tissue biopsies, as being secreted into peripheral bodily fluids within exosomes. Our research demonstrated that cultured cancer cells continuously release large quantities of exosomal PCNA into their surrounding media. Furthermore, we confirmed its presence in human serum. Most importantly, cancer patients exhibited significantly higher levels of exosomal PCNA in their sera compared to healthy individuals.

To assess its diagnostic potential, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of exosomal PCNA in a cohort of cancer patients and healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed a sensitivity of 77.2% and a specificity of 94.4%. These findings establish exosomal PCNA in peripheral bodily fluids as a promising universal biomarker for the early detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of multiple cancers through liquid biopsy."
"Understanding cortical circuit development requires tracking neuronal activity across days in the growing brain. While in vivo calcium imaging now enables such longitudinal studies, automated tools for reliably tracking large populations of neurons across sessions remain limited. Here, we present a novel cell-tracking method based on sequential image registration, validated on calcium imaging data from the barrel cortex of mouse pups over one postnatal week. Our approach enables robust long-term analysis of several hundreds of individual neurons, allowing quantification of neuronal dynamics and representational stability over time. Using this method, we identified a key developmental transition in neuronal activity statistics, marking the emergence of arousal state modulation. Beyond this key finding, our method provides an essential tool for tracking developmental trajectories of individual neurons, which could help identify potential deviations associated with neurodevelopmental disorders."
"The spatial organization of RNA condensates is fundamental for understanding of basic cellular functions, but may also provide pivotal insights into diseases. One of the major challenges to understanding the role of condensates is the lack of technologies to map condensate-scale protein architecture at subcompartmental or nanoscale resolution. To address this, we introduce HCR-Proxy, a proximity labelling technique that couples Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR)-based signal amplification with in situ proximity biotinylation (Proxy), enabling proteomic profiling of RNA-proximal proteomes at subcompartmental resolution. We benchmarked HCR-Proxy using nascent pre-rRNA targets to investigate the distinct proteomic signatures of the nucleolar subcompartments and to uncover a spatial logic of protein partitioning shaped by RNA sequence. Our results demonstrate HCR-Proxys ability to provide spatially-resolved maps of RNA interactomes within the nucleolus, offering new insights into the molecular organisation and compartmentalisation of condensates. This subcompartment-specific nucleolar proteome profiling enabled integration with deep learning frameworks, which effectively confirmed a sequence-encoded basis for protein partitioning across nested condensate subcompartments, characterised by antagonistic gradients in charge, length, and RNA-binding domains. HCR-Proxy thus provides a scalable platform for spatially resolved RNA interactome discovery, bridging transcript localisation with proteomic context in native cellular environments.

"Trichodesmium, the predominant marine diazotrophic cyanobacterium, concurrently performs nitrogen (N2) fixation and photosynthesis, the latter of which produces oxygen (O2) that inhibits N2 fixation. Hopanoid lipids in Trichodesmium may play a role in dynamically regulating membrane permeability to O2, potentially alleviating O2 stress on N2 fixation. However, the physiological impacts of this dynamic permeability are not well understood. We developed a model showing that dynamically modulating membrane O2 permeability can enhance N2 fixation and growth of Trichodesmium by over 50%. High O2 permeability (1.5x10-4 of O2 diffusivity in seawater) during strong photosynthesis accelerates O2 exhaust, reducing energy-consuming photorespiration by [~]40%, while low O2 permeability (1.0x10-5 diffusivity) during active N2 fixation minimizes O2 stress on N2 fixation. Together, these mechanisms increase the carbon and iron use efficiencies by [~]70%. Our study provides a mechanistic and quantitative framework for how dynamic O2 permeability benefits Trichodesmium, offering insights potentially applicable to other diazotrophs.

IMPORTANCETrichodesmium is a key player in marine N2 fixation, essential for oceanic productivity and global biogeochemical cycles. However, a significant challenge arises from the concurrent photosynthetic production of O2 during N2 fixation, which can inhibit N2 fixation and cause energy-wasting photorespiration. We develop a physiological model showing that Trichodesmium may dynamically regulate membrane O2 permeability to enhance N2 fixation and growth. The model suggests two mechanisms: elevated O2 permeability during the early daytime of strong photosynthesis accelerates O2 exhaust to environment, reducing photorespiration, while reduced O2 permeability later limits O2 influx from environment, lowering wasteful respiration and maintaining a low intracellular O2 level for active N2 fixation. These adaptations improve the efficiency of carbon and iron utilization, thereby facilitating N2 fixation and growth in Trichodesmium. This study sheds light on how Trichodesmium and other N2-fixing microorganisms can optimize their physiological processes in response to environmental challenges.

HIGHLIGHTSO_LIWe developed a metabolic flux model of Trichodesmium, which resolves Dynamic cellular Permeability to O2 (DPO2).
C_LIO_LIDPO2 increases N2 fixation and growth rates.
C_LIO_LIDPO2 increases growth efficiency by reducing carbon wasting processes such as photorespiration and respiratory protection.
C_LIO_LIDPO2, as a result, also increases iron utilization efficiency.

"Standard techniques for detecting genomic rearrangements in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies have important limitations. We performed FFPE-compatible Hi-C on 44 clinical biopsies comprising large B-cell lymphomas (n=18), plasma cell neoplasms (n=14), and other diverse lymphoid cancers, identifying consistent topological differences between malignant B cell and plasma cell states. Hi-C detected expected oncogene rearrangements at high concordance with fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and supported enhancer-hijacking in recurrent rearrangements of BCL2, CCND1, and MYC, plus unanticipated variants involving homologous loci. Hi-C identified unanticipated non-coding rearrangements involving PD-1 ligand genes and other loci of potential therapeutic relevance, distinguished between functionally divergent classes of BCL6 rearrangements, and provided topological information supporting the interpretation of atypical MYC rearrangements. In biopsies lacking MYC-activating rearrangements, Hi-C revealed differential interactions with functionally-validated disease-specific native MYC locus enhancers. FFPE-compatible Hi-C detects oncogene rearrangements and their topological consequences at genome-wide scale, finding clinically-relevant drivers that are missed by standard approaches."
"Complex coacervates between bovine lactoferrin (LF) and low-methoxyl pectin (LMP) were prepared to encapsulate and deliver Fe(II) as an iron fortification ingredient in food, with the goal of enhancing the protein thermal stability and minimizing Fe(II) oxidation. The impact of pH and biopolymer ratio was investigated in terms of complex yield and iron encapsulation efficiency. The thermal stability of LF at 95 {degrees}C was determined by changes in turbidity, particle size, and LF retention by HPLC. The interaction between LF and LMP prevented thermal aggregation and circular dichroism analysis showed the complexation preserved the secondary structure of the protein. LF-LMP-Fe complexes contained 28-74 mg g-1 of total iron depending on the pH of formation, with <5% of the Fe released at neutral pH. The complex coacervation system shows promise as a thermally stable ingredient for iron delivery and food fortification."
"Molecular plasma membrane organization and dynamics play an important role in cellular signalling. Advances in our understanding of the nanoscale architecture of the plasma membrane heavily rely on the development of non-invasive experimental methods, particularly of advanced fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy techniques with high spatio-temporal resolution and sensitivity to local molecular properties. However, it remains difficult to combine several of them for a multimodal characterisation that would reduce the possibility of misinterpretations. Here, we integrated a spectral detector into a super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscope, achieving three goals. First, we show that compared to the standard ratiometric detection using fixed bandpass filters, the spectrally resolved acquisition together with spectral fitting or phasor analysis improves the accuracy of experiments determining membrane lipid order with polarity-sensitive probes multifold. Secondly, we demonstrate that this acquisition scheme allows the use of such probes in combination with other dyes with overlapping spectra, enabling co-localisation of the membrane order maps with other cellular structures of interest, e.g. fluorescently labelled proteins. Finally, we correlate the obtained membrane lipid order with the anomalous trapped diffusion properties of a fluorescent sphingomyelin lipid analogue in the plasma membrane of living cells, as determined by STED fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and highlight that some of the most apparent trapping sites locate at the boundaries of local ordered environments discernible by the introduced spectral STED microscopy. With additional measurements in model membranes and Monte-Carlo simulations we conclude that for sub-100 nm ordered environments uneven probe partitioning cannot by itself explain the trapping diffusion of SM in cells."
"Ageing is associated with neural alterations that impair cognitive abilities, particularly working memory (WM)--the capacity to temporarily store and manipulate information essential for daily functioning. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has shown promise in enhancing WM in older adults by modulating cortical excitability and promoting neuroplasticity. However, findings on the combined effects of tDCS and WM training remain inconsistent, particularly regarding transfer effects to non-trained WM tasks (near transfer) or other cognitive domains (far transfer).

This study examined the behavioural and neural effects of tDCS on distinct WM phases (encoding, retention/manipulation, recall) in older adults. Over three weeks, participants underwent six sessions of adaptive WM training paired with tDCS targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Neural activity was assessed via EEG, focusing on theta and alpha bands. Participants were divided into tDCS and placebo groups and completed two WM tests, the Letter Span and Corsi Test, with retention and manipulation conditions.

Results showed no additional behavioural or neural benefits of tDCS. However, both groups exhibited near-transfer effects that persisted one-month post-training. Neural changes varied by task: the Letter Span showed increased alpha power during manipulation, indicating enhanced maintenance of information during that phase, while the Corsi Test showed reduced left-hemisphere theta power during recall, reflecting reduced hemispheric asymmetry.

Inter-individual variability likely contributed to inconsistencies and a lack of correlations between outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of personalised tDCS protocols and suggest adaptive WM training can yield enduring cognitive and neural benefits in older adults."
"BackgroundThe axenisation of phototrophic eukaryotic microalgae has been studied for over a century, with antibiotics commonly employed to achieve axenic cultures. However, this approach often yields inconsistent outcomes and may contribute to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes. A comprehensive review of microalgal species and the methods used to achieve axeny could provide insights into potentially effective workflows and identify gaps for future exploration.

MethodsScholarly databases were systematically searched, supplemented by citation network analysis and AI-assisted tools, to collect studies on achieving axenic phototrophic eukaryotic microalgae cultures. Data about microalgal species, axenisation workflows, outcomes, and related factors (e.g., sampling locations, axenisation confirmation methods) were summarised. Network component analysis was used to identify clusters of commonly reported methods for diatoms, dinoflagellates, and green algae. A scoring framework was developed to assess the quality and reliability of evidence presented in the studies.

ResultsPromising workflows circumventing the use of antibiotics appear to be filtration {leftrightarrow} washing {leftrightarrow} micropicking for diatoms, micropicking {leftrightarrow} subculturing {leftrightarrow} flow cytometry for dinoflagellates, and anoxy {leftrightarrow} photosensitisation {leftrightarrow} streak plating for green algae. Evidence from the literature indicates that a combination of microscopy (e.g., epifluorescence), cell counting (e.g., agar plating), and sequencing (16S and/or 18S) could enhance confidence in confirming axeny.

ConclusionMore systematic and high quality primary research is required to identify effective workflows for other microalgal divisions and fortify / contradict the ones proposed herein based on network component analysis."
"Land abandonment is the single largest process of land-use change in the Global North driving succession and afforestation at continental scales, but assessing its impacts on soil microbial communities remains a challenge. Here, we established a nationwide successional gradient of paired grassland and forest sites to track developments in microbial structure and functioning following land abandonment and gradually changing plant communities. We show that microbes generally respond through threshold dynamics, leading to increasing functional but decreasing taxonomic diversity. Succession also increased the specialization of microbial nutrient (C-N-P) cycling genes while decreasing genetic redundancy, highlighting a putative trade-off between two desirable ecosystem properties: functional diversity and functional redundancy. Increasing fungal functional diversity underpinned higher microbial C-cycling capacity, underscoring the causal link between functional traits and ecosystem processes. Changing litter quality similarly provided a mechanistic link between plant and microbial communities despite otherwise largely decoupled successional developments. Land abandonment is frequently touted as an opportunity to increase biodiversity and carbon storage. Our results show that deeper knowledge about the multifaceted development of soil microbial communities and its links to plant communities during succession may be needed to fully grasp the impacts of global land abandonment processes."
"Human DExD/H-box RNA helicases are ubiquitous molecular motors that unwind and rearrange RNA secondary structures in an ATP-dependent manner. These enzymes play essential roles in nearly all aspects of RNA metabolism. While their biological functions are well-characterized, the kinetic mechanisms remain relatively understudied in vitro. In this study, we describe the development and optimization of a bioluminescence-based assay to kinetically characterize three human RNA helicases: MDA5, LGP2, and DDX1. The assays were conducted using annealed 24-mer RNA (blunt-ended double-stranded RNA) or double-stranded RNA (ds-RNA) with a 25- nt 3' overhang. These findings establish a robust and high-throughput in vitro assay suitable for a 384-well format, enabling the discovery and characterization of inhibitors targeting MDA5, LGP2, and DDX1. This work provides a valuable resource for advancing our understanding of these helicases and their therapeutic potential in Alzheimers disease."
"Whole-organism cell atlases have painted the cellular landscapes of individual species; however, comparing cells across the tree of life remains challenging. Most cross-species analyses are restricted to orthologous genes, while the complexity of atlas data constitutes an access barrier for many researchers. We developed a computational strategy to accelerate the exploration of cellular identities at scale. We integrated 30 atlases detailing the expression of 861,013 genes by 2,645,508 animal and plant cells and trained a universal model of cellular transcriptomes to track cell type diversification over evolutionary times. Transfer learning achieved cell type annotation of a de novo atlas of the insect Cryptocercus punctulatus within minutes. We devised a generative artificial intelligence approach to construct virtual cell atlases from genome sequences and used it to synthesise an atlas of the Tasmanian tiger, extinct since 1936. We then reduced the footprint of extant atlases by 100 times while retaining crucial information and developed interfaces to answer dozens of query types within seconds, boosting atlas exploration by [~]50,000 times."
"MotivationHaplotype blocks in the genome are informative of evolutionary processes and they play a pivotal role in describing the genomic variability across human populations and susceptibility/resistance to diseases. Several software have been developed for haplotype blocks detection, but they do not distinguish between the impacts of major and minor SNP alleles. In this study, we present a powerful haploblock detection software, specifically designed for identifying haploblocks associated with SNP minor allele haploblocks (MiA-haploblocks). These haploblocks are particularly important as they can significantly influence phenotypic traits, offering a novel approach for studying genetic associations and complex traits.

ResultsHaploExplore operates on VCF files containing phased data, exhibiting rapid processing times and generating user-friendly outputs. Its results are convergent for populations starting from 100 individuals. A comparative analysis of HaploExplore against other haploblock detection software revealed its superiority in terms of either simplicity, or flexibility, or speed, with the unique capability to target minor alleles. HaploExplore will be very useful for evolutionary genomics and for GWAS analysis in human diseases, given that the effects of genetic associations may accumulate within a specific haploblock."
"Fumarate-adding enzymes (FAE) are a subset of the glycyl radical enzyme superfamily involved in anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation. Benzylsuccinate synthase (BSS) catalyzes the enantiospecific formation of R-benzylsuccinate from toluene and fumarate, initiating anaerobic toluene degradation. In this paper, we present a detailed theoretical study of the reaction mechanism using classical molecular dynamics and multiscale modelling (QM:MM). We describe the potential energy surface of the reaction, confirming the previously postulated mechanism. However, the multiscale character of our model allowed to elucidate the origins of several experimentally observed catalytic phenomena, such as the inversion of the configuration of the benzylic atom upon C-C bond formation, syn addition of the abstracted H atom back to the benzylsuccinyl radical, or kinetic isotope effects in the range of 1.7-2.1. The obtained model is supported by microkinetic analysis and was able to explain and quantitatively predict the strict R-enantioselectivity of BSS, which is not enforced by the binding orientation of the fumarate, but by dynamic kinetic behaviour of toluene in the active site leading to faster production of the R-enantiomer. We were also able to explain the experimentally observed slow H/D exchange in the product during incubation with BSS in D2O, confirming the partial reversibility of the reaction. Our study contributes to the elucidation of the catalytic processes catalyzed by BSS and its role in the bioremediation of hydrocarbon pollutants."
"Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, play a crucial role in carbon cycling within marine environments. In coral reefs, dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by benthic primary producers such as algae fuels heterotrophic microbial growth, which can be detrimental to corals. While this microbialization process has been associated with the abundance and replication strategies of bacteriophages, the direct relationship between reef DOM composition and bacteriophage communities remains unclear. Here, we combine metabolomics, metagenomes, and viromes to demonstrate that phage abundances have significant relationships with DOM composition on the reefs of Curacao, Southern Caribbean. By constructing co-occurrence networks between free or cell-associated viruses and exometabolites, we identified thousands of statistically significant associations between phages and organic compounds. While total viral abundances did not significantly correlate with overall dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, cell-associated phages had significantly more positive associations with compounds that had a reduced nominal oxidative state of carbon (NOSC). Furthermore, temperate phages were more frequently correlated with metabolites exhibiting higher Gibbs energy than lytic phages. Six of the ten viruses with the highest number of positive associations with metabolites were temperate (i.e., encoded an integrase or were identified as a prophage), despite this network consisting of approximately 90% lytic viruses. These temperate viruses were predicted to infect members of the genus Sphingobium. Together, these findings reveal a connection between phage replication strategies and DOM energy availability with potential implications for coral reef biogeochemistry.

SignificanceCoral reefs are highly dynamic ecosystems where microbial communities and organic matter cycles are intricately linked. This study provides new insights into how bacteriophages interact with dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition, revealing that cell-associated bacteriophages, particularly temperate phages, are associated with more energy-rich organic compounds. These findings suggest that DOM may have a bottom-up influence on the lysis-lysogeny decision of temperate phages infecting their host or that lysogeny may play an underappreciated role in shaping the reef carbon cycle. Energy-rich organic compounds have generally been associated with increased algal abundances and coral decline. By demonstrating significant connections between viral infection strategies and the energy content of DOM, our results highlight the potential for phages to influence coral reef biogeochemistry and health."
"Climate change has had strong impacts on biodiversity, including well-documented shifts in the distributions and phenology of species. Reductions in body size represent a third pervasive biological response; it has garnered significantly less attention despite great ecological relevance. Theoretical frameworks-the temperature-size rule, Bergmanns rule, and Jamess rule-predict that warmer temperatures are associated with smaller body sizes in ectotherms. In contrast, empirical evidence concerning this pattern is mixed across both taxa and environments. In the present study, we applied computer vision techniques to historical data from two large butterfly museum collections, totaling 593 species across 10 terrestrial biomes over more than a century, in order to investigate long-term trends in butterfly body size. We measured forewing length through both manual image analyses and automated computer vision algorithms proxying body size and analyzed trends by using generalized additive models in order to consider a temporal, biome-specific pattern assessment. We have tested two hypotheses: that butterfly body size (1) declines over time, in conjunction with increasing ambient temperatures, in agreement with the temperature-size rule, and (2) its variation is more marked in warm, dry biomes. Results indicate a significant overall reduction in the body size of butterflies during the last century and that this reduction is indeed more pronounced in those biomes facing higher rises in temperature. These findings constitute large-scale evidence in support of the temperature-size rule and indicate a potential ecological impact of climate change on butterfly populations."
"The Yippee-like (YPEL) genes are highly conserved among all eukaryotic species, yet the molecular and cellular pathways that YPEL regulate are poorly understood. Human and animal studies suggest that YPEL is involved in nervous system functions. Here we report that YPEL is necessary for synapse development in neuromuscular junction and motor functions in Drosophila. YPEL interacts with the Drosophila p62, Refractory to sigma P, which forms cytoplasmic proteinaceous bodies for selective autophagy and signaling. YPEL overexpression decreased p62 bodies, while increased p62 bodies were observed in YPEL mutant neurons. Suppressing p62 bodies by reducing p62 gene dosage significantly alleviated both synaptic and locomotion defects in YPEL mutants, suggesting that YPEL acts through p62 for synapse development. On the other hand, suppressing p62 bodies via autophagy did not restore synapse development in YPEL mutants. Interestingly, reduced levels of reactive oxygen species were found in YPEL mutants, which is consistent with the role of p62 in promoting the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant pathway. Overexpressing Drosophila Nrf2, Cap  n collar (Cnc), phenocopied the synaptic and locomotion deficits in YPEL mutants. Importantly, both synaptic and locomotion defects were completely rescued by knocking down Cnc in YPEL mutant motor neurons. Taken together, our study demonstrates that YPEL negatively controls p62 - Nrf2 antioxidant pathway for neuromuscular synapse development and locomotion."
"Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) are widely used to uncover transcriptomic mechanisms underlying disease. Here, we present VINTAGE, an alternative TWAS framework designed to identify and decipher gene-trait associations through two complementary tests: a genetic variance test that generalizes TWAS and unifies it with SKAT, offering a clearer understanding of TWAS false signals when expression is not relevant to SNP-trait associations; and a local genetic correlation test that distinguishes it from TWAS by explicitly quantifying and testing the proportion of genetic effects on trait mediated through gene expression. Applied to eQTLGen and eighteen traits from UK Biobank, VINTAGE improved gene-trait association power by an average of 5% and 87% over SKAT and TWAS, respectively. VINTAGE is also the only method effective in assessing potential gene mediation effects, revealing that most genes lack detectable mediation effects (median = 12%), which explains the power advantage of VINTAGE and SKAT over TWAS. Notably, VINTAGE identified 61 genes with significant mediation, highlighting the role of expression in genetic influences on traits."
"Phrenic nerve stimulation can be used as an artificial ventilation method to reduce the adverse effects of mechanical ventilation. Detailed computational models and electromagnetic simulations are used to determine appropriate stimulation parameters. Therefore, tissue parameters have to be selected, but they vary widely in the literature.

Here, we evaluated the phrenic nerve activation threshold using minimum and maximum electrical conductivity values found in the literature of each modeled neck tissue type. To calculate the phrenic nerve activation threshold, an anatomical detailed finite element model of the neck and a biophysiological nerve model were used.

Considerable changes in nerve activation thresholds were found for the following tissue conductivities (with decreasing effects): muscle, skin, soft tissue, subcutaneous fat, and nerve tissue. Changes in the nerve activation threshold due to changes in skin conductivity occurred due to the bridging effect, which is an unwanted and avoidable effect during stimulation.

In conclusion, fat, muscle, nerve, and soft tissue require the most accurate tissue properties and geometric representation within the model."
"Adams-Oliver Syndrome (AOS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by scalp, limb, and cardiovascular defects. While variants in the NOTCH1 receptor, DLL4 ligand, and RBPJ transcription factor have been implicated in AOS, the driving tissue types and molecular mechanisms by which these variants cause pathogenesis are unknown. Here, we used quantitative binding assays to show that AOS-associated RBPJ missense variants compromise DNA binding but not cofactor binding. These findings suggest that AOS-associated RBPJ variants do not function as loss-of-function alleles but instead act as dominant-negative proteins that sequester cofactors from DNA. Consistent with this idea, mice carrying an AOS-associated Rbpj allele develop dominant phenotypes that include lethality and cardiovascular defects in a Notch1 heterozygous background, whereas Notch1 and Rbpj compound heterozygous null alleles are well-tolerated. To facilitate studies into the key tissues driving AOS pathogenesis, we employed conditional genetics to isolate the contribution of the vasculature to the development of AOS-like phenotypes. Importantly, our studies show that expression of the Rbpj AOS allele in endothelial cells is both necessary and sufficient to cause lethality and cardiovascular defects. These data establish that defective Notch1 signaling in the vasculature is a key driver of pathogenesis in this AOS mouse model."

Six silybin derivatives have been synthesized and tested in vitro for their cytotoxic effect on the human hepatocellular carcinoma line HepG2 using the MTT assay. Results indicate that the 3,5,7,20,23-penta-O-acetyl-2,3-dehydrosilybin possesses a stronger cytotoxic effect than that of the parent silybin by a factor of 12. This compound was further evaluated for its cytotoxic activity on Hep3B, Huh7, and Huh7R hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, giving similar potencies, arresting the cell cycle at S phase and causing apoptosis. These results illustrate the potential of silybin derivatives as therapeutics against liver cancer."
"The remarkable ability of a single genome sequence to encode a diverse collection of distinct cell types, including the thousands of cell types found in the mammalian brain, is a key characteristic of multicellular life. While it has been observed that some cell types are far more evolutionarily conserved than others, the factors driving these differences in evolutionary rate remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that highly abundant neuronal cell types may be under greater selective constraint than rarer neuronal types, leading to variation in their rates of evolution. To test this, we leveraged recently published cross-species single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets from three distinct regions of the mammalian neocortex. We found a strikingly consistent relationship where more abundant neuronal subtypes show greater gene expression conservation between species, which replicated across three independent datasets covering >106 neurons from six species. Based on this principle, we discovered that the most abundant type of neocortical neurons--layer 2/3 intratelencephalic excitatory neurons--has evolved exceptionally quickly in the human lineage compared to other apes. Surprisingly, this accelerated evolution was accompanied by the dramatic down-regulation of autism-associated genes, which was likely driven by polygenic positive selection specific to the human lineage. In sum, we introduce a general principle governing neuronal evolution and suggest that the exceptionally high prevalence of autism in humans may be a direct result of natural selection for lower expression of a suite of genes that conferred a fitness benefit to our ancestors while also rendering an abundant class of neurons more sensitive to perturbation."
"Human and animal studies have shown that risk factors for certain diseases are linked to our fathers physiological and psychological condition. So far, mainly in vitro evidence indicates extracellular vesicles (EVs) as one of the potential mediators of these paternal effects. In a full in vivo model system, we demonstrate that targeting the EV biogenesis pathway within somatic cells of the male Drosophila melanogaster reproductive tract induces sex-specific phenotypic changes in the progeny. These findings highlight the critical role of the EV pathway in paternal somatic cells in shaping the phenotypic destiny of the next generation and underscore the necessity for further investigations into the mechanisms of somatic to germline information transfer."
"Loss of dystrophin alters the biomechanical properties of skeletal muscle, including stiffness. Stiffness is typically assessed passively in excised muscle, but here we present the development of an in vivo rheological method to assess the mechanical properties of the tibialis anterior muscle in anaesthetised wild-type (WT; dystrophin-positive) and mdx (dystrophin-deficient) mice using a custom-designed apparatus compatible with an MCR 702 rheometer. To characterise stiffness, compressibility, and elasticity, rheological testing included compressive and shear strain protocols, along with recovery and assessments following contraction-induced strength loss. Relative to WT mice, the tibialis anterior of mdx mice were thicker, stiffer, and less compressible. These genotype differences aligned with hydroxyproline content, a marker of fibrosis. Post-deformation recovery was impaired in mdx mice under shear strain, and eccentric contraction-induced injury further increased stiffness and energy dissipation in the tibialis anterior of mdx mice. This rheological platform maintained the in vivo integrity of the tibialis anterior muscle of mice and consistently showed that storage and loss moduli can sensitively detect the detrimental impact of dystrophin-deficiency on the in vivo viscoelastic properties of skeletal muscle. This rheological platform, termed myomechanical profiling could be a viable and sensitive tool for assessing muscle quality and mechanical behaviour of skeletal muscle where viscoelastic properties are affected by disease."
"Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (collectively IDRs) are found across all kingdoms of life and play critical roles in virtually every eukaryotic cellular process. In contrast to folded proteins, IDRs lack a stable 3D structure and are instead described in terms of a conformational ensemble, a collection of energetically accessible interconverting structures. This unique structural plasticity facilitates diverse molecular recognition and function; thus, a convenient way to view IDRs is through their ensembles. Here, we combine advances in physics-based force fields for IDPs with the power of modern multi-scale generative modeling to develop STARLING, an approach for the rapid and accurate prediction of IDR ensembles directly from sequence. STARLING enables ensembles of hundreds of conformers to be generated in seconds and works on GPUs and CPUs. This, in turn, dramatically lowers the barrier to the computational interrogation of IDR function through the lens of emergent biophysical properties complementing bioinformatic protein sequence analysis. We evaluate STARLINGs accuracy against extant experimental data and offer a series of vignettes illustrating how STARLING can enable rapid hypothesis generation for IDR function and aid the interpretation of experimental data."
"Artemisinin partial resistance (ArtR), mediated by Kelch13 (K13) gene mutations in Plasmodium falciparum, has caused delayed parasite clearance and, together with partner drug resistance, treatment failures in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs), located in southeastern Bangladesh and bordering Myanmar and India, regions with prevalent K13 mutations, account for approximately 90% of the countrys malaria infections but have not yet reported ArtR-causing K13 mutations. Importantly, however, some isolates from the CHTs have demonstrated moderate in vitro ArtR in the absence of K13 mutations. To assess the potential threat of K13-mediated ArtR in Bangladesh, we proactively evaluated the impact of three prevalent neighboring K13 mutations (F446I, R561H, and C580Y) on ArtR and parasite fitness in parasites isolated from the CHTs. We edited these mutations into two distinct genetic backgrounds: an artemisinin-sensitive strain (CHT-S) and a K13-independent, moderately resistant strain (CHT-R). In these edited lines, we then evaluated ArtR levels and fitness using ring-stage survival assays (RSA), post-drug treatment recovery assays, and competitive fitness assays against isogenic control strains. Prior to genome editing, both isolates were characterized for baseline drug susceptibility, resistance-associated mutations, and population structure. We found that C580Y and R561H mutations, but not F446I, confer increased in vitro ArtR in the CHT-R background already exhibiting K13-independent moderate resistance. All three mutations incurred minimal or no fitness costs in both genetic backgrounds. Notably, R561H, the dominant allele at the Thai-Myanmar border and currently expanding in Rwanda, mediates extreme resistance in the CHT-R background, with mean RSA survival rates of 30.9{+/-}1.9%, an unprecedented resistance level among K13-engineered lines. R561H also showed fitness advantages (0.5% per generation) and the highest growth recovery post-treatment. This represents the first experimental study modeling this K13 mediated ArtR risk in Bangladeshi parasites. In conclusion, we found that indigenous P. falciparum isolates in the CHTs possess inherent genetic potential to sustain high-level ArtR and fitness advantages if K13 mutations emerge, raising urgent concerns for containment and surveillance strategies during Bangladeshs malaria elimination phase."
"Many invasive species undergo a significant reduction in genetic diversity, i.e. a genetic bottleneck, in the early stages of invasion. However, this reduction does not necessarily prevent them from achieving considerable ecological success and becoming highly efficient colonizers. Here we investigated the purge hypothesis, which suggests that demographic bottlenecks may facilitate conditions (e.g., increased homozygosity and inbreeding) under which natural selection can purge deleterious mutations, thereby reducing genetic load. We used a transcriptome-based exome capture protocol to identify thousands of SNPs in coding regions of native and invasive populations of two highly successful invasive insect species, the western corn rootworm (Chrysomelidae: Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) and the harlequin ladybird (Coccinelidae: Harmonia axyridis). We categorized and polarized SNPs to investigate changes in genetic load between invasive populations and their sources. Our results differed between species. In D. virgifera virgifera, although there was a general reduction in genetic diversity in invasive populations, including that associated with genetic load, we found no clear evidence for purging of genetic load, except marginally for highly deleterious mutations in one European population. Conversely, in H. axyridis, the reduction in genetic diversity was minimal, and we detected signs of genetic load fixation in invasive populations. These findings provide new insights into the evolution of genetic load during invasions, but do not offer a definitive answer to the purge hypothesis. Future research should include larger genomic datasets and a broader range of invasive species to further elucidate these dynamics."
"Selection for antibiotic resistance has been demonstrated at low, environmentally-relevant antibiotic concentrations. Over the past decade, the concept of minimum selective concentrations (MSC) has been adopted in environmental regulation to define maximum permissible antibiotic concentrations. Such empirically determined MSC values often fail to reflect the complexity of natural communities, where susceptibility and resistance-associated fitness costs vary widely across species. To address this limitation, computational approaches have been developed to predict no-effect concentrations for selection of antibiotic resistance (PNECres) from routinely collected minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data. However, these approaches often lack a strong ecological basis, undermining confidence in their predictions.

Here, we propose a simple but biologically consistent framework to derive PNECres values by integrating MIC data with probabilistic estimates of resistance-related fitness costs. Our results suggest that current regulatory environmental threshold concentrations should be lowered by at least one order of magnitude to guard against selection for antibiotic resistance."
"Many protein domains harbour covalent intramolecular bonds that enhance their stability and resistance to thermal, mechanical and proteolytic insults. Intramolecular isopeptide bonds represent one such covalent interaction, yet their distribution across protein domains and organisms has been largely unexplored. Here, we sought to address this by employing a large-scale prediction of intramolecular isopeptide bonds in the AlphaFold database using the structural template-based software Isopeptor. Our findings reveal an extensive phyletic distribution in surface proteins resembling fibrillar adhesins and pilins. All identified intramolecular isopeptide bonds are found in two structurally distinct folds, CnaA-like or CnaB-like, from a relatively small set of related Pfam families, including ten novel families that we predict to contain intramolecular isopeptide bonds. One CnaA-like domain of unknown function, DUF11 (renamed here to ""CLIPPER"") is broadly distributed in cell-surface proteins from Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and archaea, and is structurally and biophysically characterised in this work. Using X-ray crystallography, we resolve a CLIPPER domain from a Gram-negative fibrillar adhesin that contains an intramolecular isopeptide bond and further demonstrate that it imparts thermostability and resistance to proteolysis. Our findings demonstrate the extensive distribution of intramolecular isopeptide bond-containing protein domains in nature, and structurally resolve the previously cryptic CLIPPER domain."
"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is hypothesized to relieve symptoms of depression by inhibiting activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). However, we have a limited understanding of how TMS influences neural activity in the sgACC, owing to its deep location within the brain. To better understand the mechanism of antidepressant response to TMS, we recruited two neurosurgical patients with indwelling electrodes and delivered TMS pulses to the DLPFC while simultaneously recording local field potentials from the sgACC. Spectral analysis revealed a decrease in high-frequency activity (HFA; 70-180 Hz) after each stimulation pulse, which was especially pronounced in the sgACC relative to other regions. TMS-evoked HFA power was generally anticorrelated between the DLPFC and sgACC, even while low-frequency phase locking between the two regions was enhanced. Together, these findings support the notion that TMS to the DLPFC can suppress neural firing in the sgACC, suggesting a possible mechanism by which this treatment regulates mood."
"Accurate and efficient autofocusing is essential for the automation of fluorescence microscopy, but background noise and shallow depth of field at high magnifications make autofocusing particularly challenging. Here, we present a fast and accurate autofocus algorithm to address these challenges. It is highly effective for high-magnification imaging, while performing equally well for low-magnification imaging tasks. The method is based on the mountain climbing search algorithm and yields improvements on autofocusing precision of up to 200-fold over current methods, whilst offering competitive speed and greatly extended search ranges. Our approach is broadly applicable: it demonstrated good stability and reproducibility across magnifications ranging from 20X to 100X, excels in both live cell imaging and high-resolution fixed sample imaging, and it is compatible with various microscopy techniques without the need for fiducial markers or hardware modifications on existing microscopes. To maximise its accessibility, we constructed a user-friendly interface compatible with the widely used Micromanager software. It generalises well across various imaging modalities and hardware platforms, making it particularly suitable for use in high-resolution screening of candidate drugs."
"This paper presents a rigorous proof that the Gaussian Network Model (GNM) with uniform spring constants maximizes entropy subject only to constraints imposed by the native contact topology. We demonstrate that this entropic optimality establishes the GNM as a fundamental thermodynamic reference state for protein dynamics, rather than merely a computational convenience. Our analysis shows that proteins, as soft matter systems, are predominantly governed by entropic considerations, with thermal fluctuations distributed among their degrees of freedom in a manner that maximizes configurational entropy. The uniform-spring constant GNM provides the least biased representation of protein dynamics, explaining its remarkable success in predicting experimental observables including NMR-measured correlations. We discuss how applying additional constraints to this maximum-entropy reference state, such as non-uniform spring constants or specific covariance requirements, inevitably reduces entropy while increasing Helmholtz free energy. This reference state framework offers new insights into allosteric mechanisms, drug binding effects, and the evolutionary balance between thermodynamic optimality and functional specialization in proteins. Previous approaches that constrained GNM fluctuations while maximizing entropy are contextualized within this theoretical foundation, highlighting pathways for model refinement while maintaining entropic principles."
"Sanfilippo B syndrome is a rare, inherited disorder of heparan sulfate catabolism. Cerebrospinal fluid heparan sulfate (HS) has been pursued as a biomarker for CNS disease. To determine whether CSF HS reflects disease in the brain, we generated a fusion protein of the NAGLU gene encoding alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (the enzyme deficient in Sanfilippo B) and the transmembrane region and cytosolic tail of LAMP1, which encodes the lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1, to tether the NAGLU enzyme to the membrane and prevent cross-correction. We used AAV7 to deliver the fusion construct intravenously to Sanfilippo B mice and showed that treatment of systemic bodily organs without treatment of brain did not result in reduction of CSF HS compared with untreated Sanfilippo B mice. Next, we used intracerebroventricular delivery of the construct in AAV9 under a synapsin-1 promotor to largely confine expression to brain neurons. We showed that treatment of the brain without treatment of systemic bodily organs resulted in reduction of HS in brain and CSF. These results support the utility of CSF HS as a therapeutic biomarker for Sanfilippo B and other disorders of heparan sulfate catabolism."
"Morphogenesis is controlled by signalling morphogens that form gradients across the embryo. The gradient formation requires that the low molecular weight morphogens slow down their diffusion by at least one order of magnitude. However, the precise slow-down of diffusion across the relevant micrometre scales has not been directly observed. Here, we develop and employ Single-Plane Illumination Microscope based spatial Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy (SPIM-sFCCS) to directly measure the diffusion coefficient of the morphogen Squint in early zebrafish embryos as a function of topography and length scale. We show that Squints diffusion coefficient changes on length scales that are commensurate with the diameter of the intercellular spaces in the embryo and that the slow-down is regulated by receptor binding. The slowdown can be reduced by either the knockdown of Activin receptor 2b, a receptor for Squint, or the overexpression of Lefty2, an inhibitor of Squint. Based on our results and supporting simulations, we propose an interstitial space-dependent transient receptor binding and diffusing mechanism to explain this slowdown, which is crucial for gradient formation and embryonic patterning."
"Image-based spatial transcriptomics deliver gene expression measurements of RNA transcripts in tissue slices with single-molecule resolution and spatial context preserved. Modern Graph Neural Network (GNN) models are promising methods for capturing the complex molecular and cellular phenotypes in tissues at single-transcript and single-cell levels. A key application of GNNs is the detection of spatial domains or niches, that is, groups of molecules and/or cells that collaboratively work together to produce complex phenotypes. Due to the vast number of detected transcripts in image-based spatial transcriptomics, applying GNNs on RNA molecule graphs is not trivial. We present a Python package, SpatialRNA, for easy (sub)graph generation from tissue samples and provide comprehensive tutorials for convenient and efficient application of Graph Neural Network models under the PyG framework. Availability and implementation: The SpatialRNA package is freely accessible from GitLab https://gitlab.svi.edu.au/biocellgen-public/spatialrna and can be installed via pip. Python notebooks and scripts used in case studies are freely accessible at https://gitlab.svi.edu.au/biocellgen-public/case_study_ipf and https://gitlab.svi.edu.au/biocellgen-public/case_study_xenium_5k_panel."
"The current study employed phylogenomic methods to examine the evolutionary role and significance of sleep-related genes in Sulfurimonas paralvinellae of the Epsilonproteobacteria class. This has facilitated the identification of conserved sleep orthologs, including DnaK, serine hydroxymethyltransferase, and potassium channel family proteins, exhibiting sequence similarities ranging from 39.13% to 61.45%. These findings align with prior research indicating that chaperones and ion channels are conserved during sleep. This was demonstrated by the observation that proteins with fewer domains exhibited more significant conservation than others, such as adenylate kinase, which is substantial under selective pressure. Distinct adaptations in bifunctional protein - serine/threonine kinases and phosphatases were linked to S. paralvinellae, an extremophilic organism adapted to high-pressure and/or high-temperature conditions, indicating functional divergence influenced by the organism's environment. The Gene Ontology study results indicated catalytic activity, potassium channel function, and cellular processes, underscoring the significance of ion channels in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. Furthermore, the categories not recognized as particularly significant for the over-represented genes encompassed metabolic and signal transduction categories, suggesting enhanced functional flexibility within this protein subfamily. The findings emphasize that orthologous interactions are complex and influenced by subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization of ecology and evolution. These findings enhance the existing understanding of the evolution of sleep-related genes and their association with metabolic and environmental changes, providing a foundation for subsequent experimental investigations and cross-taxonomic comparisons."
"Neurons encode information in a binary manner and process complex signals. However, predicting or generating diverse neural activity patterns remains challenging. In vitro and in vivo studies provide distinct advantages, yet no robust computational framework seamlessly integrates both data types.

We address this by applying the Transformer model, widely used in large-scale language models, to neural data. To handle binary data, we introduced Dice loss, enabling accurate cross-domain neural activity generation. Structural analysis revealed how Dice loss enhances learning and identified key brain regions facilitating high-precision data generation.

Our findings support the 3Rs principle in animal research, particularly Replacement, and establish a mathematical framework bridging animal experiments and human clinical studies. This work advances data-driven neuroscience and neural activity modeling, paving the way for more ethical and effective experimental methodologies."
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is still circulating among humans, leading to the continuous evolution. SARS-CoV-2 Omicron JN.1 evolved from a distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineage, BA.2.86, spread rapidly worldwide. It is unclear why BA.2.86 did not become dominant and was quickly replaced by JN.1, which possesses one amino acid substitution in the spike protein (S:L455S) and two in the non-spike proteins NSP6 and ORF7b (NSP6:R252K and ORF7b:F19L) compared to BA.2.86. Here, we utilized recombinant viruses to elucidate the impact of these mutations on the virological characteristics of JN.1. We found that the mutation in the spike attenuated viral replication, but the non-spike mutations enhanced replication, suggesting the mutations in the non-spike proteins compensate for the one in the spike to improve viral fitness, as the mutations in the spike contribute to further immune evasion. Our findings suggest that functional changes in both the spike and non-spike proteins are necessary in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to enable evasion of adaptive immunity within the human population while sustaining replication.

IMPORTANCEBecause the spike protein is strongly associated with certain virological properties of SARS-CoV-2, such as immune evasion and infectivity, most previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 variants have focused on spike protein mutations. However, the non-spike proteins also contribute to infectivity, as observed throughout the evolution of Omicron subvariants. In this study, we demonstrate a ""trade-off"" strategy in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron JN.1 in which the reduced infectivity caused by spike mutation is compensated by non-spike mutations. Our results provide insight into the evolutionary scenario of the emerging virus in the human population."
"To design safe, selective, and effective new therapies, there must be a deep understanding of the structure and function of the drug target. One of the most difficult problems to solve has been resolution of discrete conformational states of transmembrane ion channel proteins. An example is KV11.1 (hERG), comprising the primary cardiac repolarizing current, Ikr. hERG is a notorious drug anti-target against which all promising drugs are screened to determine potential for arrhythmia. Drug interactions with the hERG inactivated state are linked to elevated arrhythmia risk, and drugs may become trapped during channel closure. While prior studies have applied AlphaFold to predict alternative protein conformations, we show that the inclusion of carefully chosen structural templates can guide these predictions toward distinct functional states. This targeted modeling approach is validated through comparisons with experimental data, including proposed state-dependent structural features, drug interactions from molecular docking, and ion conduction properties from molecular dynamics simulations. Remarkably, AlphaFold not only predicts inactivation mechanisms of the hERG channel that prevent ion conduction but also uncovers novel molecular features explaining enhanced drug binding observed during inactivation, offering a deeper understanding of hERG channel function and pharmacology. Furthermore, leveraging AlphaFold-derived states enhances computational screening by significantly improving agreement with experimental drug affinities, an important advance for hERG as a key drug safety target where traditional single-state models miss critical state-dependent effects. By mapping protein residue interaction networks across closed, open, and inactivated states, we identified critical residues driving state transitions validated by prior mutagenesis studies. This innovative methodology sets a new benchmark for integrating deep learning-based protein structure prediction with experimental validation. It also offers a broadly applicable approach using AlphaFold to predict discrete protein conformations, reconcile disparate data, and uncover novel structure-function relationships, ultimately advancing drug safety screening and enabling the design of safer therapeutics."
"Transposable elements (TEs) are parasitic genomic elements that are ubiquitous across the tree of life and play a crucial role in genome evolution. Advances in long-read sequencing have allowed highly accurate TE detection, though at a higher cost than short-read sequencing. Recent studies using long reads have shown that existing short-read TE detection methods perform inadequately when applied to real data. In this study, we use a machine learning approach (called TEforest) to discover and genotype TE insertions and deletions with short-read data by using TEs detected from long-read genome assemblies as training data. Our method first uses a highly sensitive algorithm to discover potential TE insertion or deletion sites in the genome, extracting relevant features from short-read alignments. To discriminate between true and false TE insertions, we train a random forest model with a labeled ground-truth dataset for which we have calculated the same set of short-read features. We conduct a comprehensive benchmark of TEforest and traditional TE detection methods using real data, finding that TEforest identifies more true positives and fewer false positives across datasets with different read lengths and coverages, while also accurately inferring genotypes and the precise breakpoints of insertions.

By learning short-read signatures of TEs previously only discoverable using long reads, our approach bridges the gap between large-scale population genetic studies and the accuracy of long-read assemblies. This work provides a user-friendly tool to study the prevalence and phenotypic effects of TE insertions across the genome."
"Public liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and MS imaging metabolomics data repositories contain millions of files, with over 40% of them consisting solely of MS1 (full-scan) information, creating a significant gap in data reuse potential due to limited annotation capabilities. Here, we present ms1-id, an open-source Python package providing a unified solution for structural annotation of full-scan MS data applicable to both LC-MS and MS imaging analyses. Our approach leverages in-source fragments to generate pseudo MS/MS spectra through correlation analysis in either chromatographic or spatial domains. We introduce precursor-tolerant reverse spectral matching that accommodates multiple ion forms simultaneously and peak intensity scaling that enables matching of low-energy in-source fragments against existing reference MS/MS libraries. Applied to inflammatory bowel disease cohorts and diverse MS imaging samples, our method uncovers metabolites previously overlooked in traditional analyses. This strategy effectively addresses a critical need in metabolomics data reuse by enabling level 2/3 structural annotation of MS1-only data, facilitating new biological insights from existing repository data that was previously only annotated at the molecular formula level."
"As with human communication, recent studies have revealed that animals convey a substantial amount of information through their facial expressions. In these studies, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been increasingly employed to analyze animal facial image data. However, collecting large amounts of facial image data for such studies has been labor-intensive. In this study, we developed a system that automatically recognizes and saves the faces of freely moving mice using AI-based object detection and image classification technologies. Through validation experiments, we confirmed that the system can detect, classify, and save a variety of mouse profiles with high accuracy. To further expand the versatility of the system for diverse research applications, the technology has been improved to include a feature for determining mouse sex based on their profiles, leveraging AI algorithms for this purpose. A small dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the sex determination system, yielding 100% accuracy for both male and female classifications. This application enables researchers to efficiently collect facial image data, providing high-quality datasets suitable for AI training. Consequently, the efficiency of facial expression analysis in mice is significantly improved. Importantly, this technology is not limited to mice and has the potential to be applied to other animal species and a wide range of research fields, offering promising potential for diverse applications."
"Dicers (Dcrs) are central proteins involved in the biogenesis of small RNAs (sRNAs) in eukaryotes. Most of the knowledge on Dcr structure, function and evolution comes from studies conducted in animal and plant species. Comparatively, much less is known in fungi, which are a genetically and ecologically diverse group with important roles in ecosystems, agriculture, medicine, and biotechnology. While canonical Dcrs in plants and animals contain a well-defined domain architecture, most fungal Dcrs with experimentally validated functions lack one or more identifiable canonical domains, raising questions about how RNA-binding and precise sRNA processing is retained. Here, we conducted the most extensive survey of fungal Dcr proteins, analyzing 1,593 proteomes across eight phyla. We found a diversity of Dcr domain architectures, with some of them lacking an identifiable PAZ, Helicase, and/or double-stranded RNA binding domains. Phylogenetic analyses showed that different Dcr classes are distributed across distinct clades that often align with fungal taxonomic groups. Despite the lack of canonical domain architectures, we found that fungal Dcrs fold into a characteristic L-shaped structure and show PAZ-like folds, even in proteins without detectable PAZ sequences. Molecular docking and electrostatic analyses further indicate that these divergent Dcrs maintain key RNA-binding surfaces for proper sRNA processing. Our results indicate a remarkable evolutionary plasticity of Dcr in fungi, showing that essential sRNA processing functions can be retained through structural conservation, and highlighting fungi as models to study the modular evolution of the RNAi machinery in eukaryotes.

Significance statementDicer (Dcr) proteins are central to RNA interference (RNAi), a gene regulatory mechanism conserved across eukaryotes. However, current models of Dcr structure, function, and evolution are largely based on studies in animals and plants. Here, we present the most comprehensive analysis to date of Dcr proteins in fungi, a diverse eukaryotic group including many societally important pathogens and symbiotes which are reliant on RNAi. Our findings reveal that despite widespread divergence from canonical Dcr architecture, fungal Dcrs conserve critical folds and RNA-binding features, further suggesting that core RNAi functions are maintained. This work establishes fungi as key models for studying the evolution and functional robustness of the RNAi machinery, offering broader insight into the diversity and plasticity of sRNA biogenesis pathways across eukaryotes."
"Mollusks are a major component of animal biodiversity and play a critical role in ecosystems and global food security. The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea (Magallana) gigas, is the most farmed bivalve mollusk in the world and is becoming a model species for invertebrate biology. Despite the extensive research on hemocytes, the immune cells of bivalves, their characterization remains elusive. Here we were able to extensively characterize the diverse hemocytes and identified at least seven functionally distinct cell types and three hematopoietic lineages. A combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, quantitative cytology, cell sorting, functional assays and pseudo-time analyses was used to deliver a comprehensive view of the distinct hemocyte types. This integrative analysis enabled us to reconcile molecular and cellular data and identify distinct cell types performing specialized immune functions, such as phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, copper accumulation, and expression of antimicrobial peptides. This study emphasized the need for more in depth studies of cellular immunity in mollusks and non-model invertebrates and set the ground for further comparative immunology studies at the cellular level."
"BackgroundChronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 14% of the UK population and is associated with significant exercise intolerance, partly due to skeletal muscle dysfunction. While exercise is a potential therapeutic strategy, the molecular response of skeletal muscle to exercise in CKD remains poorly understood. This study aimed to characterise transcriptomic changes in skeletal muscle 24 hours after aerobic (AE) or combined aerobic and resistance exercise (CE) in non-dialysis CKD.

MethodsThis study utilised muscle biopsies from participants in the ExTRA CKD trial with stage 3b-4 CKDages 3b-4 (AE: 24 (15-32) ml/min/1.73m2; CE: 25 (19-31) ml/min/1.73m2). Participants (n=4 per group) were randomised to 12 weeks of thrice-weekly AE or CE. Vastus lateralis skeletal muscle biopsies were collected at baseline and 24h after the first bout of exercise. RNA was extracted for Bulk RNA sequencing. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between baseline and post-exercise samples, followed by pathway enrichment analysis.

ResultsFollowing AE, 1480 genes were upregulated and 1554 downregulated. CE resulted in 556 upregulated and 115 downregulated genes. The most upregulated gene after AE was CHI3L1 (log2FC 10.7), followed by SAA2 and PTX3, all associated with inflammation. After CE, SFN (log2FC 6.8) and MT1A were among the most highly upregulated. Enrichment analysis showed strong activation of inflammatory and cellular senescence pathways, and downregulation of mitochondrial function-related processes, particularly after AE.

ConclusionBoth AE and CE triggered robust inflammatory gene expression responses in CKD skeletal muscle, indicative of early repair processes. Unexpectedly, mitochondrial-related pathways were downregulated, aligning with previous findings of impaired mitochondrial adaptation in CKD. These results highlight mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential barrier to effective exercise adaptation and a possible therapeutic target in this population."
"Intein presence within Actinobacteriophages (within PhagesDB) was last surveyed in 2016, and despite a 5-fold increase in the size of the database, has not been updated since. To address this, we present a modern survey of the current iteration of the PhagesDB database. We developed a new algorithm - Iterative Cluster Expansion BLAST (ICE-BLAST) - to expand our search to more divergent sequences. Nearly 800 inteins were retrieved through this process; the majority of which were previously unreported. We describe the nature of these inteins, their classes, integration target sites, distribution within phage clusters, and explore the geographical location of nearly identical intein sequences found in divergent exteins. Our findings suggest that these inteins recently invaded local phage populations. We also find two instances of a Cas4 exonuclease intein evolving from a terminase intein, and propose a model by which one of these inteins was able to utilize sequence similarity conferred by a shared nucleotide binding site to jump between genes. Additionally, we find inteins with never-before reported homing endonucleases, and inteins with homing endonucleases encoded in a reading frame separate from that which encodes the extein and the intein's self-splicing domains. We provide predicted structures for these elements and hypothesize on their evolution and relation to free-standing homing endonucleases within phage genomes. Finally, we provide evidence that these ""non-canonical"" inteins are still transferring between host genomes, in a fashion similar to other inteins with canonical homing endonucleases within the dataset."
"Artificial neural networks commonly have deep hierarchical structures that were originally inspired by the neuroanatomical evidence of cortico-cortical connectivity pattern found in the mammalian brain. Largely neglected in those models are non-hierarchical aspects of brain architecture, namely the subcortical pathways and the interactions between cortical and subcortical areas regardless of their hierarchical locations. Inspired by this principle, we present a computational model combining cortical hierarchical processing with subcortical pathways based on neuroanatomical evidence. We show the versatility of our model by implementing the cortical hierarchy in two alternative ways--a convolutional feedforward network and a predictive coding network. Both model variants can replicate behavioral observations in humans and monkeys on a perceptual context-dependent decision-making task. The model also reveals that subcortical structures lead decisions for easy trials while the more complex hierarchical network is necessary for the harder trials. Our results suggest that the parallel cortico-subcortical processing explored in the model represents a fundamental property that cannot be neglected in understanding the computational principles used by the brain.

SignificanceArtificial intelligence and computational neuroscience models, particularly deep learning and predictive coding architectures, have been traditionally dominated by cortico-centric hierarchical frameworks. However, extensive neurobiological evidence suggests that cortical areas, regardless of their hierarchical classification, are deeply interconnected with subcortical structures in real brains. We propose here a computational framework demonstrating that parallel cortical-subcortical architectures can yield complex and more flexible computational capabilities, aligning with the observed behavior in the mammalian brain. Our model addresses key limitations in existing deep learning and predictive coding networks, offering a more biologically plausible and functionally advantageous alternative."
"The influence of confidence in assessing the perceived timing of sensory events on perceptual decision-making remains poorly understood. Metacognition--the ability to reflect on ones thought processes -- is often assessed through confidence ratings in perceptual tasks. However, accessing metacognitive information can influence task performance, a phenomenon known as the reactivity effect. This study examines metacognitive reactivity by examining the impact of confidence ratings on the temporal binding window (TBW) in two multisensory time perception tasks that use identical stimuli but require different judgments: Temporal Order Judgment (TOJ) and Simultaneity Judgment (SJ). Thirty-five participants (aged 18-39) completed TOJ and SJ tasks with and without confidence ratings via Prolific, an online participant recruitment platform. Psychometric functions were fitted to response and confidence data to determine TBW and the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS). Both tasks exhibited reactivity effects, with the effect being stronger in the SJ task. TBW significantly differed between TOJ and SJ tasks, regardless of confidence ratings. Additionally, TBWs from TOJ and SJ tasks were strongly correlated, as were the width parameters of confidence curves, suggesting shared underlying mechanisms in both perceptual and metacognitive processes. These findings highlight the utility of confidence ratings in evaluating TOJ and SJ performance, revealing both task differences and commonalities. We also discuss the potential for training interventions to enhance temporal perception, particularly in older adults. Finally, we reflect on the advantages and challenges of online data collection via Prolific, including its diverse participant pool and timing precision limitations."
"Regulation of gene expression is fundamental for proper cellular function, and is constrained by the local chromatin environment of each gene, which varies spatially along the chromosome and is shaped by epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic modifications induce changes in the local chromatin structure, which can influence gene expression, by affecting the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors. Such changes are particularly relevant in aging and genetic disorders like Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) and Werner Syndrome (WRN), where altered chromatin structure contributes to disease pathology. In this study, we analyze RNA-seq data using macroscopic metrics designed to be explicitly sensitive to chromatin modifications. The first metric, intra-chromosomal gene correlation length, measures spatial correlations in gene expressions along the chromosome. The second metric employs an energy landscape model based on the Arrhenius equation to estimate the energetic barriers associated with chromatin state transitions. We apply these metrics to various aging-related datasets, demonstrating their sensitivity to changes in the chromatin structure and the interpretability of the resulting outputs. The intra-chromosomal gene correlation length is particularly effective in quantifying changes in RNA-seq profiles due to increased chromatin accessibility during aging (and conversely, reduced accessibility due to treatment). This metric not only accurately distinguishes cell states, but also provides insight into the direction of aging. For instance, our observations on the effects of anti-sense oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment align with the existing literature, demonstrating that ASO partially restores chromatin structure in diseased cells. They additionally quantify the more pronounced effects in HGPS compared to WRN. The barrier energy landscape further extends this capability by offering a framework for understanding the progressive degradation of the regulatory mechanisms. Together, these metrics provide robust screening tools that enhance our ability to exploit common measurements such as RNA-seq to derive new phenotypes such as chromatin dynamics on aging and disease, offering an alternative perspective that complements traditional analytical techniques and enriches our understanding of cellular states."
"Remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is required for the proper healing, strengthening, and maintenance of tendon tissue. There are well documented sex differences in tendon injury rates and healing outcomes, often attributed to either innate differences in tissue structure and resident cell signaling or the influence of sex hormones. However, these factors are rarely decoupled. Estrogen (17{beta}-estradiol) and progesterone (P4) receptors are expressed in both male and female tendons and thus could participate in the remodeling process, but studies are extremely limited. Therefore, the objective of this work was to address whether biological sex differences are present in tendon remodeling and to determine the individual and combined roles of estrogen and progesterone in the remodeling process. We utilized an explant model of the flexor digitorum longus tendon harvested from young adult male and female mice to examine cell-mediated remodeling without disruption to the native environment. We found sex differences in tendon remodeling in the absence of hormonal stimulation, revealing how biological sex alone influences tendon health. We also demonstrate that the response to exogenous hormone delivery is sex-dependent, and that progesterone and estrogen serve complimentary yet independent roles. Overall, this work presents the first examination of sex-dependent matrix turnover in response to hormones and underscores the critical need for additional research in this area."
"BackgroundAlthough the benefits of machine learning (ML) are undeniable in health-care, explainability plays a vital role in improving transparency and understanding the most decisive and persuasive variables for prediction. The challenge is to identify explanations that make sense to the biomedical expert. This work proposes discernibility as a new approach to faithfully reflect human cognition, with the users perception of a relationship between explanations and data for a given variable.

MethodsA total of 50 participants (19 biomedical and 31 data scientists) evaluated their perception of the discernibility of explanations from both synthetic and human-based dataset (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). The inter-rater reliability was tested through the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). 13 statistical coefficients were considered to be able to capture for a given variable the relationship between its values and its explanations. A Passing-Bablok regression was performed for each user to highlight the consistency between user rating and each coefficient.

FindingsThe low inter-rater reliability of discernibility (ICC{inverted exclamation}0.5) with no difference between areas of expertise or level of education underlines the need for an objective metric of discernibility. Among all evaluated metrics, dcor metric was found to be the most suitable to capture the intra-individual reliability of discernibility perceived by users (median slope closer to 1 and a narrower confidence interval width for the Passing-Bablok regression with the lowest differential bias between the most and least discernible values).

Interpretationdcor was shown to be a reliable metric for assessing the discernibility of explanations, effectively capturing the clarity of the relationship between the data and their explanations, and providing clues to the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that are not immediately apparent when examining individual predictors. Discernibility can also serve as an evaluation metric for model quality, used to prevent overfitting or aid in feature selection, providing medical practitioners with more accurate and persuasive results."
"Neuronal bursts are distinct high-frequency firing patterns that are present ubiquitously throughout mammalian brain circuits. Although bursts are considered part of a universal neural code, the information they convey has long been a subject of debate. In this study, we investigated neuronal activity in simultaneously recorded regions of the thalamocortical system in freely moving mice as they learned stimulus-outcome associations in a go/no-go task. We discovered that, in parallel with learning, populations of neurons emerge in cortical, thalamic, and extrathalamic regions of the somatosensory system that encode task-relevant stimulus features via the presence or absence of bursts. These burst-coder neurons (BCNs) increase in number with task proficiency and exhibit burstiness that scales with stimulus valence rather than physical stimulus identity. Notably, BCNs consistently track stimulus-outcome associations--even after multiple rule switches--by inverting their burst encoding of the physical stimuli, indicating that burst coding is driven by outcome associations rather than by inherent stimulus properties. Although burst coding emerges throughout the thalamocortical system, only cortical units retain significant burst coding after devaluation, while other regions lose their discriminative burst patterns. Furthermore, decoding of stimulus properties and behavior achieves maximal accuracy when bursts or BCNs are used as input. Overall, these results provide direct experimental evidence linking neuronal bursting to learning, supporting a novel perspective of bursts as context encoders and teaching signals."
"Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) is a promising neuroimaging method that infers neural activity by detecting cerebral blood volume changes. It offers high sensitivity and spatial resolution relative to fMRI and is an epidural alternative to electrophysiology for medical and neuroscience applications, including brain-computer interfaces. However, current fUSI methods require hundreds of compounded images and ultrasound pulse emissions, leading to high computational costs, memory demands, and potential probe heating. We propose VARiable Sampling fUSI (VARS-fUSI), the first deep learning fUSI method to allow for different sampling durations and rates during training and inference by using neural operators. VARS-fUSI reconstructs high-quality fUSI images using 10 - 15% of the time or sampling rate needed per image while preserving decodable behavior-correlated signals. Additionally, VARS-fUSI offers efficient finetuning for generalization to new animals and humans. Demonstrated across mouse, monkey, and human data, VARS-fUSI achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing imaging efficiency by significantly reducing storage and processing needs."
"Experimental screening for biopharmaceutical developability properties typically relies on resource-intensive, and time-consuming assays such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC). This study highlights the potential of in silico models to accelerate the screening process by exploring sequence and structure-based machine learning techniques. Specifically, we compared surrogate models based on pre-computed features extracted from sequence and predicted structure with sequence-based approaches using protein language models (PLMs) like ESM-2. In addition to different end-to-end fine-tuning strategies for PLM, we have also investigated the integration of the structural information of the antibodies into the prediction pipeline through graph neural networks (GNN). We applied these different methods for predicting protein aggregation propensity using a dataset of approximately 1200 Immunoglobulin G (IgG1) molecules. Through this empirical evaluation, our study identifies the most effective in silico approach for predicting developability properties for SEC assays, thereby adding insights to existing screening efforts for accelerating the antibody development process."
"Predicting small-molecule partitioning into biomolecular condensates is key to developing drugs that selectively target aberrant condensates. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying small-molecule partitioning remain largely unknown. Here, we first exploit atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of model condensates to elucidate physicochemical rules governing small-molecule partitioning. We find that while hydrophobicity is a major determinant, solubility becomes a stronger regulator of partitioning in more polar condensates. Additionally, more polar condensates exhibit selectivity toward certain compounds, suggesting that condensate-specific therapeutics can be engineered. Building on these insights, we develop minimal models (MAPPS) for efficient prediction of small-molecule partitioning into biologically relevant condensates. We demonstrate that this approach reproduces atomistic partition co-efficients in both model systems and condensates composed of the low complexity domain (LCD) of FUS. Applying MAPPS to various LCD-based condensates shows that protein sequence can exert a selective pressure, thereby influencing small-molecule partitioning. Collectively, our findings reveal that partitioning is driven by both small-molecule-protein affinity and the complex interplay between the compounds and the condensate chemical environment."
"The white matter of the human brain exhibits highly ordered anisotropic structures of both axonal nerve fibers and cerebral vasculature. Separately, the anisotropic nature of white matter axons and white matter vasculature have been shown to cause an orientation dependence on various MRI contrasts used to study the structure and function of the brain; however, little is known of the relationship between axonal and vascular orientations. Thus, the aim of this study is to compare the orientation between nerve fibers and vasculature within the white matter. To do this, we use diffusion MRI and susceptibility weighted imaging acquired in the same healthy young adult volunteers and analyze the alignment between white matter fibers and blood vessels in different brain regions, and along different pathways, to determine the degree of alignment between these structures. We first describe vascular orientation throughout the brain and note several regions with consistent orientations across individuals. Next, we find that vasculature does not necessarily align with the dominant direction of white matter in many regions, but, due to the presence of crossing fiber populations, does align with at least some white matter within each MRI voxel. Even though the spatial patterns of blood vessels run in parallel to several white matter tracts, they do not do so along the entire pathway, nor for all pathways, suggesting that vasculature does not supply/drain blood in a tract-specific manner.

Overall, these findings suggest that the vascular architecture within the white matter is closely related to, but not the same as, the organization of neural pathways. This study contributes to a better understanding of the microstructural arrangement of the brain and may have implications for interpreting neuroimaging data in health and disease."
"Organic compounds with a negative nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC) are thermodynamically recalcitrant in anaerobic ecosystems, but few studies have measured the influence of NOSC on carbon degradation rates, gaseous product yields, or microbiome composition. We amended anaerobic rice paddy sediment microcosms with monomeric organic carbon compounds varying in NOSC. Consistent with thermodynamic and stoichiometric predictions, negative NOSC compounds are catabolized more slowly but produce more methane per mole of carbon. Negative NOSC microbiomes have higher alpha diversity, more syntrophs and methanogens, and fewer fermentative bacteria. Strikingly, fermentative bacterial taxa display genomically encoded NOSC catabolic preferences both in the lab and field. Negative NOSC- preferring fermenters have longer predicted doubling times, consistent with the thermodynamic recalcitrance of their preferred substrates. We propose that microbial NOSC preference can be leveraged for predicting and engineering greenhouse gas fluxes and understanding bacterial population dynamics and trait evolution across redox gradients."
"CXCL4 (PF4) is a chemokine stored in platelets that has pleiotropic effects across biological settings. These effects include driving of inflammation and fibrosis as well as reversal of the effects of ageing. We have recently demonstrated that CXCL4 function is driven, independently of known chemokine receptors, through binding to glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains on proteoglycans within the cell surface glycocalyx. In this study, we have used intravital imaging and radioactive tracer studies, in combination with an exogenous inhibitor and a GAG-binding CXCL4 mutant, to demonstrate that CXCL4 can enter the brain parenchyma of mice by binding to proteoglycans within the cell surface of the endothelial glycocalyx of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that CXCL4 directly promotes neurogenesis in vitro, which is mediated by its ability to oligomerise and bind to GAGs. These findings provide a molecular mechanism for CXCL4 uptake and function within the brain. Furthermore, these data have important implications for understanding CXCL4 during health and disease that may enable development of CXCL4-related therapeutics for inflammatory diseases and ageing."
"O_LIClimate change impacts arctic latitudes more acutely than other latitudes, resulting in arctic shrubification. How individual species in these climes respond to warming temperature is poorly understood. Understanding species resiliency to climate change will help us conserve plant species at risk.
C_LIO_LIWe performed a survey of plants in a permafrost anomaly in Resolute (Qausuittuq), Nunavut, Canada. Two identified species, Stellaria longipes Goldie and Cerastium regelii Ostenf., were investigated through modelled niche suitability under future climate scenarios, phenological analysis, and in vitro warming experiments to investigate growth and phytochemical profiles.
C_LIO_LI10 species including Stellaria longipes and Cerastium regelii were identified in the anomaly. Predicted niche suitability increased under SSP126 for C. regelii, with compressed and later flowering period since 1850. In vitro, S. longipes maximized growth at 24 {degrees}C with greater abundance of cytokinins than C. regelii, which increased growth at 28 {degrees}C.
C_LIO_LIStellaria longipes is self-limiting at higher temperatures, and is less temperature-dependent for its success, while C. regelii is more affected by warming temperatures, showing increases in growth and predicted niche suitability. Our work increases understanding of plant resiliency and vulnerability in Canadas High Arctic, and sheds light on the biology of an understudied arctic specialist in C. regelii.

"Advances in genome engineering and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) have revolutionized the ability to precisely map gene functions, yet scaling these techniques for large-scale genetic screens in animals remains challenging. We combined high-throughput gene disruption in zebrafish embryos via Multiplexed Intermixed CRISPR Droplets with phenotyping by multiplexed scRNAseq (MIC-Drop-seq). In one MIC-Drop-seq experiment, we intermixed and injected droplets targeting 50 transcriptional regulators into 1,000 zebrafish embryos, followed by pooled scRNAseq. Tissue-specific gene expression and cell abundance analysis of demultiplexed mutant cells recapitulated many known phenotypes, while also uncovering novel functions in brain and mesoderm development. We observed pervasive cell-extrinsic effects among these phenotypes, highlighting how whole-embryo sequencing captures complex developmental interactions. Thus, MIC-Drop-seq provides a powerful and scalable platform for mapping gene functions in vertebrate development with cellular resolution."
"Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are industrial microbial biopolymers offering a sustainable and biodegradable alternative to petroleum-based plastics. The PHA polymerization process is primarily mediated by PHA synthases (PhaCs), which determine the molecular and physical properties of the synthesized polymers. Previous reports have described Antarctic Pseudomonas isolates with unique PhaCs and capabilities for PHA production. However, the genes encoding PhaCs in Pseudomonas from Antarctica and other environments have not been investigated systematically. Here, we studied the diversity and phylogenetic distribution of phaC genes in 186 Pseudomonas species, including 33 isolates from Antarctica. Most species encode two class II PhaCs, with some displaying additional class II and class I enzymes, especially in Antarctic isolates. Different PhaC subclasses were proposed based on this diversity. Some phaC genes are in putative genomic islands, phages, plasmids, or close to insertion sequences, supporting their acquisition by multiple routes of horizontal gene transfer. Remarkably, the Antarctic strain P. frigusceleri MPC6 harbors five PhaCs, including one from a potential novel class. These findings underscore the unique attributes and potential use of Antarctic Pseudomonas for biopolymer production. Future research is essential to elucidate the enzymatic properties of this underexplored PhaC diversity.

Impact StatementA few Pseudomonas strains have been widely used to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), biopolymers constituting a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based plastics whose synthesis and properties primarily rely on PHA synthase enzymes (PhaCs). We showed that less-studied Pseudomonas species, especially from Antarctica, host a remarkable diversity of PhaCs, some likely acquired by horizontal transfer, including a potential novel class with yet-to-be-explored functional features and biotechnological potential."
"Bacterial plant pathogens exploit natural openings, such as pores or wounds, to enter the plant interior and cause disease. Plants guard these openings through defense mechanisms. However, bacteria from the genus Xanthomonas have specialized in that they enter their host via a special entry point, the hydathode--an organ at the leaf margin involved in xylem sap guttation. Hydathodes can mount an immune response against bacteria, including non-adapted and adapted pathogens like X. campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) that cause vascular disease. Previously, it was shown that the RKS1/ZAR1 immune complex confers vascular resistance against Xcc by recognizing XopAC activity, a type III effector (T3E). However, in absence of XopAC recognition, Arabidopsis Col-0 hydathodes still display resistance against Xcc. Here we mapped the causal gene using an inoculation method that promotes Xcc hydathode entry. Using a population of Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) of a cross between a susceptible (Oy-0) and resistant accession (Col-0), a major QTL for Xcc resistance was found on the right arm of Chromosome 5 in Col-0. Combining this result with a genome-wide association analysis yielded a single candidate gene encoding a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (CNL-type) immune receptor protein called SUPPRESSOR OF TOPP4 1 (SUT1). Expression of SUT1 was confirmed in hydathodes. We reveal that RKS1/ZAR1 and SUT1 confer different levels of Xcc resistance in different tissue types. Both RKS1/ZAR1 and SUT1 are alone sufficient for Xcc resistance in Col-0 hydathodes. However, RKS1/ZAR1 resistance is also effective in tissue types that represent late infection stages, i.e. xylem and mesophyll. In contrast, SUT1 resistance is not effective in the xylem, while weakly additive to RKS1/ZAR1 in the mesophyll. We thus identify a novel R gene, SUT1, that confers Xcc resistance primarily early in the infection during hydathode colonization.

Author summaryBlack rot disease, caused by the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc), is an economically important disease of cabbage crops. Xcc is unique in that it enters the plant interior through specialized organs at the leaf margin. These structures called hydathodes contain water pores and are involved in root pressure regulation. Although we know that hydathodes can mount an immune response against these bacteria, specific immune receptors still need to be discovered. Here we use the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to map an hydathode-effective resistance gene. By screening two different Arabidopsis populations, we could map a single gene, SUT1, that is involved in this resistance. SUT1 restricts the early hydathode colonization by Xcc thus suppressing disease progression. Interestingly, SUT1 resistance was not effective in the plant vascular system, which the bacteria subsequently colonize. Therefore, this study provides a new insight into the role of hydathodes in anti-bacterial resistance in plants and opens the door for research on tissue- and organ-specific resistance mechanisms."
"Human 1,4-galactosyltransferase (A4galt) is a glycosyltransferase existing in humans as two isoforms, widespread A4galt (named A4G) and its rare variant with p.Q211E substitution (A4Gmut). Both isoforms produce Gb3 (Gal1[-&gt;]4Gal{beta}1[-&gt;]4Glc-Cer) on glycosphingolipids and P1 glycotope (Gal1[-&gt;]4Gal{beta}1[-&gt;]4GlcNAc-R) on glycoproteins, which serve as receptors for Shiga toxin types 1 and 2 (Stx1 and Stx2). Stx1 is bound by Gb3 and P1 glycotope, while Stx2 is recognized solely by Gb3. To elucidate the role of these receptors, CHO-Lec2 cells expressing human A4G and A4Gmut were modified by disrupting the hamster B4GALT5 gene using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The B4GALT5 gene encodes {beta}1,4-galactosyltransferase 5 (B4galt5), synthesizing lactosylceramide, the key substrate for Gb3 synthesis. Consequently, B4GALT5-deficient CHO-Lec2-expressing A4G and A4Gmut cells lacked Gb3 glycosphingolipid but retained the ability to synthesize glycoprotein-based P1 glycotope. Both B4GALT5-deficient CHO-Lec2 cells expressing A4G and A4Gmut demonstrated no binding of Stx1B and Stx2B. The cytotoxicity assay showed that B4GALT5-deficient CHO-Lec2 cells expressing A4G were completely resistant to Stx1 holotoxin while A4Gmut-expressing cells revealed reduced sensitivity to Stx2. The glycoengineered CHO-Lec2 cells obtained in this study provide a valuable model for studying receptors for Stxs, enabling a detailed assessment of their roles in toxin binding and cytotoxicity."
"VPS13 is the founding member of a family of proteins that mediate lipid transfer at intracellular membrane contact sites by a bridge-like mechanism. Mammalian genomes comprise 4 VPS13 genes encoding proteins with distinct localizations and function. The gene duplication resulting in VPS13A and VPS13C is the most recent in evolution and, accordingly, these two proteins are the most similar to each other. However, they have distinct subcellular localizations and their loss of function mutations in humans are compatible with life but result in two different age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, chorea-acanthocytosis and Parkinsons disease, respectively. Thus, it remains unclear whether these two proteins have overlapping functions. Here, we show that while Vps13a KO and Vps13c KO mice are viable, embryonic development of Vps13a/Vps13c double knockout (DKO) mice is arrested at midgestation. Prior to death, DKO embryos were smaller than controls, were anemic and had a smaller liver, the key erythropoietic site at this developmental stage. Further analyses of erythroid precursor cells showed that their differentiation was impaired and that this defect was accompanied by activation of innate immunity as revealed by upregulation of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Additionally, the RIG-I and MDA5 components of dsRNA triggered innate immunity were found upregulated in the DKO fetal liver. Activation of innate immunity may result from loss of integrity of the membranes of intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria and autophagic lysosomes, due to the absence of these lipid transport proteins. The surprising and striking synthetic effect resulting for the combined loss of VPS13A and VPS13C suggests that despite of the different localization of these two proteins, the lipid fluxes that they mediate are partially redundant."
"Methods utilizing k-mers are widely used in bioinformatics, yet our understanding of their statistical properties under realistic mutation models remains incomplete. Previously, substitution-only mutation models have been considered to derive precise expectations and variances for mutated k-mers and intervals of mutated and nonmutated sequences. In this work, we consider a mutation model that uses insertions and deletions in addition to single-nucleotide substitutions. Within this framework, we derive closed-form k-mer-based-estimators for the three fundamental mutation parameters: substitution rate, deletion rate, and average insertion length. We provide statistics of k-mers under this model and theoretical guarantees via concentration inequalities, ensuring correctness under reasonable conditions. Empirical evaluations on simulated evolution of genomic sequences confirm our theoretical findings, demonstrating that accounting for indel signals allows for accurate estimation of mutation rates and improves upon the results obtained by considering a substitution-only model. An implementation of estimating the mutation parameters from a pair of FASTA files is available here: git-hub.com/mahmudhera/estimate_rates_using_mutation_model.git. The results presented in this manuscript can be reproduced using the code available here: github.com/mahmudhera/est_rates_experiments.git.

"Dendritic architecture plays a crucial role in shaping how neurons extract behaviorally relevant information from sensory inputs. Wide-field neurons in the superior colliculus integrate visual information from the retina to encode cues critical for visually guided orienting behaviors. However, the principles governing how these neurons filter their inputs to generate appropriate responses remain unclear. Using viral tracing, two-photon calcium imaging, and computational modeling, we show that wide-field neurons receive functionally diverse inputs from twelve retinal ganglion cell types, forming a layered, type-specific organization along their dendrites. This structured arrangement allows wide-field neurons to multiplex salient motion cues, selectively amplifying movement and suppressing static features. Computational models reveal that the spatial organization of dendrites and inputs enables the selective extraction of behaviorally relevant stimuli, including de novo computations. Our findings underscore the critical role of dendritic architecture in shaping sensory processing and neural circuit function."
DNA-Points Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (DNA-PAINT) enables multiplexed super-resolution imaging of biological samples. We expand the repertoire of speed-optimized DNA sequences for DNA-PAINT imaging to drive visualization of ten targets in a sequential manner with molecular resolution. We demonstrate this by visualizing diverse nuclear targets and characterizing their relative spatial distribution. We outline major reorganization in the chromatin landscape upon transcription inhibition. The ability to image as many as ten targets using this strategy at accelerated speed will drive its further adoption for diverse cellular imaging applications.
"Poly and per fluorinated substances (PFAS) are emerging contaminants of concern that are thought to be involved in causing numerous adverse health effects, such as immunosuppression, increased chance of cancer development, and altered levels of hepatic enzyme levels in humans. However, PFAS are considered highly persistent and resistant to biodegradation given the fact that the C-F bond can have a bond dissociation energy of up to 544 kJ/mol. Though many studies have reported PFAS biodefluorination by bacterial isolates and microbial communities, little is known regarding the molecular foundations for biodefluorination. In this study, we identified a novel defluorinase that is responsible for the biodefluorination of 6:2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (6:2 FTCA) in Rhodococcus sp. using the combination of transposome-based insertional mutagenesis and heterologous expression.

From a library of 41 Rhodococcus Sp. mutants, 3 individual mutants lost their ability for defluorination when they were exposed to 6:2 FTCA (mutant # 15, 32 and 38 - Supplementary table S-2). The disruption of the genetic locus in all 3 non-defluorinating mutants was identified coding for a putative MhPC superfamily protein. The MhPC superfamily of proteins is known to harbor other proteins such as fluoroacetate dehalogenase (UniProt - Q6NAM1) that are capable of -C-F bond cleavage. This identified gene was cloned into the heterologous expression host M. smegmatis MC2-155. After induction, the M. smegmatis MC2-155 transformant exhibited the ability to defluorinate 6:2 FTCA at a rate of 13 {micro}mol/h. In contrast, defluorination was not observed in either abiotic or biotic controls. Further characterization of the novel defluorinase indicated that it could moderately defluorinate the unsaturated PFAS compound 6:2 FTCUA (4.9 {micro}mol/h fluoride) and minimally defluorinate 5:2 sFTOH (1.3 {micro}mol/h fluoride). However, it showed no activity with 5:3 FTCA or sulfonated PFAS compounds such as 6:2 FTS and 8:2 FTS. The wild-type Rhodococcus could defluorinate 6:2 FTCA at a rate of 2.2 {micro}mol/h. The discovery of this MhPC class novel defluorinase in WT Rhodococcus Sp. has substantial value since it is responsible for the critical step that initiates defluorination of PFAS compounds such as 6:2 FTCA."
"Endosymbiotic gene transfer and import of host-encoded proteins are considered hallmarks of organelles necessary for stable integration of two cells. However, newer endosymbiotic models have challenged the origin and timing of such genetic integration during organellogenesis. Epithemia diatoms contain diazoplasts, obligate endosymbionts that are closely related to recently-described nitrogen-fixing organelles and share similar function as integral cell compartments. We report genomic analyses of two species which are highly divergent but share a common ancestor at the origin of the endosymbiosis. We found minimal evidence of genetic integration in E.clementina: nonfunctional diazoplast-to-nucleus DNA transfers and 6 host-encoded proteins of unknown function in the diazoplast proteome, far fewer than detected in other recently-acquired endosymbionts designated organelles. Epithemia diazoplasts are a valuable counterpoint to existing organellogenesis models, demonstrating that endosymbionts can function as integral compartments absent significant genetic integration. The minimal genetic integration makes diazoplasts valuable blueprints for bioengineering endosymbiotic compartments de novo."
"Infertility affects millions of couples worldwide, and in vitro fertilization is a key therapeutic strategy for achieving parenthood. Despite advances, the first IVF attempt fails in [~]60% of patients, highlighting the need for innovative solutions to improve clinical outcomes. Challenges include the limited ability to study embryo implantation, inadequate methods to test therapeutic drugs, and lack of metrics to evaluate implantation images. To address these issues, we developed ImplantoMetrics, a Fiji plugin for quantitative assessment of trophoblast invasion in combination with a 3D-in-vitro model. ImplantoMetrics uses Convolutional Neural Network and XGBoosting to accurately measure multidimensional expansion patterns. It allows quantitative evaluation of therapeutic interventions, and enables a complex study of trophoblast invasion. Compared to manual methods, ImplantoMetrics is [~]13-times faster and reduces errors through automation. Beyond implantation research, ImplantoMetrics offers a comprehensive tool to study spheroid invasion in different biological contexts, as e.g. demonstrated here for cancer research."
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, with a five-year survival rate of 65%. Oxaliplatin was the first platinum drug shown to improve CRC patient outcomes and is now a common adjuvant therapy for advanced disease, yet 90% of patients develop resistance. Oxaliplatin was developed as a third-generation derivative of cisplatin, but recent evidence points to divergent modes of action. Here, genome-wide CRISPR activation and knockout screens were conducted to identify genetic changes that confer resistance to oxaliplatin in two CRC cell lines with distinct molecular backgrounds (SW620 and RKO). Guide RNAs corresponding to the neutral amino acid transporter SLC43A1 (LAT3) were the most significantly enriched in knockout screens and depleted in activation screens, suggesting a potential role for LAT3 in modulating oxaliplatin resistance. In vitro CRISPR knockout and overexpression of LAT3 in SW620 and RKO cell lines confirm increased resistance or sensitivity to oxaliplatin, respectively. Further analysis demonstrates that increased LAT3 levels corrrelate with increased intracellular levels of oxaliplatin, increased levels of DNA-platinum adducts and DNA damage, demonstrating that enhanced LAT3-mediated uptake of oxaliplatin can exert its expected mechanism of action and induce cytotoxicity. These findings may lead to a better understanding of oxaliplatins mode of action in CRC and can provide new insights into the interplay between essential nutrient uptake and drug transport.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEOxaliplatin resistance remains a major clinical challenge for CRC treatment. Our study identified a novel role for LAT3 as a modulator of oxaliplatin sensitivity, offering new insights into drug resistance mechanisms."
"Voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channel -subunits are modulated by associated {beta}-subunits that affect their localization, trafficking and gating behaviour. The {beta}-subunits are members of the immunoglobulin (Ig) domain family of cell-adhesion molecules and the interactions between their extracellular Ig-domains may modify channel clustering. The full-length {beta}3-subunit can form cis trimers on the plasma membrane. The atomic resolution structure of a deglycosylated trimeric {beta}3-subunit Ig-domain has been solved by X-ray crystallography. However, it is not clear whether this particular trimeric Ig-domain structure is plausible for cell-expressed, glycosylated {beta}3-subunits. Here we use glycan profiling to confirm an extensive and heterogeneous pattern of {beta}3-subunit glycosylation, with the majority of glycans being bi- and tri-antennary structures with one or two terminal sialic acids. Two tryptic peptides of the {beta}3 Ig-domain are predicted to contain potential N-linked glycosylation sites. When the isolated, glycosylated full-length {beta}3-subunit was trypsin-digested and analysed by LC-MS/MS, only one of these peptides - containing an N-linked glycosylation site at residue N95 and located close to the trimer interface - was identified in its unmodified form, suggesting that residue N95 is under-glycosylated. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the glycosylated, membrane-bound full-length {beta}3 trimer confirmed that glycans can be accommodated with the Ig-domain trimer and indeed, may contribute to protein-membrane and inter-protomer interactions within the full-length, membrane-embedded trimer. Further biochemical studies are warranted to explore the interactions between oligomeric {beta}-subunits with corresponding -subunit sodium channels."
"Repetitive mild head injuries incurred while playing organized sports, during car accidents and falls, or in active military service are a major health problem. These head injuries induce cognitive, motor, and behavioral deficits that can last for months and even years with an increased risk of dementia, Parkinsons disease, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. There is no approved medical treatment for these types of head injuries. To this end, we tested the healing effects of the psychedelic psilocybin, as it is known to reduce neuroinflammation and enhance neuroplasticity. Using a model of mild repetitive head injury in adult female rats, we provide unprecedented data that psilocybin can reduce vasogenic edema, restore normal vascular reactivity and functional connectivity, reduce phosphorylated tau buildup, enhance levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor TrkB, and modulate lipid signaling molecules."
"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a key role in cell-cell communication by transporting bioactive molecules from donor to recipient cells across the body. While their involvement in somatic cells communication is well described, somatic-to-germ cells communication remains understudied. We show that small EVs (sEVs) can vehicle signals of early life stress (ELS) from circulation to sperm consequentially for the offspring. In mice, ELS persistently modifies RNA, lipids and metabolites in plasma sEVs. Chronic injection of plasma sEVs from ELS-exposed males alters the sperm transcriptome and is reflected in the transcriptome of embryos. This leads to metabolic dysfunctions in the adult offspring. These findings highlight a role of circulating sEVs in soma-to-germline communication relevant for the intergenerational transmission of ELS effects."
"In this study, we investigated the hemodynamic characteristics of arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) in murine models using micro-CT based computational fluid dynamics (CFD). By combining high-resolution micro-CT imaging with ultrasound flow measurements, our methodology offers a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional MRI-based approaches. CFD simulations performed at 7 and 21 days post-surgery revealed significant temporal changes in both geometry and hemodynamics. Geometric analysis showed that: the proximal artery diameter increased from 0.29 mm to 0.38 mm, while the initial 2 mm fistula segment showed a 21.6% decrease (0.74 mm to 0.58 mm). Blood flow through the AVF nearly doubled from 1.33 mL/min to 2.57 mL/min. Time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) peak values increased from 142 Pa (day 7) within the proximal artery to 200 Pa (day 21), in the stenotic region. The oscillatory shear index (OSI) showed marked elevation at the anastomosis (increasing from 0.22 to 0.48), indicating disturbed flow development. An inverse relationship between TAWSS and OSI was identified consistent with previous studies. Our methodology demonstrates the capability to analyze relationships between early hemodynamics and subsequent geometric changes. This approach could enable identification of regions susceptible to stenosis development and monitoring of AVF maturation, which could ultimately lead to quantitative metrics to evaluate surgical outcomes and early therapeutic interventions."
"We identified frequent inactivating notch1 mutations in HNSCC over a decade ago, indicating its role as a tumor suppressor--unlike its oncogenic function in leukemias and salivary gland tumors. However, there has been much debate in the literature regarding a possible oncogenic role in HNSCC as well, based on reports that notch1 signaling drives tumor growth and a cancer stem cell phenotype in some HNSCC tumor lines and patient samples. Clarifying whether NOTCH1 occasionally functions as an oncogenic driver in HNSCC is crucial to the prognosis and personalized therapy of patients with either wild-type or mutated NOTCH1. Here we present a systematic and comprehensive investigation unequivocally demonstrating that notch1 signaling functions as a tumor suppressor in HNSCC regardless of mutation or activation status and leads to reduction in frequency of cancer stem cells. We develop a robust gene expression signature of notch1 activation based on experimental data that when applied to patient samples shows notch1 signaling is associated with very early differentiation, an altered tumor microenvironment, and better prognosis-- consistent with a tumor suppressive role. Our work unifies the field by reconciling conflicting data and providing critical insights into the biological and clinical significance of the NOTCH1 pathway in HNSCC."
"Memory formation is necessary for the survival of animals across phyla. Here, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the formation of long-term associative memory (LTAM) formed by treating Caenorhabditis elegans with a volatile chemoattractant and heat. Previous work has shown that training animals with a paradigm involving heat and isoamyl alcohol (IAA) simultaneously, causes C. elegans to lose their attraction to IAA. In this study, we elaborate on the mechanism behind this LTAM formation and suggest that during training with heat and IAA, C. elegans release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that upon being taken up by the same trained animals or their untrained counterparts causes the organism to lose attraction to IAA. Our data suggests that the vesicles are highly specific to the training paradigms used and differ with differing cues. Finally, we show that this mechanism of transfer of LTAM appears to be conserved between C. elegans and C. briggsae allowing for both intra and interspecies transfer of memory."
"The study of binding kinetics via the analysis of fluorescence time traces is often con-founded by measurement noise and photophysics. Although photoblinking can be mitigated by using labels less likely to photoswitch, photobleaching generally cannot be eliminated. Current methods for measuring binding and unbinding rates are therefore limited by concurrent photobleaching events. Here, we propose a method to infer binding and unbinding rates alongside photobleaching rates using fluorescence intensity traces. Our approach is a two-stage process involving analyzing individual regions of interest (ROIs) with a Hidden Markov Model to infer the fluorescence intensity levels of each trace. We then use the inferred intensity level state trajectory from all ROIs to infer kinetic rates. Our method has several advantages, including the ability to analyze noisy traces, account for the presence of photobleaching events, and provide uncertainties associated with the inferred binding kinetics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our method through simulations and data from DNA origami binding experiments."
"Trypanosoma brucei, the causal agent of Human and Animal African trypanosomiasis proliferates in the extracellular milieu of mammals. It acquires host macromolecular nutrients, by receptor mediated endocytosis. The best characterised receptor is for transferrin (TfR) and it has been reported to be sequestered in the flagellar pocket, the sole site of endocytosis. In this location the TfR may be inaccessible to adaptive immune system effectors. The T. brucei genome encodes [~]15 TfR variants, and here we compared two, the first attached to the plasma membrane by a single glycosylphosphoinositol (GPI)-anchor and the other by two. Transferrin uptake kinetics were similar and rapid for both. Unexpectedly, initial binding of transferrin occurred over the whole cell surface suggesting the TfR was not sequestered in the flagellar pocket. This localisation was confirmed by immunofluorescence assays and was independent of the number of GPI-anchors. Two other GPI-anchored receptors were investigated to determine whether localisation to the whole cell surface was a general property of GPI-anchored receptors. Haptoglobin-haemoglobin uptake assays and immunofluorescence localisation of complement factor H receptor showed both were also whole cell surface localised. The mechanisms by which trypanosome receptors are protected from antibody-mediated attack are more subtle than hiding in a pocket."
"Small G protein ARL13B localizes to the cilium and plays essential roles in cilium biogenesis, organization, trafficking, and signaling. Here, we established multiple ARL13B knockout cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Surprisingly, all our cell lines lost their cilia completely, in contrast to the reported short cilium and reduced ciliogenesis phenotype. We found that multiple regions of ARL13B are necessary for a complete rescue. Additionally, we found that ARL13B knockout cells also lost their response to sonic hedgehog stimulation. Our work demonstrates the absolute requirement of ARL13B for ciliogenesis and sonic hedgehog signaling, at least in cultured cells, and suggest that ARL13B plays a far more critical role in ciliary function than previously understood."
"The fitness of a pathogen can be characterised at multiple levels corresponding to different stages of its life cycle, including replication within target cells (replicative capacity), immune evasion, and the capacity to infect new hosts (transmissibility). Pathogens evolve towards greater fitness within hosts, which can potentially compromise transmissibility. Typically, epidemiological studies for measuring pathogen fitness compute a single selection coefficient for pathogen variants that encompasses all stages of the pathogen life cycle. To address this problem, we develop a population-genetic model and software for the inference of multi-level selection coefficients which represent relative within-host fitness and transmissibility. Our approach builds on population genetic models previously applied to macro-evolution, whereby speciation and extinction rates are state-dependent. We relate the state-dependence in speciation and extinction rates to competing within- and between-host selection. Evolution of beneficial phenotypes within hosts may occur rapidly (higher  speciation), but reduce rates of dispersal between hosts (higher  extinction). This new coalescent-based method also accounts for highly nonlinear-population dynamics and variable sampling through time making it suitable for epidemiological studies. We derive the equilibrium proportion of a variant with multi-level selection under mutation-selection balance and show how this can be used in combination with the coalescent to greatly increase accuracy and precision of estimated selection coefficients. We characterise the accuracy of this method using a variety of birth-death and coalescent simulations before analysing a real dataset of HIV-1 genetic sequences from a large population-based sample of 4056 people living with HIV in Zambia. We quantified the multi-level relative fitness underlying HIV-1  co-receptor switching. In accordance with previous observations, we estimate that the relative transmissibility of X4-tropic virus is 9%, while within-host switching to X4-tropism is approximately seven-fold higher than switching to R5-tropism, indicating a strong within-host and between-host tradeoff of co-receptor usage. Our methods are available in an open-source R package musseco, providing a general-purpose tool for inferring multi-level selection coefficients for epidemiological sequence data.

Author SummaryThe fitness of a pathogen can be characterised at each stage of its life cycle. However, epidemiological studies measuring pathogen fitness typically estimate a single value encompassing the entire life cycle. Pathogens evolve towards greater fitness within hosts, but this can compromise the capacity to infect new hosts. Our new method quantifies relative fitness at both levels. This method accounts for rapidly changing pathogen populations and variable sampling through time making it suitable for epidemiological studies. We tested our method using simulations and demonstrate its application by analysing real HIV-1 genetic sequences from people living with HIV in Zambia. This method sheds new light on long-standing questions about the relative fitness of HIV-1 variants which utilise different host-cell co-receptors. Using our new method, we estimate that the capacity of X4 variants to infect new people is just 9% of that of R5 variants, while within-host switching from R5 to X4 usage is seven times greater than the reverse switch. This indicates a strong within-host and between-host trade-off in co-receptor usage."
"Tissue cartography extracts and cartographically projects surfaces from volumetric biological image data. This turns 3D-into 2D data which is much easier to visualize, analyze, and computationally process. Tissue cartography has proven particularly useful in developmental biology by taking advantage of the sheet-like organization of many biological tissues. However, existing software tools for tissue cartography are limited in the type of geometries they can handle and difficult for non-experts to use and extend. Here, we describe blender_tissue_cartography (btc), a tissue cartography add-on for the popular 3D creation software Blender. btc makes tissue cartography user-friendly via a graphical user interface and harnesses powerful algorithms from the computer graphics community for biological image analysis. The btc GUI enables interactive analysis and visualization without requiring any programming expertise, while an accompanying Python library allows expert users to create custom analysis pipelines. Both the add-on and the Python library are highly modular and fully documented, including interactive Jupyter Notebook tutorials. btc features a general-purpose pipeline for time-lapse data in which the user graphically defines a cartographic projection for a single key frame, which is propagated to all other frames via surface-to-surface alignment algorithms. The btc differential geometry module allows mathematically correcting for cartographic distortion, enabling faithful 3D measurements in 2D cartographic projections, including for vector fields like tissue flow fields. We demonstrate btc on diverse and complex tissue shapes from Drosophila, stem-cell-based organoids, Arabidopsis, and zebrafish."
"Tissue homeostasis relies on the stable maintenance of the stem cell pool throughout an organisms lifespan. Dedifferentiation, a process in which partially or terminally differentiated cells revert to a stem cell state, has been observed in a wide range of stem cell systems, and it has been implicated in the mechanisms for stem cell maintenance. Dedifferentiated stem cells are morphologically indistinguishable from original stem cells, making them challenging to identify. Therefore, whether dedifferentiated stem cells have any distinguishable characteristics compared with original stem cells is poorly understood. The Drosophila testis provides a well-established model to study dedifferentiation. While our previous live imaging analyses have identified dedifferentiation events constantly occurring at steady state, existing genetic marking methods fail to detect most of the dedifferentiated stem cells and thus significantly underestimate the frequency of dedifferentiation events. Here, we established a genetic tool with improved sensitivity and used live imaging and mathematical modeling to evaluate the system. Our findings indicate that the specificity of lineage-specific promoters is critical for successfully identifying dedifferentiated stem cells."
"Gene interaction networks specify how genes interact to produce an organisms phenotype. These networks are often incomplete due to absent or unobserved information. Predicting these missing links is critical for many applications, including genome-wide association studies and phenotype prediction. Efforts have previously applied graph neural networks (GNNs) to this missing-link prediction problem, but these techniques too have limitations when the sparsity of the networks is very high. Here, we apply a novel feature engineering technique that uses local graph motif incidence to enhance the feature set for variational graph autoencoders (VGAE). We compare the performance of our technique against state-of-the-art approaches, and then progressively hide more and more of the original graph edges. Our results show that VGAEs with our local-area motif prevalence (LAMP) features outperform state-of-the-art node embeddings for a wide range of missing edges on both a benchmark and a biological dataset. We also observe that this combined VGAE and LAMP technique has the potential to facilitate the search for novel genetic interactions in an experimental adaptive sampling context with far fewer samples. Improvements to gene interaction imputation can lower the barrier to new pharmaceutical and epidemiological discoveries by revealing hidden gene interactions that steer the development of potential drug targets."
"In humans, PHARC (polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and cataract) is an early onset autosomal recessive neurological disorder caused by deleterious mutations to ABHD12 (/{beta}-hydrolase domain protein # 12). Biochemically, ABHD12 functions as a lipase, and catalyzes the hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) (lyso-PS lipase). By doing so, it controls the concentrations and signaling pathways regulated by this potent signaling lysophospholipid in the mammalian brain. While genetic mapping efforts have identified over 30 mutations in ABHD12 from human PHARC subjects, the biochemical activity of these pathogenic mutants remains unknown. To understand this, here, we performed an exhaustive bioinformatics survey, and collated ABHD12 protein sequences from various organisms across evolution. Next, based on sequence alignments and structural modeling, we identified functionally relevant conserved residues in the ABHD12 protein sequence that are potentially important for its enzymatic activity. To validate these in silico findings, we generated numerous mutants of murine ABHD12, including those associated with human PHARC subjects, and assayed them for their enzymatic activity. Taken together, these complementary in silico and biochemical studies provide the first thorough sequence-function relationship for mammalian ABHD12, especially relevant in the context of PHARC. Finally, our evolutionary analysis identified CG15111 as an ABHD12 ortholog in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), and enzymatic assays indeed confirmed that recombinant CG15111 has robust lyso-PS lipase activity. Flies serve as an excellent animal system to model various human neurological diseases, and the identification of CG15111 as a Drosophila melanogaster ABHD12 ortholog opens new avenues to study PHARC in fly models."
"Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiome, affects approximately 29 percent of women worldwide (up to 50% in some regions) and is associated with several adverse health outcomes including preterm birth and increased incidence of sexually transmitted infection (STI). BV-associated bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella timonensis, damage the vaginal mucosa through the activity of sialidase enzymes that remodel the epithelial glycocalyx and degrade mucin glycoproteins. This damage creates an inflammatory environment which likely contributes to adverse health outcomes. However, whether BV-associated glycolytic enzymes also damage sperm during their transit through the reproductive tract has not yet been determined. Here, we show that sialidase-mediated glycocalyx remodeling of human sperm increases sperm susceptibility to damage within the female reproductive tract. In particular, we report that desialylated human sperm demonstrate increased susceptibility to complement lysis and agglutination, as well as decreased sperm transit through cervical mucus. Our results demonstrate a mechanism by which BV-associated sialidases may affect sperm survival and function and potentially contribute to adverse reproductive outcomes such as preterm birth and infertility."
"The roles of circulating complement C3, produced in hepatocytes, in immune defense are well defined in the literature. Interestingly, the C3 gene evolved before the circulatory system, suggesting an essential but yet unknown role of locally produced C3. Here, we investigated the effect of C3 on cancer immunotherapy and found that cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived C3, not hepatocyte-derived C3, determines the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Tumors developed in CAF-specific C3 knockout mice exhibited resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy, with increased immunosuppressive M2-like macrophage infiltration. Mechanistically, the C3 degradation product iC3b suppressed myeloid cell infiltration via complement receptor 3 signaling, and the therapeutic targeting of this pathway restored ICB sensitivity of immunotherapy-resistant tumors. In human cancers, stromal C3 expression correlates with reduced M2-like macrophage infiltration and improved immunotherapeutic outcomes. These data demonstrate the role of locally produced C3 in the innate immune response, which may have been conserved across many organisms."
"Biomechanical cues play an essential role in sculpting organ formation. Comprehending how cardiac cells perceive and respond to biomechanical forces is a biological process with significant medical implications that remains poorly understood. Here we show that biomechanical forces activate endocardial id2b (inhibitor of DNA binding 2b) expression, thereby promoting cardiac contractility and valve formation. Taking advantage of the unique strengths of zebrafish, particularly the viability of embryos lacking heartbeats, we systematically compared the transcriptomes of hearts with impaired contractility to those of control hearts. This comparison identified id2b as a gene sensitive to blood flow. By generating a knockin reporter line, our results unveiled the presence of id2b in the endocardium, and its expression is sensitive to both pharmacological and genetic perturbations of contraction. Furthermore, id2b loss-of-function resulted in progressive heart malformation and early lethality. Combining RNA-seq analysis, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and echocardiography, we discovered profound impairment in atrioventricular (AV) valve formation and defective excitation-contraction coupling in id2b mutants. Mechanistically, deletion of id2b reduced AV endocardial cell proliferation and led to a progressive increase in retrograde blood flow. In the myocardium, id2b directly interacted with the bHLH component tcf3b (transcription factor 3b) to restrict its activity. Inactivating id2b unleashed its inhibition on tcf3b, resulted in enhanced repressor activity of tcf3b, which subsequently suppressed the expression of nrg1 (neuregulin 1), an essential mitogen for heart development. Overall, our findings identify id2b as an endocardial cell-specific, biomechanical signaling-sensitive gene, which mediates intercellular communications between endocardium and myocardium to sculpt heart morphogenesis and function."
"Extinction learning - the suppression of a previously acquired fear response - is critical for adaptive behavior and core for understanding the etiology and treatment of anxiety disorders. Electrophysiological studies in rodents have revealed critical roles of theta (4-12Hz) oscillations in amygdala and hippocampus during both fear learning and extinction, and engram research has shown that extinction relies on the formation of novel, highly context-dependent memory traces that suppress the initial fear memories. Whether similar processes occur in humans and how they relate to previously described neural mechanisms of episodic memory formation and retrieval remains unknown. Intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings in epilepsy patients provide direct access to the deep brain structures of the fear and extinction network, while representational similarity analysis (RSA) allows characterizing the memory traces of specific cues and contexts. Here we combined these methods to show that amygdala theta oscillations during extinction learning signal safety rather than threat and that extinction memory traces are characterized by stable and context-specific neural representations that are coordinated across the extinction network. We further demonstrate that context specificity during extinction learning predicts the reoccurrence of fear memory traces during a subsequent test period, while reoccurrence of extinction memory traces predicts safety responses. Our results reveal the neurophysiological mechanisms and representational characteristics of context-dependent extinction learning in the human brain. In addition, they show that the mutual competition of fear and extinction memory traces provides a mechanistic basis for clinically important phenomena such as fear renewal and extinction retrieval."
"When an animal invests space, materials and energy in an eye to meet behavioural needs, the eyes optics and photoreceptor array compete for these resources to improve the eyes performance. To discover how this competition influences eye design, we introduce a new and superior measure of cost, specific volume in {micro}m3 sr-1, that depends on the dimensions of the eyes components, applies to both optics and photoreceptor array, accounts for space, materials and energy (including photoreceptors high metabolic rates), and links investments to an eyes performance via optical, physiological and geometrical constraints. Specific volume enables us to construct a performance surface across the morphospace of an eye of given type and total cost by modelling all of its configurations and determining each models information capacity. We model three eye types, neural superposition and fused-rhabdom apposition compound eyes and a simple (camera type) eye, across a 105-fold range of total cost. Performance surfaces are flat-topped, therefore the optimum configuration lies in a broad high-efficiency zone within which eyes adapted for specific tasks loose <5% of information. This robust region will increase adaptability by reducing loss of function. Comparing optimised models: simple eye information capacity increases as (total cost)0.8 and (total cost)0.55 in apposition eyesm and simple eyes are x10 to x100 more efficient than apposition eyes of the same total cost. In both eye types 30%-80% of total cost is invested in photoreceptor arrays, optimum photoreceptor length increases with total cost and is reduced by photoreceptor energy consumption. Simple eyes photoreceptors are much shorter than apposition eyes and their length more sensitive to energy consumption. We analyse published data that cover the same range of total specific volumes. The apposition eyes of fast-flying diurnal insects follow three trends predicted by our models: photoreceptor arrays are allocated 40% - 80% of total specific volume, spatial resolution and photoreceptor length increase with increasing specific volume, and apposition photoreceptors are much longer than simple. We conclude that photoreceptor costs are considerable and often exceed optical costs. Thus, competition between optics and photoreceptors for resources helps determine eye design, photoreceptor energy cost plays a major role in determining an eyes efficiency and design, and matching investments in optics and photoreceptors to improve efficiency is a design principle. Our new methodology can be developed to view the adaptive radiation of eyes through a cost-benefit lens."
"Ligands in the TGF{beta} family (activins, BMPs and TGF{beta}s), signal by bringing together two type I and two type II receptors. ALK2 is the only type I receptor among the seven TGF{beta} type I receptors that interacts with both activin and BMP ligands. With BMPs, ALK2 acts as a signaling receptor to activate SMAD1/5/8 signaling. Alternatively, with activins, such as Activin A (ActA), ALK2 forms nonsignaling complexes that negatively regulate ALK2 and ActA signaling. To gain insight into how ALK2 interacts with two distinct classes of ligands, we resolved the cryoelectron microscopy structure of ALK2 in complex with the type II receptor, ActRIIB, and the ligand, BMP6, in parallel with the corresponding structure with ALK3 for direct comparison. These structures demonstrate that ALK2 and ALK3 utilize different mechanisms to interact with BMP6 at the wrist interface, with ALK2 relying on BMP6 glycosylation and ALK3 relying on a salt bridge. Modeling of ALK2:ActA reveals that binding relies on ActAs fingertip region, mirroring the interaction of ActA with its other receptor, ALK4. Our results demonstrate that ALK2 is a  hybrid receptor that incorporates features of BMP type I receptors such as ALK3 at the wrist interface, and an activin type I receptor such as ALK4 at the fingertip.

SignificanceALK2 interacts with two different classes of TGF{beta} ligands: the BMPs and the activins. With BMP ligands, ALK2 signals to play roles in bone modeling, while with activins, ALK2 negatively regulates signaling by forming nonsignaling complexes. We demonstrate that ALK2 binds to favored ligand, BMP6, by utilizing the ligand wrist-helix stabilized by a glycosylation, rather than a charged interaction observed with similar receptor, ALK3. We also show that ALK2 interaction with activin ligand, ActA, is reliant on a single interaction at the other side of the receptor - the fingertip interface. Thus, this study elucidates first structure of ALK2 in complex with a ligand and provides the molecular insight into how ALK2 is able to bind to BMP and activin ligands."
"Electrical stimulation of nervous tissue is grounded in well-established biophysical principles, yet understanding its precise effect on neural activity remains challenging. This represents a major obstacle to both scientific and clinical applications of electrical brain stimulation.

We here show that the reciprocity theorem of electromagnetism can be applied more broadly than previously acknowledged, providing a framework for elucidating the effects of electrical brain stimulation on neurons. Through this new perspective, we account for the observed weak frequency-dependence of extracellular electrical stimulation-induced membrane potential changes, and demonstrate a 1/r falloff for nearby and 1/r2 falloff for distant neurons.

We also show that for transcranial electrical stimulation, the susceptibility of a neuron to the stimulation is directly proportional to the size of the current dipole moment resulting from somatic current input. The induced somatic membrane potential changes are small and exhibit weak spatial but strong orientation dependency across human neocortex.

The reciprocity-based approach to electrical stimulation reproduces a large body of previous experimental data, and provides new insights into how ES affects neurons."
"The neuromodulator dopamine is integral to feeding behavior, believed to modulate food pursuit and satiety. Here, we examine how dopamine and spiny projection neurons (SPNs) signaling in the nucleus accumbens changes during consumption as animals transition from hunger to satiety in naturalistic feeding. Both dopamine and SPNs transiently increase during food approach; however, the magnitude of this approach-related increase diminishes across progressive pellet ingestion, reflecting short-term satiation. Fasting dissociates the regulation of meal size and frequency-- termination and initiation, respectively-- with altered dopamine corresponding to changes in meal size but not frequency. Despite substantially decreasing feeding, pharmacological satiation via a glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) agonist had no impact on dopamine signaling, suggesting that the GLP-1 agonist disengaged or decoupled dopamine from its modulatory role in food seeking."
"External forces shape navigation, but cannot be directly measured by an animal in motion. How the brain integrates multi-modal cues to estimate external forces remains unclear. Here we investigated the representation of multi-modal self-motion cues across columnar inputs to the fly navigation center, known as PFNs. We find that one type integrates optic flow and airflow direction signals with distinct dynamics. We reveal airspeed encoding by a different type. Based on these data, we construct and validate models of how multi-sensory dynamics are encoded across PFNs, allowing us to simulate neural responses during rapid flight maneuvers. Applying a nonlinear observability analysis to these responses, we show that PFN representations during active maneuvers are sufficient to decode the direction of an external force (wind) during free flight. Our work provides evidence that active sensation, combined with multisensory encoding, can allow a compact nervous system to infer a property of the external world that cannot be directly measured by a single sensory system."
"Human macrophages (M{Phi}s) reside in tissues and develop tissue-specific identities. While studies in mice have identified molecular signatures for site-specific M{Phi} differentiation, we know less about the transcriptional profiles of human M{Phi}s in distinct sites, including mucosal tissues and lymphoid organs during homeostasis and activation. Here, we use multimodal single-cell sequencing and ex vivo stimulation assays to define tissue signatures for populations of human M{Phi}s isolated from lungs, small intestine, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes obtained from individual organ donors. Our results reveal distinct tissue-adapted gene and protein profiles of metabolic, adhesion, and immune interaction pathways, which are specific to M{Phi}s and not monocytes isolated from the same sites. These signatures exhibit homology to murine M{Phi}s from the same sites. Tissue-adapted M{Phi}s remained responsive to polarizing cytokine stimuli ex vivo, with upregulation of expected transcripts and secreted proteins, while retaining tissue-specific profiles. Together, our findings show how human M{Phi} identity is coupled to their site of residence for mucosal and lymphoid organs and is intrinsically maintained during activation and polarization."
"Light scattering in biological tissue presents a significant challenge for deep in vivo imaging. Our previous work demonstrated the ability to achieve optical transparency in live mice using intensely absorbing dye molecules, which created transparency in the red spectrum while blocking shorter-wavelength photons. In this paper, we extend this capability to achieve optical transparency across the entire visible spectrum by employing molecules with strong absorption in the ultraviolet spectrum and sharp absorption edges that rapidly decline upon entering the visible spectrum. This new color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency method enables optical transparency for imaging commonly used fluorophores in the green and yellow spectra. Notably, this approach facilitates tissue transparency for structural and functional imaging of the live mouse brain labeled with yellow fluorescent protein and GCaMP through the scalp and skull. We show that this method enables longitudinal imaging of the same brain regions in awake mice over multiple days during development. Histological analyses of the skin and systemic toxicology studies indicate minimal acute or chronic damage to the skin or body using this approach. This color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency technique opens new opportunities for noninvasive deep-tissue optical imaging, enabling long-term visualization of cellular structures and dynamic activity with high spatiotemporal resolution and chronic tracking capabilities.

Significance StatementTissue scattering represents a major barrier to deep tissue imaging in vivo. We recently showed that tissue can be rendered transparent in the red spectrum using intensely absorbing dye molecules. Here, we introduce a new, color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency approach. We demonstrate longitudinal structural and functional imaging in the deep tissue of awake mice."
"The last few years have seen an explosion in the number of tools available to measure neuronal activity using fluorescence imaging (Chen et al., 2013; Feng et al., 2019; Jing et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2018; Wan et al., 2021). When performed in vivo, these measurements are invariably contaminated by hemodynamic occlusion artifacts. In widefield calcium imaging, this problem is well recognized. For two-photon imaging, however, the effects of hemodynamic occlusion have only been sparsely characterized. Here we perform a quantification of hemodynamic occlusion effects using measurements of fluorescence changes observed with GFP expression using both widefield and two-photon imaging. We find that in many instances the magnitude of signal changes attributable to hemodynamic occlusion is comparable to that observed with activity sensors. Moreover, we find that hemodynamic occlusion effects were spatially heterogeneous, both over cortical regions and across cortical depth, and exhibited a complex relationship with behavior. Thus, hemodynamic occlusion is an important caveat to consider when analyzing and interpreting not just widefield but also two-photon imaging data."
"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a multifactorial condition influenced by the gut microbiome (GM). While previous studies have reported inconsistent associations between MASLD and key microbial clades using low-resolution 16S rRNA profiling, we employed high-resolution metagenomic sequencing and multi-marker taxonomic classification across three independent cohorts to identify robust microbial and functional signatures of MASLD. We consistently detected a depletion of Agathobacter rectalis, a known butyrate producer, in MASLD patients. Functionally, MASLD was characterized by a depletion of genes involved in butyrate and methane biosynthesis-particularly within the crotonyl-butyryl-CoA axis-alongside an enrichment of genes driving the production of endogenous alcohols such as ethanol and 1-propanol. Genes encoding these fermentative pathways, often organized in operons like pdu and tor, were more abundant in MASLD samples, indicating a potential shift toward alcohol-producing metabolism. These geno-metabolic changes were accompanied by a broader displacement of beneficial taxa and an increase in accessory gene content across the GM, underscoring the limitations of taxonomy-based disease associations. Many of the differentially abundant genes were also found on plasmids, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer contributes to strain-level metabolic variability relevant to MASLD progression. Our findings support a model in which GM-driven metabolic shifts-rather than taxonomic changes alone-play a central role in MASLD pathogenesis, highlighting the importance of functional and mobile genetic element (MGEs) profiling for uncovering mechanistic links between the microbiome and liver disease."
"The degenerative loss of muscle associated with aging leading to muscular atrophy is called sarcopenia. Currently, practicing regular physical exercise is the only efficient way to delay sarcopenia onset. Identification of therapeutic targets to alleviate the symptoms of aging requires in vivo model organisms of accelerated muscle degeneration and atrophy. The zebrafish undergoes aging, with hallmarks including mitochondrial dysfunction, telomere shortening, and accumulation of senescent cells. However, zebrafish age slowly, and no specific zebrafish models of accelerated muscle atrophy associated with molecular events of aging are currently available. We have developed a new genetic tool to efficiently accelerate muscle-fiber degeneration and muscle-tissue atrophy in zebrafish larvae and adults. We used a gain-of-function strategy with a molecule that has been shown to be necessary and sufficient to induce muscle atrophy and a sarcopenia phenotype in mammals: Atrogin-1 (also named Fbxo32). We report the generation, validation, and characterization of a zebrafish genetic model of accelerated neuromuscular atrophy, the atrofish. We demonstrated that Atrogin-1 expression specifically in skeletal muscle tissue induces a muscle atrophic phenotype associated with locomotion dysfunction in both larvae and adult fish. We identified degradation of the myosin light chain as an event occurring prior to muscle-fiber degeneration. Biological processes associated with muscle aging such as proteolysis, inflammation, stress response, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and apoptosis are upregulated in the atrofish. Surprisingly, we observed a strong correlation between muscle-fiber degeneration and reduced numbers of neuromuscular junctions in the peripheral nervous system, as well as neuronal cell bodies in the spinal cord, suggesting that muscle atrophy could underly a neurodegenerative phenotype in the central nervous system. Finally, while atrofish larvae can recover locomotive functions, adult atrofish have impaired regenerative capacities, as is observed in mammals during muscle aging. In the future, the atrofish could serve as a platform for testing molecules aimed at treating or alleviating the symptoms of muscle aging, thereby opening new therapeutic avenues in the fight against sarcopenia."
"Aneuploidy is observed as gains or losses of whole chromosomes or chromosome arms and is a common hallmark of cancer. Whereas models for the generation of aneuploidy in cancer invoke mitotic chromosome segregation errors, whole-arm losses might occur simply as a result of centromere breakage. We recently showed that elevated RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) level over S-phase-dependent histone genes predicts rapid recurrence of human meningioma and is correlated with total whole-arm losses relative to gains. To explain this imbalance in arm losses over gains, we have proposed that histone overexpression at S-phase competes with the histone H3 variant CENP-A, resulting in centromere breaks and whole-arm losses. To test whether centromere breaks alone can drive aneuploidy, we ask whether total whole-arm aneuploids can predict outcome across different cancer types in large RNA and whole-genome sequencing databanks. We find that total whole-arm losses generally predict outcome, suggesting that centromere breakage is a major initiating factor leading to aneuploidy and the resulting changes in the selective landscape that drive most cancers. We also present evidence that centromere breakage alone is sufficient to account for whole-arm losses and gains, contrary to mitotic spindle error models for generation of aneuploidy. Our results suggest that therapeutic intervention targeting histone overexpression has the potential of reducing aneuploidy and slowing cancer progression.

Significance StatementGain or loss of whole chromosome arms following centromere breaks is frequent in cancer, but whether or not there is a common initiating event is unknown. Here we show that the total number of whole-arm losses predicts patient outcomes across cancer types, suggesting a causal relationship. This general excess of losses over gains is not predicted by mitotic error models of aneuploidy but rather suggests that centromere breaks themselves initiate whole-arm aneuploidies. Insofar as aneuploidy reshapes the selective landscapes that drive most cancers, our results have potential clinical implications."
"Species throughout the tree of life have evolved to produce multiple public goods, and they often exhibit division of labor, meaning that subpopulations have different allocations of effort across the goods. Despite a robust theoretical literature on mechanisms that lead to division of labor in specific domains, a general evolutionary game-theoretical analysis remains incomplete. Here we model labor as a continuous quantity and the resulting public goods as functions of labor contributed by all individuals using adaptive dynamics. We derive general conditions for the evolution of division of labor and categorize what forms of division may arise. We show that the adaptive dynamics of division of labor has three potential outcomes that differ in expected payoff and variance in payoff. Our findings indicate that the evolution of division of labor can have a diverse range of possible outcomes, with important consequences for fitness, variance in payoff, and the distribution of effort across the population."
"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a problematic pathogen with complex antibiotic resistance patterns. In clinical practice, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests typically focus on a limited subset of antibiotics, hindering a comprehensive assessment of a strains resistance profile. Here, we introduce MICFiller, a Denoising AutoEncoder (DAE) model designed to impute missing MIC values for 14 antibiotics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa within a specific dilution range by leveraging known MIC measurements for other antibiotics in the same strain. We evaluated the performance of DAE against two other commonly used methods: Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) and simple median imputation. The DAE achieved the highest balanced 1-tier accuracy for most antibiotics, with performance closely matching that of MICE. MICFiller is freely accessible through a user-friendly web interface at http://iorgalab.org:4567/micfiller, offering clinicians a more complete view of a strains antibiotic resistance profile."
"ObjectiveStatistical models are powerful tools for describing biological phenomena such as neuronal spiking activity. Although these models have been widely used to study spontaneous and stimulated neuronal activity, they have not yet been applied to analyze responses to electrical cortical stimulation. In this study, we present an innovative approach to characterize neuronal responses to electrical stimulation in the mouse cortex, providing detailed insights into cortical-thalamic dynamics.

ApproachOur method applies Mixture Models to analyze the Peri-Stimulus Time Histogram of each neuron, predicting the probability of spiking at specific latencies following the onset of electrical stimuli. By applying this approach, we investigated neuronal responses to cortical stimulation recorded from the motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, and sensorimotor-related thalamic nuclei in the mouse brain.

Main resultsThe characterization approach achieved high goodness of fit, and the model features were leveraged by applying machine learning methods for stimulus intensity decoding and classification of brain regions to which a neuron belongs given its response to the stimulus. The Random Forest model demonstrated the highest F1 scores, achieving 92.86% for stimulus intensity decoding and 84.35% for brain zone classification.

SignificanceThis study presents a novel statistical framework for characterizing neuronal responses to electrical cortical stimulation, providing quantitative insights into cortical-thalamic dynamics. Our approach achieves high accuracy in stimulus decoding and brain region classification, providing valuable contributions for neuroscience research and neuro-technology applications."
"Spatial cellular context is crucial in shaping intratumor heterogeneity. However, understanding how each tumor establishes its unique spatial landscape and what factors drive the landscape for tumor fitness remains significantly challenging. Here, we analyzed over 2 million cells from 50 tumor biospecimens using spatial single-cell imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing. We developed a deep learning-based strategy to spatially map tumor cell states and the architecture surrounding them, which we referred to as Spatial Dynamics Network (SDN). We found that different tumor cell states may be organized into distinct clusters, or  villages, each supported by unique SDNs. Notably, tumor cell villages exhibited village-specific molecular co-dependencies between tumor cells and their microenvironment and were associated with patient outcomes. Perturbation of molecular co-dependencies via random spatial shuffling of the microenvironment resulted in destabilization of the corresponding villages. This study provides new insights into understanding tumor spatial landscape and its impact on tumor aggressiveness."
"O_LILichens are symbiotic assemblies consisting of multiple organisms, chiefly a fungus and a photosynthetic microorganism or the photobiont. Among diverse photobionts, the most prevalent is the chlorophyte alga Trebouxia.
C_LIO_LIWe produced a chromosome-level assembly of Trebouxia sp.  A48, a photobiont of Xanthoria parietina. The genome was assembled into 20 contigs, of which 16 had telomeric repeats on both ends and likely represent complete chromosomes. We compared the genome to genomes of other Trebouxia species and analyzed it to investigate the biology of the species, including its lifecycle and adaptations to lichen lifestyle.
C_LIO_LITrebouxia sp.  A48 genome is haploid and encodes genes involved in sexual reproduction and meiosis. The predicted secretome is enriched in hydrolases and redox enzymes and contains carbohydrate-binding proteins potentially involved in cell-to-cell recognition and adhesion. We identified genes potentially involved in carbon concentrating and confirmed two instances of ancient horizontal gene transfer from fungi.
C_LIO_LIThe genome and the strain of Trebouxia sp.  A48 are available for the community for research on algal evolution and lichen symbiosis.

"Ageing is characterised by persistent low-grade inflammation that is linked to impaired tissue homeostasis and functionality. However, the molecular mechanisms driving age-associated inflammation remain poorly understood. The mammalian skin is a clinically relevant target of age-driven inflammation associated with compromised barrier function, inefficient wound healing, elevated oxidative stress, and DNA damage accumulation. Here, we show that upon ageing a previously uncharacterised BMAL1-YAP transcriptional complex is hijacked from chromatin regions associated with homeostatic genes in adult epidermis and redirected to inflammation-related enhancers, amplifying the transcription of their target genes. Independently of its known role as a core circadian clock component, BMAL1 partners with the mechanosensitive transcriptional cofactor YAP at enhancer regions to regulate epidermal identity genes. In contrast, in aged skin, BMAL1-YAP complexes bind to enhancers of inflammation-related genes, co-regulated by NF-KB. Interestingly, aged pro-inflammatory signals from the IL-17 pathway activate YAP in a Hippo-independent manner. These findings unveil a transcriptional mechanism underlying epidermal ageing, linking chromatin dynamics to inflammatory transcriptional programs through BMAL1-YAP-bound enhancer rewiring. By elucidating how ageing reprograms transcriptional networks, our work highlights potential strategies to counteract chronic inflammation and restore tissue homeostasis across age-related loss of functionality."
"Evolution of the mandibular structure has played a key role in the taxonomic diversification and niche exploration of tetrapods, from the initial water-to-land transition to the origin and radiation of mammals. While jaw evolution through these key transition points have long attracted attention, no studies of jaw evolution to date capture the breadth of tetrapod diversity and evolutionary history. Here, we reconstruct the compositional evolution of the tetrapod mandible with a comprehensive dataset of 36 traits scored in 3047 species. This sampling spans the earliest eotetrapodiforms to extant amphibians, mammals, and reptiles and birds, capturing immense ecological, developmental, and taxonomic diversity among a near-even split of extant and fossil tetrapods. We find that lower jaw morphology rapidly canalises at the base of each major clade, including, Eotetrapodiformes, Amniota, Synapsida, Sauropsida, and Amphibia, as well as subclades within those groups, and that, as a result, jaw compositional variation is highly phylogenetically structured. We estimate an average of over 100 shifts in three key traits: number of elements (dermal and endochondral bones), number of tooth-bearing elements, and total teeth per hemimandible, with symmetrical rates of gains and losses estimated for the number of elements, and correlated evolution between these three characters. Although novel elements arise occasionally, disparity in jaw composition overwhelmingly decreases as clades canalise rapidly, successively, and pervasively through tetrapod evolutionary history."
"Neural tube closure is a critical morphogenetic process in vertebrate development, and failure to close cranial regions such as the hindbrain neuropore (HNP) leads to severe congenital malformations. While mechanical forces like actomyosin purse-string contraction and directional cell crawling have been implicated in driving HNP closure, how these forces organize local cell shape and motion to produce large-scale tissue remodeling remains poorly understood. Using live and fixed imaging of mouse embryos combined with cell-based biophysical modeling, we show that these force-generating mechanisms are insufficient to explain the robust patterns of cell elongation and nematic alignment observed at the HNP border. Instead, we show that local anisotropic stress and cytoskeletal organization are required to generate these patterns and promote midline cell motion. Our model captures key features of cell shape dynamics and emergent nematic order, which we confirm experimentally, including the alignment of actin fibers with cell shape and enhanced midline cell speed. Comparative analysis with chick embryos, which lack supracellular purse-strings, supports a conserved link between tension generation and cellular patterning. These findings establish a physical framework connecting force generation, cell shape anisotropy, and tissue morphodynamics during epithelial gap closure."
"Prokaryotes have evolved various mechanisms to counter viruses, which in their turn developed numerous strategies to avoid defenses of the hosts. Dozens of such defense and counter-defense mechanisms have recently been discovered, yet the number of such systems held by a given virus or its host is limited. Here, we present numerical and theoretical arguments for the existence of the maximal number of ecologically and evolutionary sustainable defense and counter-defense systems maintained by both sides at any time of the never-ending evolutionary arms race. We find that the number of such systems is of the order of 10 for a broad range of assumptions about the costs and benefits of defense and counter-defense mechanisms and their specificity. This optimum in the number of defense and counter-defense systems appears as a result of a compromise between the metabolic and autoimmune costs of adding a new layer of defense and the benefits it conveys.

1 Significance statementAlmost all living creatures are either predators or prey (and many are both). At all scales of life, from single cells to largest mammals, prey evolve defenses against predators and predators in their turn evolve counter-defense mechanisms. As a result of this ever-lasting arms race, each organism usually possesses multilayer defense and counter-defense arsenals. Is there a limit to the size of these arsenals? In this work we present a proof-of-principle argument that such a limit indeed exists. Using for definity an example of prokaryotes as the prey and their viruses as predators, we show that the number of distinct defense and counter-defense system that the prey and predators possess is limited by a number of the order of 10 and is only weakly dependent on the ecology of predator-prey interactions. Similar principles and limits likely emerge universally in various antagonistic conflicts such as crime and law enforcement or real arms race."
"Late leaf spot (LLS), caused by Nothopassalora personata, is the most damaging foliar disease in peanut production worldwide, leading to significant yield losses if not properly managed. Accurate disease severity assessment is crucial for evaluating fungicide efficacy and implementing effective management strategies. This study aimed to develop and validate an automated image analysis model, LLS-SevEst, for quantifying LLS severity in peanut leaves. A dataset of 190 scanned leaf images was analyzed using three approaches: a fixed threshold-based segmentation, morphological preprocessing, and K-means clustering. Exploratory analyses revealed distinct brightness patterns between healthy and diseased tissues, guiding the development of classification functions. The threshold-based model yielded high false positive rates due to its inability to account for natural leaf variation, while the morphological preprocessing method improved segmentation marginally but still required manual adjustments. The K-means clustering approach achieved superior segmentation by objectively differentiating healthy tissue, lesions, and background, and showed high potential for automated, reproducible disease severity estimation. Future work should focus on integrating deep learning and expanding the dataset to improve model robustness and adaptability to other foliar pathosystems."
"Human decision-makers have a well-established preference for controllable environments. We combined a hierarchical gambling task with cross-sectional administration of psychometric surveys and computational cognitive modeling, to assess whether this preference extends to contexts in which decision outcomes benefit others, specifically charitable organizations. In neurotypical individuals (n=100), there was a dramatic reduction in the preference for free choice across self- and charity-benefiting gambling contexts when freely chosen options yielded divergent outcome distributions - i.e., when free choice afforded control over decision outcomes. This selective modulation is consistent with a cost-benefit analysis, trading cognitive effort and controllability gains against the utilities of earning money for oneself vs. for a charity. When the same task was administered to individuals with self-reported obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n=108) the preference for control over decision outcomes was preserved across self- and charity-benefiting contexts, consistent with a responsibility-OCD subtype and with an excessive subjective utility of control more generally."
"The pentameric C-reactive protein (pCRP), an acute-phase protein, binds to lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) displayed on the surface of dying cells and microorganisms to activate the complement system and to opsonize immune cells via Fc{gamma}-receptors (Fc{gamma}Rs). Members of the Fc{gamma}R family are characterized by the recognition of the Fc part of IgG antibodies. We utilized a mouse thymoma BW5147 reporter cell panel stably expressing chimeric human Fc{gamma}R-CD3{zeta}-chain receptors to define the molecular requirements for Fc{gamma}R crosslinking by C-reactive protein (CRP). Applying this approach, we show a robust activation of CD64/Fc{gamma}RI and CD32a/Fc{gamma}RIIa by immobilized CRP isoforms as well as triggering of inhibitory CD32b/Fc{gamma}RIIb. Of note, activation of Fc{gamma}RIIa was restricted to the 131R allelic variant but not observed with 131H. In contrast, Fc{gamma}RIII isoforms CD16aF, CD16aV and CD16b were not activated by pCRP, although binding of CRP isoforms to Fc{gamma}RIII was detectable. Activation of Fc{gamma}Rs by free pCRP in solution phase was considerably lower than with immobilized pCRP on hydrophilic plastic surfaces and readily abolished by IgG at serum level concentrations, whereas it was enhanced by the addition of streptococci. The types of Fc{gamma}Rs mainly responding to pCRP in solution phase (CD64/Fc{gamma}RI and CD32aR/Fc{gamma}RIIaR) clearly differed from Fc{gamma}Rs responding to soluble multimeric IgG complexes (i.e., CD16aV/Fc{gamma}RIIIaV and CD32aH/Fc{gamma}RIIaH). Compared to pCRP, monomeric CRP (mCRP) showed lower levels of activation in those selective Fc{gamma}Rs. Fc{gamma}R activation was linked to recognition by conformation-dependent CRP antibodies. Unmasking of the mAb 9C9-defined neoepitope in pCRP* correlated with the triggering of Fc{gamma}Rs, indicating that pCRP* is the major Fc{gamma}R-activating CRP conformation. The assay provides a novel, scalable approach to determine the molecular properties of CRP as a physiological ligand of Fc{gamma}R-mediated bioactivities.

Scope statementFc{gamma} receptors (Fc{gamma}Rs) are important immune regulators that come in different variants and combinations, making it difficult to predict which components will ultimately lead to immunological effector functions. Classical Fc{gamma}Rs are defined by their recognition of IgG-Fc, while other ligands, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), are often neglected. Circulating concentrations of CRP, an acute phase protein, are elevated during inflammatory responses. As a pattern recognition receptor, CRP binds to lysophosphatidylcholine expressed on the surface of dying cells and microbes in order to activate the complement system via C1q.

We have established a reporter cell assay platform that goes beyond ligand binding and takes a deeper look at the activation outcome(s) by CRP compared with IgG-Fc. This is the first comprehensive study defining CRP-responsive vs non-responsive Fc{gamma}Rs and investigating the interaction of Fc{gamma}Rs with CRP isoforms (pCRP/pCRP*/mCRP). We distinguish binding from receptor triggering using reporter cells stably expressing a chimeric Fc{gamma}R-CD3{zeta} chain, thereby defining the molecular requirements for Fc{gamma}R cross-linking by CRP. The assay provides a novel, sensitive and scalable approach to the properties of CRP as a ligand inducing Fc{gamma}R-mediated bioactivities."
"Pyruvate is the end-product of glycolysis and a central metabolite involved in many biochemical pathways. However, a lack of high-performance (i.e., {Delta}F/F0 > 10) single fluorescent protein (FP)-based biosensors has hindered efforts to investigate the physiological role of pyruvate. Here, we present the GreenPy1 and ApplePy1 series, which are green FP (GFP)-based and red FP (RFP)-based pyruvate biosensors, respectively. Both series exhibit large fluorescence intensity change ({Delta}F/F0 [~] 20 to >40) and a range of affinities (10s of M to several mM). We demonstrate the utility of these pyruvate biosensors for multicolor imaging of metabolite concentration changes in mammalian cells."
"Background/ObjectivesIdentification and characterization of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2, either by infection or vaccination, can inform the development of next-generation vaccines and antibody therapeutics with pan-SARS-CoV-2 protection.

MethodsThrough single B cell sorting and RT-PCR, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were isolated from a donor who experienced BA.5 or BF.7 breakthrough infection after three doses of inactivated vaccines. Their binding and neutralizing capacities were respectively measured with ELISA and pseudovirus-based neutralization assay. Their epitopes were mapped by competition ELISA and site- directed mutation.

ResultsAmong a total of 67 spike-specific mAbs cloned from the donor, four mAbs (KXD643, KXD652, KXD681, and KXD686) can neutralize all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants from wild-type to KP.3. Moreover, KXD643, KXD652, and KXD681 belong to a clonotype encoded by IGHV5-51 and IGKV1-13, and recognize the cryptic and conserved RBD-8 epitope on the receptor-binding domain (RBD). In contrast, KXD686 is encoded by IGHV1-69 and IGKV3-20, and targets a conserved epitope (NTD Site iv) outside the antigenic supersite (NTD Site i) of the N-terminal domain (NTD). Notably, antibody cocktails containing these two groups of mAbs can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 more potently due to synergistic effects. In addition, bispecific antibodies derived from KXD643 and KXD686 demonstrate further improved neutralizing potency compared to antibody cocktails.

ConclusionsThese four mAbs can be developed as candidates of pan-SARS-CoV-2 antibody therapeutics through further antibody engineering. On the other hand, vaccines designed to simultaneously elicit neutralizing antibodies towards RBD-8 and NTD Site iv have the potential to provide pan-SARS-CoV-2 protection."
"BackgroundAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are characterized by an intricate interplay of extracellular matrix degradation and inflammation. Macrophages are centrally involved in these processes. The mechanisms underlying macrophage activation in AAA remain incompletely understood. Vascular macrophages have been shown to express olfactory receptor 2 (Olfr2), a G-protein coupled receptor involved in mediating the sense of smelling and regulating inflammatory activity in macrophages. Whether Olfr2 plays a role in modulating macrophage responses in AAA formation remains unknown.

Methods & ResultsIn silico micro-array analysis showed increased expression of the human Olfr2 orthologue OR6A2 in AAA tissue compared to healthy aorta. Flow cytometric analysis revealed increased expression of OR6A2 on classical, non-classical, and intermediate monocytes of patients with a large AAA (> 5cm) in comparison to patients with smaller AAA (< 5cm). Up to 30% of vascular macrophages expressed OR6A2 in human AAA and Olfr2 in mouse AAA tissue. Olfr2 expression peaked on major histocompatibility complex II-high (MHCIIhigh) and C-C chemokine receptor type 2-low (CCR2low) aortic monocytes and macrophages on day 7 following experimental AAA initiation and decreased to baseline expression on day 28. Olfr2 gene (Olfr2-/-) deficiency protected mice from AAA formation, which was accompanied by lowered ECM degradation, reduced macrophage infiltration and increased smooth muscle cell content. Conversely, treatment with the Olfr2 agonist octanal exacerbated AAA formation and inflammation, while the antagonist citral reduced AAA formation in comparison to vehicle treated mice. Bulk transcriptome analysis of aortic tissue revealed reduced inflammatory gene expression in Olfr2-/- mice at day 7 following AAA initiation. Spectral flow cytometry resolved 20 aortic immune cell populations, which were largely reduced in quantity by Olfr2-deficiency at day 7 and day 28 post experimental AAA formation, while circulating leukocyte counts and monocyte subset distribution were not altered between Olfr2+/+ and Olfr2-/- mice. Circulating Ly6Chigh-monocytes exhibited reduced expression of the CX3C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) and CCR2 during AAA formation. Transcriptional analysis of monocytes confirmed downregulation of pathways associated with cell adhesion, motility and migration. In vitro, Olfr2-/- monocytes showed impaired migration towards the CX3CR1 ligand CX3CL1. Competitive transfer of Olfr2+/+ and Olfr2-/- monocytes confirmed reduced migratory capacity of Olfr2-/- monocytes into the developing AAA.

ConclusionWe demonstrate a critical relevance for Olfr2 in the modulation of the inflammatory response underlying AAA, which is mediated by enhanced monocyte recruitment."
"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common cause of lower urinary tract symptoms/dysfunction (LUTS/LUTD) in aging men. Over the past 30 years, the prevalence of BPH has increased by 122%, rising from 50.7 million cases in 1990 to 112.5 million in 2021. It is expected that this number will continue to rise over the next 15 years with the global aging population. Although mouse models are invaluable for studying human disease, gross anatomical differences between human and murine prostates complicate their translational relevance for BPH/LUTS research. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a nanoCT-based imaging approach to enable detailed anatomical analysis of the murine lower urinary tract, with the dual goals of advancing tools for LUTD research and improving the translational relevance of mouse models to human prostate disease. Advancements in nano-computed tomography (nanoCT) have enabled high-resolution characterization of murine organ anatomy, providing new insights into how morphological differences contribute to pathology. To accomplish this, whole lower urogenital tracts from 8-week-old healthy male C57BL/6J mice and microdissected urethras were imaged on a v|tome|x M or nanotom M nano-CT system, respectively. Images were processed for 2D segmentation and subsequent 3D reconstruction using DragonFly 3D World software. Our approach enabled high-resolution visualization and characterization of the murine lower urogenital tract, including the urinary bladder, prostate lobes, seminal vesicles, and ductus deferens, as well as the microscopic ductal architecture of the prostatic urethra. The resulting 3D reconstructions preserved native anatomical relationships and allowed for comparisons between murine and human prostate anatomy. Together, these findings establish a method that can be used for assessing anatomical and morphological changes associated with LUTD development, while also highlighting key anatomical similarities that enhance the translational relevance of mouse models for human prostate disease."
"Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are important in bacterial communication and the transfer of virulence factors. In this study, we identified and characterized the surface layer protein (SLP) AvsA (Aeromonas veronii surface protein A) in the OMVs of Aeromonas veronii Hm21, a strain isolated from the medicinal leech Hirudo verbana. The surface layer proteins (SLPs) play critical roles in how bacteria interact with each other and their environments, particularly in mediating antibiotic resistance and facilitating host colonization. Furthermore, we investigate the ability of AvsA to confer protection against antibiotics, affect biofilm formation, and contribute to host colonization, providing insight into antibiotic resistance and two crucial factors contributing to the persistence of the bacteria in its host. Our findings suggest that AvsA enhances antibiotic tolerance, facilitates biofilm development, and is important for successful colonization of the leech digestive tract. These data demonstrate that AvsA performs important roles in a wide range of critical phenotypes. This work provides insights into the functional significance of SLPs in A. veronii and highlights AvsA as a potential target for modulating bacterial colonization and resilience against antibiotics.

ImportanceOuter membrane vesicles (OMVs) are important for bacterial communication, pathogenesis, and stress adaptation, yet how this is accomplished remains poorly understood. Here, we identify and characterize a surface layer protein (SLP), AvsA, associated with OMVs in Aeromonas veronii Hm21. Bioinformatic, phylogenetic, and mass spectrometry analyses suggest that Aeromonas veronii ORF M001_06550 encodes a surface layer protein (SLP) with high similarity to a characterized A. hydrophila SLP, supporting its designation as Aeromonas veronii Surface Protein A (AvsA). AvsA forms a paracrystalline layer on bacterial cells and OMVs. Functionally, AvsA contributes to antibiotic resistance, enhances biofilm formation, and is essential for colonization in a symbiotic host, the medicinal leech. These findings highlight a novel role of SLPs in bacterial physiology and host interactions. Given the widespread presence of AvsA homologs, our study provides insights into conserved bacterial mechanisms that may be relevant for both pathogenic and beneficial host-microbe interactions."
"Single-molecule localization microscopy methods such as dSTORM require specific buffer conditions to enable blinking and detection of individual emitters, making them incompatible with live cell imaging and expansion microscopy. An alternative approach to achieve super-resolution without blinking is to observe the fluctuations of the emitter intensity over time. Existing localization algorithms for high-emitter density make use of radial symmetry or use artificial neural networks trained on single high-density frames to predict emitter positions. Here, we aim to improve the resolution by using a larger temporal context. We combine the U-Net architecture used previously for image reconstruction with multi-head attention used in the Transformer architecture. We compare the results to DECODE and eSRRF as well as to traditional fitting algorithms on public benchmark data. A generic pre-trained model is provided together with a fast and robust simulator for training data and all scripts needed to train custom networks."
"Goal-directed motor performance relies on the brains ability to distinguish between actions that lead to successful and unsuccessful outcomes. The basal ganglia (BG) and cerebellum (CBL) are integral to processing performance outcomes, yet their functional interactions remain underexplored. This study scanned participants brains with functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) while they performed a skilled motor task for monetary rewards, where outcomes depended on their motor performance and also probabilistic events that were not contingent on their performance. We found successful motor outcomes increased activity in the ventral striatum (VS), a functional sub-region of the BG, whereas unsuccessful motor outcomes engaged the CBL. In contrast, for probabilistic outcomes unrelated to motor performance, the BG and CBL exhibited no differences in activity between successful and unsuccessful outcomes. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that VS-to-CBL connectivity was inhibitory following successful motor outcomes, suggesting that the VS may suppress CBL error processing for correct actions. Conversely, CBL-to-VS connectivity was inhibitory after unsuccessful motor outcomes, potentially preventing reinforcement of erroneous actions. Additionally, interindividual differences in task preference, assessed by having participants choose between performing the motor task or flipping a coin for monetary rewards, were related to inhibitory VS-CBL connectivity. These findings highlight a performance-mediated functional network between the VS and CBL, modulated by motivation and subjective preferences, supporting goal-directed behavior."
"The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to support cognitive flexibility by forming and maintaining generalized representations of abstract tasks. The formation of these representations as well as their relation to preexisting representations of contextual or spatial information is incompletely understood. In this study, we analyzed longitudinal 1-photon calcium recordings in mice performing an olfaction-guided spatial memory task over an eight-week period that included habituation, training, and sleep epochs. Our results reveal that, while a minority of neurons initially conveyed significant information about the behavior of the animal, the bulk of task-related activity only emerged after the animals reached proficient performance. Although goal arm information is robustly represented at both the single-cell and network levels both during learning and in task proficient mice, it undergoes significant remapping throughout the learning process. Additionally, we identified the establishment of recurring sequences during learning and their replay at reward locations, with no evidence of them existing during odor sampling phase, during sleep or before training. These findings suggest that the mPFC predominantly establishes generalized task representations de novo during learning, relying only minimally on preexisting spatial representations and that sub-second neural sequences in the mPFC are more likely involved in evaluating behavioral outcomes rather than planning future actions."
"Multicellular organisms develop a wide variety of highly-specialized cell types. The consistency and robustness of developmental cell fate trajectories suggests that complex gene regulatory networks effectively act as low-dimensional cell fate landscapes. A complementary set of works draws on the theory of dynamical systems to argue that cell fate transitions can be categorized into universal decision-making classes. However, the theory connecting geometric landscapes and decision-making classes to high-dimensional gene expression space is still in its infancy. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model that allows us to identify gene expression signatures of decision-making classes from single-cell RNA-sequencing time-series data. Our model combines low-dimensional gradient-like dynamical systems and high-dimensional Hopfield networks to capture the interplay between cell fate, gene expression, and signaling pathways. We apply our model to the maturation of alveolar cells in mouse lungs to show that the transient appearance of a mixed alveolar type 1/type 2 state suggests the triple cusp decision-making class. We also analyze lineage-tracing data on hematopoetic differentiation and show that bipotent neutrophil-monocyte progenitors likely undergo a heteroclinic flip bifurcation. Our results suggest it is possible to identify universal decision-making classes for cell fate transitions directly from data."
"The N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) modification is one of the most abundant chemical modifications in mammalian transcriptome, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression across various biological processes. In this study, we investigate the role of N4-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), the sole enzyme responsible for catalyzing the ac4C modification, in uterine function. Our findings revealed that knockdown of NAT10 in cultured human endometrial stromal cells leads to decreased progesterone receptor (PGR) expression and compromised decidualization. Mechanistically, NAT10 is found to enhance the stability of PGR mRNA through its ac4C modification in the coding sequence (CDS). Furthermore, conditional deletion of Nat10 in the mouse uterus using Pgr-Cre resulted in defective pubertal uterine development, characterized by a thinner stroma and reduced endometrial gland number. These mice were infertile in adulthood, experiencing failures in both implantation and decidualization. However, heterozygous Nat10 conditional knockout mice showed reduced NAT10 expression in the uterus without affecting uterine development or fertility. To bridge the gap between heterozygous and homozygous knockout conditions, we employed Remodelin, an inhibitor of NAT10, in adult female mice, to mimic an intermediate gene dosage. Our results demonstrated that inhibiting NAT10 with Remodelin preserved uterine structures but disrupted the PGR signaling pathway, leading to impaired uterine function during pregnancy. In conclusion, our study provides compelling evidence that NAT10 safeguards uterine function and fertility by regulating the ac4C modification of PGR mRNA.

SignificanceHere we identified NAT10-catalyzed ac4C modification of progesterone receptor (PGR) mRNA as a crucial mechanism regulating PGR expression by enhancing its mRNA stability. In vitro studies using human endometrial stromal cells show that the NAT10-PGR axis is required for decidualization. Additionally, genetic and pharmacologic manipulations in mice further demonstrate the necessity of NAT10-dependent P4/PGR signaling for uterine function during implantation and decidualization. Our findings highlight the importance of NAT10-mediated ac4C modification in maintaining PGR expression and uterine function."
"Cardiotoxicity is a significant challenge in cancer therapies, particularly with doxorubicin, a widely used anthracycline known for its broad anti-cancer spectrum but life-threatening cardiac side effects. There is a critical need for more predictive in vitro models to understand doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and patient-specific drug responses. In this study, we used human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs), cardiac fibroblasts (hPSC-cFBs) and endothelial cells (hPSC-ECs) to investigate the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin in two-dimensional mono-and multi-cell type cultures. By mimicking the cumulative dose effect seen in patients through repeated doxorubicin treatments and using a machine learning-based in silico image analysis tool, we could precisely quantify caspase 3/7 activity as an early toxicity marker and identify hPSC-CMs in multi-cell type cultures. This innovative approach allowed continuous monitoring of apoptosis from phase-contrast images, revealing that hPSC-ECs showed higher sensitivity to doxorubicin than isogenic hPSC-CMs or hPSC-cFBs and significantly enhanced cardiomyocyte toxicity in co-culture. In contrast, dermal fibroblasts differentiated from the same hPSC line showed no toxic response under the same treatment regimen. These results challenge the conventional focus on cardiomyocytes as the target of drug-induced cardiac damage. Our findings not only highlight the complex interplay among different cardiac cell types in mediating the toxic effects of doxorubicin, but also demonstrate the potential of AI-enabled tools to advance personalized drug screening and safety assessments."
"Transient surges in gene or protein expression often mark the key regulatory checkpoints that propel cells from one functional state to the next, yet they are easy to miss in sparse, noisy single-cell omics data. We introduce scTransient, a trajectory-inference pipeline integrated into our cloud-based single-cell analysis platform PSCS. scTransient transforms single-cell expression profiles into continuous pseudotime signals and couples them with wavelet-based signal processing to isolate short-lived but biologically meaningful bursts of activity. After ordering cells with unsupervised graph trajectories or supervised psupertime, scTransient windows expression values along pseudotime, applies a continuous wavelet transform, and assigns every gene a Transient-Event Score (TES) that rewards sharp, isolated coefficients while penalizing background fluctuations. Synthetic benchmarks show TES robustly recovers transient events across a wide range of cell numbers, signal-to-noise ratios, and event widths. Applying scTransient to three public datasets-- hematopoietic differentiation, monocyte-to-macrophage maturation, and single-cell proteomic cell-cycle progression--uncovers previously unreported, process-specific expression spikes. These include erythropoiesis regulators (e.g., Nfe2), membrane-raft remodeling proteins during macrophage differentiation, and S-phase DNA-replication factors in A549 cells. Functional enrichment confirms that top-scoring genes cluster into pathways directly pertinent to each transition. By extending trajectory inference from descriptive ordering to quantitative detection of fleeting regulatory programs, scTransient--now readily accessible via the PSCS web interface--offers researchers a practical route to uncovering transient molecular events that drive development, differentiation, and disease."
"Drug development is a lengthy and high-risk process, with most investigational drug candidates failing in phase II randomized clinical trials (RCT) due to insufficient efficacy. It makes early prediction of trial outcomes crucial for reducing attrition and guiding strategic decisions, especially in immunology and inflammation (I&I) diseases. Herein, we present EVA, the first pre-trained foundation model in complex inflammatory diseases tailored to support drug development. EVA learns generalizable patterns from large-scale data of cell biology and immunology, enabling superior predictive performance and generalization compared to traditional approaches. EVA is pre-trained on tens of millions of single-cell RNA-seq samples and tens of thousands of bulk RNA-seq samples from I&I diseases patients, enabling it to learn disease-relevant transcriptomic patterns in this therapeutic area. By fine-tuning EVA in few-shot settings on both preclinical (mouse) and clinical (human) data and harnessing its wide pre-training knowledge, EVA predicts drug responses in I&I with high precision at both cohort and patient levels, as illustrated by accurate forecasting of anti-TNF therapeutic activity in ulcerative colitis. By deciphering its decision process, we further highlight that EVAs ability to stratify patients based on predicted drug response can also be leveraged to discover drug response biomarkers as early as preclinical stages. EVAs applications in precision immunology encompass therapeutic target validation prior to clinical entry, identification of patient subpopulations most likely to benefit from treatment, and comparative efficacy analysis against competitor compounds. EVAs versatility makes it an invaluable tool for strategic decision-making throughout the drug development pipeline: by leveraging it to prioritize the most promising drug candidates and optimize RCT designs, it can contribute to reduce late-stage failures and accelerate the delivery of effective therapies. Overall, this work represents a significant advancement in utilizing a pre-trained foundation model for precision drug development in complex inflammatory diseases.

Graphical abstractEVA is a pre-trained foundation model specific to immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. It enables the prediction of therapeutic efficacy in patients leveraging data from preclinical disease models.

"Germ cells transmit genetic information to the next generation in multicellular organisms. In Drosophila melanogaster, germ cells are determined by germ plasm, a specialised cytoplasm assembled by the Oskar protein. The current view of the molecular mechanism of germ plasm assembly attributes recruitment of protein and mRNA germ plasm components to distinct domains of the Oskar protein, called the LOTUS and OSK domains respectively. However, most evidence for this model is based on in vitro studies. Here we test the ability of Oskar variants to assemble functional germ plasm in vivo. We found that Vasa recruitment was largely unperturbed by LOTUS deletion or mutations in vivo. In contrast, nanos and pgc mRNA recruitment was affected by LOTUS domain perturbations, despite the current model attributing mRNA recruitment to the distinct OSK domain. Taken together, these data suggest a revision of the prevailing modular view of Oskars structure-function mechanism."
"To understand why close wild plant relatives of crops, such as Solanum dulcamara, are resistant to Ralstonia solanacearum we need genetic resources to perform comparative studies and identify key genes and pathways. We de-novo assembled and annotated the genome of resistant S. dulcamara and susceptible Solanum nigrum plants using a hybrid approach including Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Illumina sequencing. Comparative genomic analysis was then performed to find differences between the genome of S. dulcamara and other susceptible Solanaceous species including potato, tomato, aubergine, and S. nigrum and one susceptible and one resistant S. americanum accession. We identified genes associated with auxin-transport only in S. dulcamara and a collection of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) was identified in orthogroups only found in plant species with resistant/tolerant phenotype, suggesting novel plant receptors in these accessions that may improve recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) associated with R. solanacearum. We also identified differences in methylation frequency across the gene bodies in both species, which may be associated with epigenetic regulation of resistance. Future work should assess the functional role of these PRRs during bacterial wilt development to determine if they could offer potential novel targets for breeding improved wilt resistance."
"The evolutionary origins of the genetic point centromere in the brewers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a member of the order Saccharomycetales, are still unknown. Competing hypotheses suggest that the point centromere tripartite genetic centromere DNA elements (CDEs) either evolved from ancestral epigenetic centromeres by descent with modification or were gained through horizontal transfer from selfish DNA plasmids.1,2 Here, we identified centromeres in the sister order Saccharomycodales and termed them ""proto-point centromeres"" due to sequence features that bridge the evolutionary gap between point centromeres and ancestral centromeres types. Comparative genomic analyses across multiple yeast orders showed an unexpected evolutionary link between point and proto-point centromeres to the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of Ty5 retrotransposons. Strikingly, one Saccharomycodales species, Saccharomycodes ludwigii, harbors compact Ty5-based centromeres, where its CDEII elements are divergent AT-rich Ty5 LTRs. These living fossil centromeres show how retrotransposon cis-regulation was likely co-opted for genetic centromere specification. These insights show that point centromeres are direct descendants of retrotransposons and have evolved by descent with modification. Ultimately, the many diverse centromere types across the yeast subphylum may share a common ancestry rooted in retrotransposon activity."
"The evolution of insect host adaptation is a key component of insect-plant coevolution, a complex process often shaped by multiple evolutionary events. In this study, we identified two UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) genes, SfruUGT33T10 and SfruUGT33F32, in the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda, which play critical roles in the tolerance of benzoxazinoids (BXs), secondary metabolites in maize. These two detoxification enzymes exhibited distinct glycosylation patterns for BXs and varying detoxification efficiencies, reflecting independent evolutionary trajectories. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that SfruUGT33T10 originated independently within Noctuidae, while SfruUGT33F32 resulted from tandem duplication within the UGT33F gene family and may have undergone neofunctionalization within the Spodoptera genus. Our findings provide evidence that the evolution of these two UGT paralogs contributed to the variation in the tolerance to maize BXs among different Lepidopteran species. This research underscores the significance of multiple independent evolutionary routes in host plant adaptation and offer new insights into the complex evolutionary processes underlying insect-plant interactions."
"Motor learning transfer, the ability to apply skills acquired in one task to enhance performance in a related task, is driven by changes in neural ensemble activities. However, the long-term evolution of neural population dynamics during motor learning transfer remains unclear. Specifically, how do the neural patterns reorganize and stabilize over an extended learning period in the new task? To investigate the neural mechanisms in the motor cortex that enable such transfer, we employed a Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) paradigm in rats. In the experiment, rats first mastered a lever-pressing task before proceeding to a more complex but related lever-discrimination task. We analyzed neural ensemble activities by projecting them into a low-dimensional linear feature space that captures the most prominent dynamic structure. Within this space, we represented neural patterns as clusters and developed an iterative method to align similar clusters between the two tasks. Leveraging this alignment, we introduced a novel decoding approach, Clustering Alignment-based Transfer on Kernel Reinforcement Learning (CATKRL), which utilizes parameters learned from the initial task to enhance efficiency in the new task. Our results revealed that neural patterns for learned actions form distinct clusters with consistent shapes and centroid distances across tasks, and these patterns exhibit rotational evolution during learning. By integrating the cluster alignment mechanism into the RL decoder, we achieved a faster training speed with less data in the lever-discrimination task. Our results suggest that aligning neural pattern clusters can enhance BMI decoding efficiency by leveraging consistent neural representations. This approach not only provides valuable insights into the brain mechanisms underlying motor learning transfer but also holds promise for advancing multi-task learning in neuroprosthetics."
"While transcription and translation have been shown to be coordinated with mRNA decay across various single-gene studies, their global coordination remains poorly defined. Therefore, we performed Rif-seq experiments in C. crescentus to measure genome-wide mRNA lifetimes and analyzed the impact of transcription and translation. Based upon the RNAP elongation speed, we identified that approximately 20% of mRNAs were cotranscriptionally degraded. We generated absolute quantitative estimates of mRNA copy numbers in C. crescentus, a useful systems biology resource, revealing that some gene categories have coordinated mRNA turnover. To investigate translations impact on mRNA decay, we found that translation efficiency measured by ribosome profiling correlates with mRNA lifetime. We compared the 5 P cleavage sites to ribosome occupancy and found that cleavage sites occur preferentially in regions of low ribosome occupancy. Using the translation initiation inhibitor retapamulin, which traps ribosomes at the start codon, and chloramphenicol, which arrests elongating ribosomes, shows that chloramphenicol leads to global mRNA stabilization. Surprisingly, we find that the codon adaptation index is inversely correlated with mRNA lifetime, suggesting slow translation elongation may be stabilizing mRNAs from decay. We confirmed the roles of translation initiation and elongation on mRNA lifetimes by generating synthetic YFP and mCherry reporter mRNAs. Taken together, mRNA decay is globally interconnected with transcription and translation.

Highlights[bullet] Quantitative analysis yields absolute mRNA abundance and half-lives for C. crescentus
[bullet]Identification of 47 new stable ncRNAs
[bullet]Both transcription and translation are globally coordinated with mRNA decay
[bullet]Translation initiation and elongation impact mRNA decay through ribosome occupancy"
"A single dynamical equation for the virus to microbe ratio (VMR) shows that an optimal tradeoff occurs between a short lysis time and low burst size vs. a long lysis time and large burst size. The model predicts that interventions lowering phage adsorption by killing free virus and/or limiting their access to bacteria cause the evolution of an increased lysis time and higher burst size until the intervention either drives a virulent phage extinct or, for temperate phage, drives the phage from its lytic phase into its lysogenic phase. The model also predicts that an intervention that lowers bacterial growth, R, induces the prophages within it to switch to their lytic phase. An intervention that simultaneously lowers both viral accessibility to bacteria and bacterial growth rate may increase the net virus to bacterial ratio (VMR), a result reminiscent of the Volterra principle for predator-prey dynamics in ecology."
"O_LIAlthough plants share core cell division mechanisms with other eukaryotes, their unique features--such as acentrosomal spindle formation and cytokinesis via the phragmoplast--suggest the existence of plant-specific genes. This study used the model bryophyte Physcomitrium patens to uncover such genes and employed CRISPR-based screening to identify novel cell division genes in plants.
C_LIO_LICo-expression data from known mitotic genes were used to create a pool of 216 candidate genes, which were then targeted in CRISPR/Cas9 screening. Frameshift mutants with division defects were characterized using high-resolution imaging of mitosis and gene tagging with fluorophores for localization analysis.
C_LIO_LIThree novel gene families--CYR (Cytokinesis-Related), LACH (Lagging Chromosome), and SpinMi (Spindle and Phragmoplast Midzone)--were identified. CYR genes were linked to cytokinesis defects, LACH was essential for chromosome segregation, and SpinMi localized to the spindle and phragmoplast midzone. Notably, none of these gene families had homologs in algae, suggesting their emergence during land colonization.
C_LIO_LIOur findings provide a framework for combining co-expression analysis with targeted screening to identify genes associated with specific cellular processes, in this case, cell division. Beyond characterizing three novel gene families, this study also offers insights into evolutionary changes in the plant cell division machinery.

"In human lupus nephritis (LuN), tubulointerstitial inflammation (TII) is prognostically more important than glomerular inflammation. However, a comprehensive understanding of both TII complexity and heterogeneity is lacking. Herein, we used high-dimensional confocal microscopy and specialized computer vision techniques to quantify immune cell populations and localize these within normal and diseased renal cortex structures. With these tools, we compared LuN to renal allograft rejection (RAR) and normal kidney. In both LuN and RAR, the 33 characterized immune cell populations formed discrete subgroups whose constituents co-varied in prevalence across biopsies. In both diseases, these co-variant immune cell subgroups organized into the same unique niches. Therefore, inflammation could be resolved into trajectories representing the relative prevalence and density of cardinal immune cell members of each co-variant subgroup. Indeed, in any one biopsy, the inflammatory state could be characterized by quantifying constituent immune cell trajectories. Remarkably, LuN heterogeneity could be captured by quantifying a few myeloid immune cell trajectories while RAR was more complex with additional T cell trajectories. Our studies identify rules governing renal inflammation and thus provide an approach for resolving LuN into discrete mechanistic categories.

"Endosomal toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR8 are critical sensors of microbial RNA that initiate antiviral and antibacterial immune responses through type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokine production. While TIRAP is traditionally associated with plasma membrane TLR signaling, recent evidence suggests it also contributes to signaling via endosomal TLRs. Here, we examined the role of TIRAP in TLR7/8 signaling using P7-Pen, a novel SLAMF1-derived peptide that disrupts the TIRAP-MyD88 interaction. In primary human monocytes and a whole blood model, P7-Pen inhibited TLR7- and TLR8-induced expression and secretion of IRF5-regulated cytokines IFN{beta}, IL-12p40, and IL-12p70, without effect on TNF or IL-6. Mechanistically, P7-Pen blocked TIRAP recruitment to the TLR8-MyD88 complex, leading to reduced late-stage IRAK1 activation, Akt and IKK/{beta} phosphorylation, and downstream IRF5 dimerization and nuclear translocation. Inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus-induced cytokine production by P7-Pen was associated with reduced bacterial phagocytosis, impairing endosomal delivery of bacterial RNA. Notably, P7-Pen failed to inhibit murine TLR7 responses, which correlated with a lack of TIRAP recruitment to MyD88 in mouse macrophages following TLR7 ligand stimulation, highlighting species-specific differences in TLR signaling mechanisms. These findings support a noncanonical role for TIRAP in regulating IRF5-dependent signaling downstream of human TLR7 and TLR8, and demonstrate that selective disruption of TIRAP recruitment by a SLAMF1-derived peptide effectively attenuates IFN{beta} production. This strategy may hold therapeutic potential in diseases characterized by dysregulated type I IFN responses, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and chronic infections."
"Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), a major bacterial pathogen of poultry, is comprised of a diverse range of high-risk clonal groups. However, phenotypic interactions with the avian host cell and how they may differ between lineages remains poorly understood. Therefore, the ability of predominant and outbreak-associated APEC clonal groups to invade and survive within avian host cells, as well as virulence within the Galleria mellonella infection model was investigated. The molecular characterisation of APEC isolated from an outbreak of colibacillosis in turkey poults in the UK, identified APEC sequence type (ST)-101 as the dominant clonal group, carrying a high number of virulence factors. As such, ST-101 was compared as an outbreak-associated lineage to a range of predominant APEC high-risk clonal groups (ST-23, ST-140, ST-95, ST-117). Utilising in vitro cell culture models, APEC isolates displayed comparable adhesion to 8E11 chicken epithelial gut and HD11 chicken macrophage cell lines. However, a trend of increased invasion of the 8E11 cells, and intracellular survival within HD11 macrophages was observed for ST-95, ST-101, and ST-140 APEC, relative to ST-23 and ST-117, suggestive of pronounced phenotypic differences between clonal groups. However, in HD11 cell assays, no difference in magnitude of elicited immune response was observed between lineages, indicating lineages had differing capacities to resist phagocyte killing. In vivo virulence in the Galleria mellonella infection model was also observed to differ between APEC genotypes, with ST-117 inducing the highest mortality, despite the comparatively lower epithelial invasion and intramacrophage survival to other lineages. Collectively, this suggests a distinct phenotypic profile associated with high-risk clonal groups within APEC, potentially allowing the future development of broad-spectrum disease management strategies."
"The ability to profile gene expression at the single cell level can offer unprecedented insight into the vertebrate immune system. While such profiling of non-model organisms can present unique challenges (e.g. evolutionary idiosyncrasies), high resolution data on immune function could yield valuable insights into ecologically and economically important species. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to profile the immune system transcriptional repertoire of brown trout (Salmo trutta), a threatened index species and commonly using for stocking endangered wild populations, using multiple individuals derived from three distinct rearing backgrounds (wild-caught, farm reared for one generation or farm-reared for at least three generations). We subsequently present a collection of markers that are representative of the species accounting for disparate rearing histories. This revealed a repertoire which is broadly evolutionarily conserved, although many of the genes characterising neutrophil, macrophage, T-cell, B-cell and other lineages likely reflect the specific facets of salmonid immune evolution. The fates of duplicate gene pairs putatively arising from the salmonid-specific whole genome duplication event were also investigated, revealing that approximately half of duplicate genes examined show some degree of functional divergence within the immune system in terms of loss or gain of expression in certain clusters. Finally, comparing cluster-level gene expression profiles between different rearing backgrounds revealed that single or multigenerational exposure to a farm environment induces transcriptional alterations in neutrophils, macrophages, B-cells and T-cells."
"At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the absence of a rapid and highly specific diagnostic method for the SARS-CoV-2 virus led to significant delays in detection, adversely affecting clinical outcomes. This shortfall highlights the urgent need for adaptable, scalable, and reusable diagnostic technologies to improve future pandemic responses. To address this challenge, we developed a renewable electrochemical impedance biosensor device employing a synthetic nucleotide-based therapeutic aptamer (termed  aptasensor) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). We demonstrate that our aptasensor can detect the Omicron BA.2 S protein within one hour and possesses concentration-dependent sensitivity at biologically relevant levels. Notably, the aptasensor is reusable after regeneration by a simple pH 2 buffer treatment. Aptamer binding to the S protein was confirmed by immunogold labeling and visualization by negative-stain electron microscopy. We used cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to resolve high-resolution maps of the S protein in both the open and closed conformations and characterized aptamer binding to the up RBD in the open conformation. Taken together, these results establish the versatility and scalability of aptamer-based biosensors, presenting them as a potential transformative diagnostic platform for emerging pathogens. This combination of rapid detection, specificity, and renewable capabilities in a single diagnostic solution marks a significant advance in pandemic preparedness."
"Endophytic fungi produce a diverse range of bioactive secondary metabolites with potential applications in biopesticide development. This study investigates the nematicidal and antifeedant properties of ethyl acetate extracts from endophytic fungi isolated from wild Arabidopsis thaliana populations in Spain. The extracts were tested against the plant-parasitic nematode Meloidogyne javanica, and two common insect pests, Myzus persicae and Spodoptera littoralis. Nine of the 13 extracts demonstrated significant nematicidal and/or antifeedant activity, indicating their potential as biopesticides. The active extracts were derived from six genera: Alternaria (3 isolates), Dydimella (1), Dothiora (1), Pleiochaeta (1), Penicillium (1), and Fusarium (2). Five extracts exhibited nematicidal activity above 90%, with three reducing the total number of M. javanica second-stage juveniles hatched from egg masses by 22-37%. Four extracts showed strong settling inhibition (>70%) against M. persicae, and three exhibited feeding inhibition against S. littoralis. Chemical analysis by GC-MS and LC-MS revealed a wide array of unique secondary metabolites in the active extracts, reflecting substantial chemical diversity, regardless of the fungal origin. This study highlights the potential of fungal endophytes from A. thaliana as sources of novel biopesticides, paving the way for future research focused on harnessing these fungi for biopesticide development."
"Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels shape action potentials, with their activity dependent on anionic lipids and modulated by membrane tension. However, the mechanism by which lipids regulate channel gating is not entirely clear. Cryo-electron microscopy studies suggest that in the down state-- typically associated with the inactive channel--arginines of the voltage sensor interact with lipid phosphates, pulling them upward and locally thinning the membrane by [~]5 [A]. This thinning is absent in the up state of the sensor, which is typically associated with the active channel. To test whether membrane thickness influences gating, we reconstituted Aeropyrum pernix Kv (KvAP) channels into planar lipid bilayers containing photoswitchable lipids. Blue light increased membrane thickness and KvAP activity, while UV light reversed these effects. Our results indicate that membrane thickening disrupts voltage sensor-lipid phosphate interactions, lowering the activation barrier for the up-movement of the voltage sensor and thus, channel opening. The resulting leftward shift in the current-voltage relationship demonstrates a light-driven approach to modulating Kv channel activity, with potential applications in neuronal excitability control.

SignificanceVoltage-gated Kv channels respond to membrane voltage in a manner influenced by lipid composition and membrane tension. In the inactive state, voltage-sensing arginines interact with lipid phosphates, and when these interactions are strained--such as by membrane thickening or possibly by membrane tension--less voltage is required for channel opening. We demonstrate this interdependence by showing that a light-triggered increase in membrane thickness reversibly enhances Kv channel activity, directly linking membrane mechanics to voltage sensing. This work also establishes a light-based strategy for spatially precise Kv channel modulation."
"The alternative oxidase (AOX) is naturally present in the mitochondrial electron transfer system (ETS) of many organisms but absent in vertebrates and most insects. AOX oxidizes coenzyme Q and reduces O2 in H2O, partially replacing the ETS cytochrome c segment and alleviating the oxidative stress caused by ETS overload. As successfully demonstrated in animal models, AOX shows potential in mitigating mitochondrial diseases. However, its non-proton-pumping nature may uncouple mitochondria, leading to excessive heat generation and interference with normal metabolism and physiology. Here we show that AOX from the tunicate Ciona intestinalis accelerates development of Drosophila melanogaster, elevating larval biomass accumulation (primarily due to increased fat), mobility and food intake, without increasing body heat production. AOX intensifies Leak respiration and lowers oxidative phosphorylation efficiency through functional interactions with the mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH). This is associated with increased complex I (CI)-driven respiration and supercomplex formation, higher cellular NAD+/NADH ratios, and an enhanced flux through the central carbon metabolism. Chemical uncouplers and rotenone confirm the roles of mitochondrial uncoupling and CI in the development of AOX-expressing larvae. Thus, AOX appears to be promoting increased growth by reinforcing the larval proliferative metabolic program via an intricate mechanism that reconfigures the larval ETS."
"Batesian mimics, such as hoverflies, can gain protection by resembling noxious species that predators avoid, such as bees. Such resemblance can be behavioural as well as morphological. Bees commonly have a preference for blue flowers, whilst flies generally prefer yellow and white. We predicted that, driven by selection for enhanced mimicry, bee-mimicking hoverflies would have switched flower preference from yellow to blue, to follow the flower choices of their models. We gathered internet photographs of flower-visiting bees and wasps, their hoverfly mimics, and non-mimicking hoverflies, and compared the colours of the visited flowers. Flowers visited by bumblebees were ""bluer"" than those visited by other hymenopterans (honeybees, wasps and solitary bees). Correspondingly, flowers visited by bumblebee-mimicking hoverflies were bluer than those visited by non-mimics, and were indistinguishable in blueness from those visited by bumblebees. There was no such pattern in flower ""yellowness"", where all flies and most hymenopterans preferred similar yellowness, and only bumblebees chose less yellow flowers than the others. Our study demonstrates widespread changes in microhabitat choice (specifically flower preference) among a diverse group of Batesian mimics, consistent with the idea of behavioural mimicry. Mildly noxious models such as bumblebees are thought to exert particularly strong selection for mimetic accuracy, suggesting that habitat-choice mimicry may be selected as a way of enhancing morphological mimicry."
"The sound-induced flash illusion (SIFI) refers to the observation that pairing a single flash with 2 auditory beeps leads to the illusory perception of 2 visual stimuli (fission illusion). Susceptibility to the illusion depends on many factors like exact physical stimulus parameters, participants expectations, attention, age, and clinical/non-clinical population membership. While there exist many experimental studies, very few models have been proposed to account for the phenomenon. Here we suggest a formal model (SIFI-TWIN) based on the notion of a temporal binding window that predicts the occurrence of illusory flashes as a function of the temporal and physical stimulus arrangement. The models performance is illustrated on a study investigating differences in SIFI performance between elderly hearing aid users and those with the same degree of mild hearing loss who were not using hearing aids. The results suggests that the higher incidence of reporting an illusory flash for hearing-aid users is due to both a larger temporal window of integration and a larger bias to report the illusion. The SIFI-TWIN model will help to better understand the diverse results from clinical and non-clinical studies as well as the cognitive foundations of the SIFI."
"Phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC) describes the tendency of evolutionary lineages to retain functional traits over time, leading to closely related species exhibiting similar phenotypes and ecological niches. Traditional approaches to studying PNC focus on phylogenetic signal in trait means, often overlooking the conservation of trait variability across lineages. This oversight limits our understanding of the ecological constraints on species adaptation. Trait variance, influenced by genetic, ecological, and environmental factors, is crucial for understanding evolutionary processes and species adaptive potential. Phylogenetic location-scale models offer a promising framework to incorporate both mean and variance components of trait evolution, providing a more nuanced understanding of how ecological and evolutionary processes shape trait evolution across lineages. We apply this approach to leaf economic data for the genus Eucalyptus, demonstrating that models including predictors for both mean and variance offer greater predictive performance and deeper insights into the mechanisms of niche conservatism and ecological adaptation. Our findings highlight the importance of considering trait variance in studies of PNC and its implications for assessing species resilience to environmental change."
"Bacterial Blight (BB) is the most serious bacterial disease of rice. Usage of resistant cultivars has been a successful strategy in controlling BB. However, constant selection pressure causes the evolution of hypervirulent pathogenic strains that break down resistance, thus necessitating additional sources of resistance. An induced-mutant line derived from the elite rice cultivar Samba Mahsuri was identified to exhibit broad-spectrum resistance to BB. Using next-generation gene mapping approaches, we identified a genomic interval in chromosome 6 to be linked to BB resistance. Analysis of the SNPs in the locus and subsequent linkage analysis indicated that a missense SNP located in the second exon of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 6 (OsMAPK6) could be the causal mutation. A detailed examination of OsMAPK6 gene sequences in over 4000 rice genomes revealed that the mutant allele identified in this study is novel to rice germplasm. The candidate SNP causes the substitution of an invariant Serine residue with a Proline residue (S84P), thus likely affecting the protein function. Global transcriptome, metabolome, biochemical, and molecular analyses suggested that BB42 exhibit constitutive immunity. On the mechanistic front, the mutation seems to result in diminished brassinosteroid signaling in BB42. Taken together, we report a novel allele of a highly conserved MAPK gene and provide evidence for its possible association with constitutive immunity and disease resistance in rice."
"Abnormal nuclear morphology is a hallmark of human diseases, including cancers and age-related disorders. Previously, maintenance of nuclear morphology and integrity was thought to be solely dependent on a force balance between nuclear mechanical resistance and actin antagonism. However, our recent work revealed that inhibiting RNA polymerase II suppresses nuclear blebbing independent of altering force balance, but the mechanism remains unknown. Through removing cell culture media serum and then adding it back, we can decrease and then restore transcriptional activity. Decreasing transcriptional activity decreases nuclear bleb formation, stability, and rupture while returning transcriptional activity restores nuclear blebbing. These modulations of transcriptional activity did not alter nuclear or actin mechanics. The mean square displacement (MSD) of chromatin domains labeled via transfected Cy3-dNTPs revealed that transcription activity regulates chromatin motion. To determine if increasing chromatin motion is a mechanism to increase nuclear blebbing, we used an established RAD51 inhibitor BO2. We verified BO2 increases chromatin domain motion which resulted in increased nuclear blebbing. We reveal the mechanism by which transcriptional activity drives nuclear blebbing is through chromatin motion. Thus, two hallmarks of human disease are directly linked via transcriptional activity and abnormal nuclear shape.

Statement of SignificanceO_LINuclear blebs are hallmarks of disease progression that cause dysfunction, but how they are formed remains unanswered.
C_LIO_LIWe find that chromatin motion generated by transcriptional activity is essential for both nuclear bleb formation and stability. This was independent of changes in nuclear stiffness or actin antagonism.
C_LIO_LIThis finding provides a key advancement in our understanding of nuclear bleb formation. Furthermore, it reveals transcriptional activity as a novel contributor to nuclear blebbing in addition to the paradigm of nuclear shape determined as a force balance between nuclear resistance and actin antagonism.

"Intrinsic disorder regions (IDR) and soft disorder regions (SDR) provide crucial information on a protein structure to underpin its functioning, interaction with other molecules and assembly path. Circular dichroism experiments are used to identify intrinsic disorder residues, while SDRs are characterized using B-factors, missing residues, or a combination of both in alternative X-ray crystal structures of the same molecule. These flexible regions in proteins are particularly significant in diverse biological processes and are often implicated in pathological conditions. Accurate computational prediction of these disordered regions is thus essential for advancing protein research and understanding their functional implications. To address this challenge, LoRA-DR-suite employs a simple adapter-based architecture that utilizes protein language models embeddings as protein sequence representations, enabling the precise prediction of IDRs and SDRs directly from primary sequence data. Alongside the fast LoRA-DR-suite implementation, we release SoftDis, a unique soft disorder database constructed for approximately 500,000 PDB chains. SoftDis is designed to facilitate new research, testing, and applications on soft disorder, advancing the study of protein dynamics and interactions."
"Extinction-reinstatement paradigms have been used to study reward seeking for both food and drug rewards. The nucleus accumbens is of particular interest in reinstatement due to its ability to energize motivated behavior. Indeed, previous work has demonstrated that suppression of neuronal activity or dopaminergic signaling in the nucleus accumbens reduces reinstatement to food seeking. In this study, we sought to further establish a connection between glutamatergic input, measured by proxy via a genetically encoded calcium indicator, and dopamine (DA) tone, measured simultaneously with a red-shifted DA biosensor. We performed this sensor multiplexing in the nucleus accumbens core in the classic extinction-reinstatement paradigm with food reward. We detected DA transients that changed in magnitude and/or temporally shifted over the course of self-administration training. In our calcium traces we observed a decrease from baseline time-locked to the lever press for food reward, which became more prominent with training. Both patterns were reduced in the first session of extinction with no deflections from baseline detected in either the DA or calcium traces in the last extinction session. When we recorded during reinstatement tests, bootstrapping analysis detected a calcium response when reinstatement was primed by cue or pellet+cue presentation, while a DA response was detected for pellet+cue reinstatement. These data further establish a role for nucleus accumbens core activity and DA in reinstatement of food seeking and represent the first attempt to simultaneously record the two during an extinction-reinstatement task."

"BackgroundCalcific aortic valve stenosis (AS) affects 3% of older adults and lacks medical treatment. The deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) could be involved in many pathways linked to AS progression. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucose-lowering agents, have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events (likely via SIRT1), but their possible benefits in AS are unknown. Our study aims to uncover the role of SIRT1 in AS progression and assess the benefit of SGLT2i to slow down the aortic valve fibro-calcification processes.

MethodsRNA-seq data of human aortic valve specimens were collected from ARChS4 database. SIRT1 knockdown (SIRT1 KD) and overexpressing (SIRT1 Over) valve interstitial cells (VIC) were generated by CRISPR/Cas9. Real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, and calcification assays were used to characterized mutant VICs. Conditioned medium experiments were implemented to evaluate SGLT2i effect on cellular cross-talk and calcification. Diabetic patients data from the Lombardy regional healthcare database, treated with sulphonylureas (SU; no effect on SIRT1) and SGLT2i (acting on SIRT1), were selected and matched 1:1 by age, sex, and multisource comorbidity score. Cumulative incidence of hospitalization for non-rheumatic aortic valve disease was assessed by Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios.

ResultsRNA-seq showed that SIRT1 could be a master regulator of multiple AS-related pathways. Functional studies on mutant VICs revealed that SIRT1 directly regulates antioxidant processes, extracellular-matrix remodeling and calcification by modulating key transcription factors. Moreover, calcification assays further support this role, revealing an increased calcification in SIRT1 KD VICs and a concomitant decrease in VIC SIRT1 Over when compared to wild type. Then, exploring SGLT2i impact on calcification, we showed that VICs cultured in SGLT2i-treated-endothelial medium exhibited reduced calcification associated with endothelial-increased nitric oxide levels, while SIRT1 inhibition enhanced VIC calcification. The real-world data analysis revealed that SGLT2i-treated group had a lower incidence of hospitalized patients for non-rheumatic aortic valve disease compared to SU-treated group.

ConclusionsOur data identify SIRT1 as a key regulator of fibro-calcific processes in AS and suggest that SGLT2i may slow the aortic valve degeneration through SIRT1 modulation. These findings highlight SGLT2i as a promising therapeutic option for AS prevention and care.

"ExoY is a nucleotidyl cyclase, secreted by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa type 3 secretion system (T3SS), which generates various cyclic nucleotides within host cells, predominantly cGMP. How ExoY-catalyzed cNMPs production contributes to the infection process remains unclear. Using recombinant P. aeruginosa strains expressing ExoY variants with different substrate specificities, we identified that ExoY-derived cGMP modulates the cytotoxicity of ExoT, a co-injected T3SS exotoxin. Our results demonstrated that dephosphorylation of the host CrkII adaptor protein, a downstream effect of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of ExoT, is limited by ExoY-derived cGMP, therefore antagonizing ExoT-induced cell retraction. We also revealed a reciprocal interaction between T3SS effectors, showing that ExoT and ExoS, can in turn, suppress ExoY activity and its production of cGMP in certain cell types, thereby limiting their regulation by ExoY-synthesized cGMP. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between T3SS effectors and uncover a novel host cell-dependent regulation within P. aeruginosa infections."
"Quantitative analysis of microbial growth curves is essential for understanding how bacterial populations respond to environmental cues. Traditional analysis approaches make parametric assumptions about the functional form of these curves, limiting their usefulness for studying conditions that distort standard growth curves. In addition, modern robotics platforms enable the high-throughput collection of large volumes of growth data, thus requiring strategies that can analyze large-scale growth data in a flexible and efficient manner. Here, we introduce DGrowthR, a statistical R and standalone app frame-work for the integrative analysis of large growth experiments. DGrowthR comprises methods for data pre-processing and standardization, exploratory functional data analysis, and non-parametric modeling of growth curves using Gaussian Process regression. Importantly, DGrowthR includes a rigorous statistical testing framework for differential growth analysis. To illustrate the range of application scenarios of DGrowthR, we analyzed three large-scale bacterial growth datasets that tackle distinct scientific questions. On an in-house large-scale growth dataset comprising two pathogens that were subjected to a large chemical perturbation screen, DGrowthR enabled the discovery of compounds with significant growth inhibitory effects as well as compounds that induce non-canonical growth dynamics. We also re-analyzed two publicly available datasets and recovered reported adjuvants and antagonists of antibiotic activity, as well as bacterial genetic factors that determine susceptibility to specific antibiotic treatments. We anticipate that DGrowthR will streamline the analysis of modern high-volume growth experiments, enabling researchers to gain novel biological insights in a standardized and reproducible manner."
"Allogeneic bone marrow and umbilical cord stem cell transplants often provide the best hope for curing many patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and over 70 other diseases. Matching patients to unrelated donors requires flexible and timely searches as matching criteria change. Matching systems should scale to accommodate the diversity in patient and donor typing resolution and the growing number of donors.

We developed GraphMatch (GM), a scalable graph database solution for storing and searching variable-resolution HLA genotype markers. As a test set, we expanded the World Marrow Donor Association (WMDA) validation set based on the IPD-IMGT/HLA Database version 2.16 to create a synthetic production data set of 1 million patients and 10 million donors.

Single-patient identity search times range from 218.5 milliseconds per patient for 2 million donors to 1201.4 milliseconds per patient for 10 million donors. Search performance timing remained linear with the number of edges, even at a production scale.

In general, GM demonstrates the usefulness of graph databases as a flexible platform for scalable matching solutions."
"Embryonic exposures to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been linked to preterm birth, neural tube closure defects, abnormal enteric innervation, and craniofacial malformations, potentially due to disrupted neural tube or neural crest (NC) cell development. Naproxen (NPX), a common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and inflammation, exerts its effects through non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. Our lab has identified that the cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) isoenzymes are expressed during the early stages of vertebrate embryonic development, and that global inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 function disrupts NC cell migration and differentiation in Ambystoma mexicanum (axolotl) embryos. NC cells differentiate into various adult tissues including craniofacial cartilage, bone, and neurons in the peripheral and enteric nervous systems. To investigate the specific phenotypic and molecular effects of NPX exposure on NC development and differentiation, and to identify molecular links between COX inhibition and NC derivative anomalies, we exposed late neurula and early tailbud stage axolotl embryos to various concentrations of NPX and performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for markers of migratory and differentiating NC cells. Our results reveal that NPX exposure impairs the migration of SOX9+ NC cells, leading to abnormal development of craniofacial cartilage structures, including Meckels cartilage in the jaw. NPX exposure also alters the expression of markers associated with peripheral and central nervous system (PNS and CNS) development, suggesting concurrent neurodevelopmental changes."
"ImportanceNumerous studies indicate that the traditional categorical classification of severe mental disorders (SMD), such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and major depressive disorders, does not align with the underlying biology of those disorders as they frequently overlap in terms of symptoms and risk factors.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to identify transdiagnostic patient clusters based on disease severity and explore the underlying biological mechanisms independently of the traditional categorical classification.

DesignWe utilized data from 443 participants diagnosed with SMD of the PsyCourse Study, a longitudinal study with deep phenotyping across up to four visits. We performed longitudinal clustering to group patients based on symptom trajectories and cognitive performance. The resulting clusters were compared on cross-sectional variables, including independent measures of severity as well as polygenic risk scores, serum protein quantification, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation.

ResultsWe identified two distinct clusters of patients that exhibited marked differences in illness severity but did not differ significantly in age, sex, or diagnostic proportions. We found 19 serum proteins significantly dysregulated between the two clusters. Functional enrichment pointed to a convergence of immune system dysregulation and neurodevelopmental processes.

ConclusionThe observed differences in serum protein expression suggest that disease severity is associated with the convergence of immune system dysregulation and neurodevelopmental alterations, particularly involving pathways related to inflammation and brain plasticity. The identification of pro-inflammatory proteins among the differentially expressed markers underscores the potential role of systemic inflammation in the pathophysiology of SMD. These results highlight the importance of considering illness severity as a core dimension in psychiatric research and clinical practice and suggest that targeting immune-related mechanisms may offer promising new therapeutic avenues for patients with SMD.

Key points

QuestionCan analyzing symptom trajectories and cognitive profiles across diagnostic categories reveal clinically relevant subgroups in severe mental disorders?

FindingsIn this longitudinal study of 443 individuals with severe mental disorders, two distinct clusters emerged, differing significantly in illness severity, with the more severe group displaying elevated pro-inflammatory serum proteins, suggesting an association between disease severity and inflammation.

MeaningThese findings suggest that transdiagnostic clustering clarifies shared mechanisms, underscores the importance of inflammation in severe mental disorders, and highlights a promising avenue for novel therapeutic approaches."
"BackgroundHighly repetitive tandem repeat arrays, known as satellite DNAs, are frequently found in low recombination regions such as centromeres. Satellite arrays often contain complex internal structures known as higher order repeats (HORs) that may have functional significance. Maize is unusual in having satellites in two different genomic contexts: centromeres, which interact with kinetochore proteins, and knobs, which are subject to meiotic drive when abnormal chromosome 10 is present. Whether HOR patterns exist in maize centromeres or knobs and how the patterns might relate to function is unknown.

ResultsHere, we generated 13 repeat-sensitive genome assemblies of maize and its recent ancestor, teosinte. We developed a local, binned approach to categorize HORs. Our findings reveal that HORs are ubiquitous in maize, but are generally low-frequency with small patterns, rather than the large, continuous HOR blocks found in humans and Arabidopsis. While centromeric CentC arrays contain majority HOR content, some of which is conserved in teosinte, the patterns are primarily locally-confined and unrelated to the active centromeres, as marked by Centromeric Histone H3. Knobs, on the other hand, have a more active HOR landscape. Large knobs contain megabase-scale repeat units, or similarity blocks, with conserved HORs. The large-scale repeat units may facilitate unequal crossing over events that enable rapid expansion, and possibly contain functional motifs that are recognized by trans-acting factors that mediate meiotic drive.

ConclusionsHORs are present in all satellites in maize. HOR content is not associated with centromere function, but knobs contain conserved HOR patterns within similarity blocks that may facilitate meiotic drive."
"Inner ear organoid development--from germ layer to otocyst formation--relies on timed chemical cues to recapitulate major signals in vivo. In contrast, later stages of differentiation--from otic vesicle (OV) to organoid formation--are self-guided, even though these stages are modulated by several key morphogens in vivo. We sought to elucidate additional morphogens that might improve culture efficiency and influence cell fate decisions. Using a whole-transcriptomic approach, we identified major differences in native and stem cell-derived OVs related to anterior-posterior patterning and retinoic acid (RA) signaling. Increasing the level of RA during OV formation in these cultures modulated organoid efficiency, increased nonsensory markers, decreased sensory markers, and decreased hair cell production. The organoid culture platform mimics the exquisite RA sensitivity found in normal inner ear development and may help identify RA-responsive genes driving organogenesis and cell fate specification."
"Unbiased classification of equine dendritic cells (DC) is necessary to address various research questions such as the role of DC subsets in immune-mediated diseases of horses. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on DC enriched from blood of two horses, based on expression of CD172a, Flt3, CADM1 and CD14. All main DC subsets were detected based on key gene expression, including cDC type 1 (cDC1; XCR1), cDC2 (FCER1A, CD1E) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC; TCF4). In addition, we detected a small cluster of CD34-expressing DC progenitors. Our data confirms the previously reported phenotype of equine pDC (MHC-IIlowCADM1intCD172aint), cDC1 (MHC-IIhighCADM1highCD172alow-int) and cDC2 (MHC-IIhighCADM1intCD172ahigh), while also highlighting considerable CD14 expression for cDC2. Among Flt3+ cells clustering with cDC2, we identified a cluster resembling monocytes and showing a highly pro-inflammatory signature, likely representing DC type 3 (DC3). Notably, one cDC2-associated cluster had a mixed pDC/cDC2 signature (TCF4, SPIB, FCER1A), indicating the presence of transitional DC (tDC), a new DC subset initially described in human and mouse, and more recently in pig. To assess cross-species conservation of DC subsets, we compared equine and porcine DC scRNA-seq datasets using SATURN, a deep learning method that combines gene expression with added biological knowledge encoded in protein language models. This enabled mapping of the most similar DC subsets between horse and pig, confirming the conservation of key transcriptomic features and supporting the identification of equine tDC. Our atlas of equine blood DC is a valuable resource for comparative analyses, and it forms the foundation for elucidating the role of DC subsets in immunological diseases such as type I hypersensitivity in horses."
"Inhibitory interneurons in the cortex are classified into cell types differing in their morphology, electrophysiology, and connectivity. Although it is known that parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing neurons (VIP), the major inhibitory neuron subtypes in the cortex, have distinct modulatory effects on excitatory neurons, how heterogeneous spatial connectivity properties relate to network computations is not well understood. Here, we study the implications of heterogeneous inhibitory neurons on the dynamics and computations of spatially-structured neural networks. We develop a mean-field model of the system in order to systematically examine excitation-inhibition balance, dynamical stability, and cell-type specific gain modulations. The model incorporates three inhibitory cell types and excitatory neurons with distinct connectivity probabilities and recent evidence of long-range spatial projections of SST neurons. Position-dependent firing rate predictions are validated against simulations, and balanced solutions under Gaussian assumptions are derived from scaling arguments. Stability analysis shows that while long-range inhibitory projections in E-I circuits with a homogeneous inhibitory population result in instability, the heterogeneous network maintains stability with long-range SST projections. This suggests that a mixture of short and long-range inhibitions may be key to providing diverse computations while maintaining stability. We further find that conductance-based synaptic transmissions are necessary to reproduce experimentally observed cell-type-specific gain modulations of inhibition by PV and SST neurons. The mechanisms underlying cell-type-specific gain changes are elucidated using linear response theory. Our theoretical approach offers insight into the computational function of cell-type-specific and distance-dependent network structure."
"The Gal4/UAS system is used across model organisms to overexpress target genes in precise cell types and relies on generating transgenic Gal4 driver lines. In zebrafish, the Tg(elavl3:KalTA4) (HuC) Gal4 line drives robust expression in neurons. We observed an increased prevalence of swim bladder defects in Tg(elavl3:KalTA4) zebrafish larvae compared to wildtype siblings, which prompted us to investigate whether transgenic larvae display additional neurobehavioral phenotypes. Tg(elavl3:KalTA4) larvae showed alterations in brain activity, brain morphology, and behavior, including increased hindbrain size and reduced activity of the cerebellum. Bulk RNA-seq analysis revealed dysregulation of the transcriptome and suggested an increased ratio of neuronal progenitor cells compared to differentiated neurons. To understand whether these phenotypes derive from Gal4 toxicity or from positional effects related to transgenesis, we used economical low-pass whole genome sequencing to map the Tol2-mediated insertion site to chromosome eight. Reduced expression of the neighboring gene gadd45ga, a known cell cycle regulator, is consistent with increased proliferation and suggests a role for positional effects. Challenges with creating alternative pan-neuronal lines include the length of the elavl3 promoter (over 8 kb) and random insertion using traditional transgenesis methods. To facilitate the generation of alternative lines, we cloned five neuronal promoters (atp6v0cb, smaller elavl3, rtn1a, sncb, and stmn1b) ranging from 1.7 kb to 4.3 kb and created KalTA4 lines using Tol2 and the phiC31 integrase-based pIGLET system. Our study highlights the importance of using appropriate genetic controls and interrogating potential positional effects in new transgenic lines.

ARTICLE SUMMARYThe Gal4/UAS system is a genetic tool that allows researchers to overexpress specific genes in specific cell types by pairing a Gal4 ""driver"" line with a UAS ""reporter"" line. In zebrafish, more than 500 transgenic Gal4 lines have been generated using transgenesis methods that insert DNA into random sites in the genome. Here, the authors report that a pan-neuronal Gal4 zebrafish line, Tg(elavl3:KalTA4), has neurobehavioral phenotypes, including changes in brain activity, brain structure, and behavior. These findings emphasize the importance of using appropriate controls and highlight the utility of methods for targeted transgenesis."
"Restoration efforts aim to reestablish grassland cover and maintain ecosystem services. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of the effects of grassland restoration options on integrated biodiversity, carbon, ecosystem function, and climate feedbacks. Through a multi-year grassland restoration experiment in a tallgrass prairie site in Nebraska, USA, we investigated how different management practices affected biodiversity, productivity and the surface-atmosphere feedbacks using a combination of in situ measurements and airborne hyperspectral and thermal remote sensing. Our findings suggested that certain management treatments altered species diversity, productivity and energy balance. Higher diversity plots had higher vegetation cover, albedo, canopy water content and lower surface temperature, indicating clear effects of management treatments on grassland ecosystem processes influencing surface-atmosphere feedbacks of mass and energy. The coherent responses of multiple airborne remote sensing indices illustrate clear co-benefits of grassland restoration practices that enhance ecosystem productivity and biodiversity and mitigate climate change through surface atmosphere feedbacks, offering a new strategy to address the global challenges of biodiversity loss and climate change in prairie ecosystems."
"Iron (Fe) is essential for plant development throughout the life cycle. Rosette leaves are responsive to Fe supply in Arabidopsis thaliana. Little is known about the dynamics of Fe deficiency (-Fe) responses of rosette leaves during the reproductive stages. We studied the dynamics of Fe-dependent responses at four consecutive reproductive stages (rosette, bolting, flowering, mature silique stages, hereby named RS, BS, FS, MS). We examined the growth of rosette leaves, elemental contents and gene expression patterns of Fe homeostasis genes belonging to differently regulated groups. We determined individual leaf sizes during seven days of +Fe and -Fe treatment at the RS. Young leaves responded to -Fe with growth inhibition and yellowing. Old and young leaves differed in gene expression patterns and elemental contents. Differences were noted between the early and late reproductive stages (primarily RS and BS versus MS) and correlations between ionomic contents and gene expression were detected. All leaves had induced Fe recycling genes at -Fe.

Our findings highlight a developmental stage-dependent modulation of +Fe and -Fe responses in leaves. We discuss possible leaf signaling mechanisms accounting for the distinct responses between old and young leaves. This insight is informative to strengthen our understanding on plant iron management.

Highlight/ One-sentence summaryThis study explores reproductive stage-dependent responses of rosette leaves to iron availability, revealing distinct growth, elemental contents, and gene expression patterns between young and old leaves and stages."
"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels and the main mediators of synaptic neurotransmission in the insect brain. In insects, nAChRs are pivotal for sensory processing, cognition and motor control, and are the primary target of neonicotinoid insecticides. Neonicotinoids are potent neurotoxins and pollinators such as honey bees are more sensitive and affected by extremely low sub-lethal doses. The pentameric nAChR channel is made up either of five -subunits constituting five ligand-binding sites or a mixture of two to three  and {beta} subunits constitute two to three ligand-binding sites. Of particular note, the honey bee nAChR8 subunit is converted into a {beta} subunit (nAChR{beta}2) in Drosophila, raising the question whether this  to {beta} conversion makes flies less sensitive to neonicotinoids. To investigate species-specific aspects of neonicotinoid toxicity we CRISPR-Cas9 engineered a cross-species chimeric nAChR subunit by swapping the ligand-binding domain in Drosophila of nAChR{beta}2 with honey bee nAChR8. Toxicity assessment by neonicotinoid thiamethoxam revealed significantly impaired motor functions in climbing and flight assays when comparing the 8/{beta}2 chimeric channel to wild type or a {beta}2 knock-out. However, both the 8/{beta}2 chimeric channel and the {beta}2 knock-out showed the same increased survival after neonicotinoid exposure compared to wild type flies. Combinatorial exposure to neonicotinoids also did not reveal differences. These findings highlight the critical role of nAChR subunit composition in motor control and demonstrate how subtle structural differences can profoundly impact motor function and pesticide response, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity across species."
"Neuropathic pain is characterized by mechanical allodynia and thermal (heat and cold) hypersensitivity, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study examines the role of inhibitory interneurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in modulating pain perception following nerve injury. Chemogenetic excitation of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons significantly alleviated mechanical allodynia but had minimal effects on thermal hypersensitivity. However, inhibition of PV+ interneurons did not produce significant changes in pain sensitivity, suggesting that reductions in perisomatic inhibition do not contribute to chronic pain states. In contrast, bidirectional modulation of somatostatin-positive (SST+) interneurons influenced pain perception in a modality-specific manner. Both excitation and inhibition of SST+ interneurons alleviated mechanical allodynia, indicating a potential compensatory role in nociceptive processing. Additionally, SST+ neuron excitation reduced cold hypersensitivity without affecting heat hypersensitivity, whereas inhibition improved heat hypersensitivity but not cold responses. These findings suggest that, in addition to PV+ neurons, SST+ interneurons in the BLA play a complex role in modulating neuropathic pain following nerve injury and may serve as a potential target for future neuromodulation interventions in chronic pain management."
"O_LIThe latitudinal gradient (LG) hypothesis predicts a poleward decrease of genetic diversity. Similarly, the central-marginal hypothesis (CMH) predicts higher genetic diversity in range centres than margins. We examined these patterns in Europe (EU), North America (NA) and East Asia (EA), which experienced contrasting patterns of landscape fragmentation.
C_LIO_LIWe compiled genetic variation data for 445 plant species and 8,530 populations. We calculated ecological metrics comprising distance to the range margin and native climatic niche margin, distance to refugia, latitude and altitude. We applied Bayesian inference to evaluate the relationships between genetic variation and ecological metrics.
C_LIO_LIWe found universal support for the CMH, with populations at the centres of species ranges and/or native climatic niches exhibiting higher genetic diversity than those at the margins and stronger patterns in woody versus herbaceous plants. Evidence for a LG in diversity was less consistent with latitude: negatively correlated with genetic diversity in EU, positively correlated in EA, and no correlation in NA.
C_LIO_LIOur analysis supports the view that the LG is largely driven by latitudinal trends in glaciation, particularly in EU, but highlights that glaciation patterns and their resulting impacts on landscape genetic diversity were more heterogeneous in NA and EA.

"AbstractMany proteins are highly flexible and their ability to adapt their shape can be fundamental to their functional properties. We can now computationally predict a single, static protein structure with high accuracy. However, we are not yet able to reliably predict structural flexibility. A major factor limiting such predictions is the scarcity of suitable training data. Here, we focus on predicting the structural flexibility of the functionally important antibody and T-cell receptor CDR3 loops. We extracted a dataset of CDR3 like loop motifs from the PDB to create ALL-conformations, a dataset containing 1.2 million structures and more than 100,000 unique sequences. Using this dataset, we develop ITsFlexible a method classifying CDR3 flexibility, which outperforms all alternative approaches on our crystal structure datasets and successfully generalises to MD simulations. We also used ITsFlexible to predict the flexibility of three completely novel CDRH3 loops and experimentally determined their conformations using cryo-EM."
"Older adults exhibit larger individual differences in walking ability and cognitive function than young adults. Characterizing intrinsic brain connectivity differences in older adults across a wide walking performance spectrum may provide insight into the mechanisms of functional decline in some older adults and resilience in others. Thus, the objectives of this study were to: (1) determine whether young adults and high- and low-functioning older adults show group differences in brain network segregation, and (2) determine whether network segregation is associated with working memory and walking function in these groups. The analysis included 21 young adults and 81 older adults. Older adults were further categorized according to their physical function using a standardized assessment; 54 older adults had low physical function while 27 were considered high functioning. Structural and functional resting state magnetic resonance images were collected using a Siemens Prisma 3T scanner. Working memory was assessed with the NIH Toolbox list sorting test. Walking speed was assessed with a 400 m-walk test at participants self-selected speed. We found that network segregation in mobility-related networks (sensorimotor, vestibular) was higher in older adults with higher physical function compared to older adults with lower physical function. There were no group differences in laterality effects on network segregation. We found multivariate associations between working memory and walking speed with network segregation scores. The interaction of left sensorimotor network segregation and age groups was associated with higher working memory function. Higher left sensorimotor, left vestibular, right anterior cingulate cortex, and interaction of left anterior cingulate cortex network segregation and age groups were associated with faster walking speed. These results are unique and significant because they demonstrate higher network segregation is largely related to higher physical function and not age alone.

HighlightsO_LIOlder adults with high and low physical function have network segregation differences.
C_LIO_LINetwork segregation for high-functioning older adults was more similar to that of young adults.
C_LIO_LILaterality of functional network segregation is not different between age groups.
C_LIO_LIHigher network segregation is associated with faster walking speed.

"BackgroundDespite its clinical promise in non-solid tumor, immunotherapy is yet to show significant clinical efficacy for brain tumors including pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG). This indicated the need to fully explore DMG immune tumor microenvironment (TME).

MethodWhole brains (49 DMGs, 20 non-DMG, 10 non-malignant) from 79 pediatric patients were used to establish a tissue microarray (918 cores) representing primary, metastatic, and adjacent healthy sites. CellDIVE MxIF multiplex assay was used to probe for 33 immune and cell type markers. RNA sequencing (n=62 patients) defined additional immune signatures. Findings were validated using patient plasma and DMG PDX models. Our annotated single-cell atlas was used to train a spatial AI model to predict antigens from H&E staining.

FindingsWe found enrichment of M1-activated microglia in primary versus adjacent healthy tissue. PD1 positive cells were significantly (p<0.01) higher in tumor compared to adjacent controls. This was validated by mRNA profiling, further indicating two distinct groups with top 35 significant (p<0.05) genes revealing synaptic signature in the metastatic cohort.

We stratified the patient cohort by treatment. Imipridone cohort (n=5) showed decreased progenitor (Nestin+, Vimentin+, and SOX2+) and increased macrophages/microglia infiltration. Increased T and B cells was validated in patient plasma following imipridone therapy. Combination therapy of imipridone and immunotherapy (n=7) resulted in increased myeloid (Iba1, CD68, CD163) and lymphoid (CD3, CD8) cells. Enhanced immune engagement was validated in DMG PDX models. Machine learning resulted in a spatial AI model capable of predicting 22 antigens using H&E slides.

InterpretationsDMG tumors maintain a cold immune microenvironment, which is nevertheless dynamic and responsive to therapy, indicating the need to explore combination therapies. AI-assisted antigen detection is suitable for rapid interpretation of clinical biospecimens.

"Auditory processing in the cerebral cortex is considered to begin with thalamocortical inputs to layer 4 (L4) of the primary auditory cortex (A1). In this canonical model, A1 L4 inputs initiate a hierarchical cascade, with higher-order cortices receiving pre-processed information for the slower integration of complex sounds. Here, we identify alternative ascending pathways in mice that bypass A1 and directly reach multiple layers of the secondary auditory cortex (A2), indicating parallel activation of these areas alongside sequential information processing. We found that L6 of both A1 and A2 receive short-latency (<10 ms) sound inputs, comparable in speed to the canonical A1 L4 input but transmitted through higher-order thalamic nuclei. Additionally, A2 L4 is innervated by a caudal subdivision within the traditionally defined primary thalamus, which we now identify as belonging to the non-primary system. Notably, both thalamic regions receive projections from distinct subdivisions of the higher-order inferior colliculus, which in turn are directly innervated by cochlear nucleus neurons. These findings reveal alternative ascending pathways reaching A2 at L4 and L6 via secondary subcortical structures. Thus, higher-order auditory cortex processes both slow, pre-processed information and rapid, direct sensory inputs, enabling parallel and distributed processing of fast sensory information across cortical areas."
"Water-use contributes significantly to plant growth and productivity, yet the extent to which variation in water-use is a function of adaptive differentiation is unknown. Here, we studied natural variation of water use in Arabidopsis thaliana to understand how climatic history impacts water use strategies. We performed a survey of vegetative water use (VWU) and life-history traits across A. thaliana ecotypes in controlled and outdoor settings. Performance of select ecotypes in controlled experiments was reflective of performance in outdoor conditions. Through trait-climate and genome-wide association (GWAS) analyses, we tested for signals of environmental adaption in water use. Ecotypes from warmer environments were noted in displaying enhanced water use, independent of precipitation. GWAS identified MYB59 as a determiner of VWU. Functionally significant MYB59 SNPs showed associations with temperature, but not precipitation, and myb59 mutants demonstrated reduced water use under high temperatures. Our study suggests intraspecific variation in water-use can be explained in part by climatic history, where temperature is the most significant driver. MYB59 appears involved in this association and holds promise for study in crops."
"Large epidemiological impacts resulting from disease vector control interventions are typically associated with significant disruption of vector populations. While vector density is a frequently measured response, impacts on demography and connectivity are suspected but rarely quantified. We analysed low-coverage whole-genome sequence data of 893 Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes collected between 2014-2015 during a cluster-randomized control trial (cRCT) in Burkina Faso to compare a pyrethroid-only net (ITN) with a pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen (ITN-PPF) net. Despite reductions of clinical malaria by 12%, and vector density by 22% in the ITN-PPF arm, we found no significant changes in An. gambiae population genetic structure or diversity. We found remarkably low population differentiation, and a lack of discernible clustering by treatment, time, or space. Nucleotide diversity and inbreeding coefficient remained stable between treatments, and genome-wide scans showed no putative signatures of selection between trial arms. These results show that ITN-PPF did not alter An. gambiae genetic structure, possibly due to large, vagile populations in West Africa. More widely, this is first evidence that epidemiologically meaningful reductions in vector density may not impact genetic diversity or connectivity, and challenges what constitutes adequate vector control in large populations."
"Global university rankings have transformed how certain institutions define success, often elevating metrics over meaning. This study examines universities with rapid research growth that suggest metric-driven behaviors. Among the 1,000 most publishing institutions, 98 showed extreme output increases between 2018-2019 and 2023-2024. Of these, 18 were selected for exhibiting sharp declines in first and corresponding authorship. Compared to national, regional, and international norms, these universities (in India, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) display patterns consistent with strategic metric optimization. Key findings include publication growth of up to 965%, concentrated in STEM fields; surges in hyper-prolific authors and highly cited articles; and dense internal co-authorship and citation clusters. The group also exhibited elevated shares of publications in delisted journals and high retraction rates. These patterns illustrate vulnerabilities in global ranking systems, as metrics lose meaning when treated as targets (Goodharts Law) and institutions emulate high-performing peers under competitive pressure (institutional isomorphism). Without reform, rankings may continue incentivizing behaviors that distort scholarly contribution and compromise research integrity."
"The estimation of full-field displacement between biological image frames or in videos is important for quantitative analyses of motion, dynamics and biophysics. However, the often weak signals, poor biological contrast and a multitude of noise processes typical to microscopy make this a formidable challenge for many contemporary methods. Here, we present a deep-learning method, termed Displacement Estimation FOR Microscopy (DEFORM-Net), that outperforms traditional digital image correlation and optical flow methods, as well as recent learned approaches, offering simultaneous high accuracy, spatial sampling and speed. DEFORM-Net is experimentally unsupervised, relying on displacement simulation based on a random fractal Perlin-noise process and optimised training loss functions, without the need for experimental ground truth. We demonstrate its performance on real biological videos of beating neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes and pulsed contractions in Drosophila pupae, and in various microscopy modalities. We provide DEFORM-Net as open source, including inference in the ImageJ/FIJI platform, for rapid evaluation, which will empower new quantitative applications in biology and medicine."
"Environmental toxicants such as heavy metals can profoundly impact organismal physiology, yet sensitive and rapid behavioral assays to quantify such effects are limited. Here, we employed a microfluidic-based electrotaxis assay to systematically evaluate the impact of chronic exposure to metal salts on the electrotactic swimming behavior of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We report that exposure to Ag, Hg, MeHg, Cu, Mn, and Pb significantly alters electrotaxis speed. Notably, Cu required higher concentrations to induce phenotypes, whereas Ag and Hg disrupted behavior at lower doses. Three other metals (Ni, Fe, and Cd) did not elicit marked electrotaxis defects. Bioaccumulation analysis of Cu, Ag, Hg, and MeHg via ICP-MS revealed that MeHg was present in highest amount in worms. Consistent with this, MeHg showed the highest toxicity. We also found dopaminergic neurodegeneration in most metal-exposed animals, correlating with behavioral impairments. Although heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1) and its downstream target hsp-16.2 were induced by some metals, their expression did not consistently correlate with electrotaxis defects. Moreover, metal-induced impairments persisted even after recovery on toxin-free media, indicating possible irreversible damage. Our findings establish electrotaxis in C. elegans as a robust, non-invasive assay to assess neurobehavioral toxicity and demonstrate its utility for detecting sub-lethal impacts of environmental metals."
"A novel class of protein assembly modulator chemical compounds that exhibit broad anti-tumor cytotoxicity has been recently described. Here we present a more detailed structure-activity-relationship exploration of the chemical series. PAV-0805, an advanced analog, was found to be safe in mice at 10mg/kg and nontoxic to normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cells. PAV-0805 has demonstrated broad anti-cancer activity in the NCI-60 cell lines, including against a diversity of brain, breast, colon, lung, ovarian prostate, renal, and skin cancers, and leukemias. In the aggressive 4T1 mouse allograft breast cancer model, PAV-0805 was effective in reducing tumor growth and metastasis when treatment was initiated early (primary tumor volume of 50mm3) or late (primary tumor volume of 500mm3), and under both treatment conditions showed inhibition of both tumor growth and metastasis comparable to paclitaxel. The novel multi-protein complex targeted by these compounds is enriched in gene products involved in the cancer hallmarks of resisting cell death and reprogramming energy metabolism."
"Developing biofilms of the gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium Bacillus subtilis exhibit expression patterns and evolutionary imprints similar to those observed in eukaryotic embryos. However, the universality of these evolutionary and developmental regularities has not yet been explored in other biofilm-forming bacteria, including pathogens. To broaden the perspective on ontogeny-phylogeny correlations in bacteria, we recovered phylotranscriptomic and phyloproteomic trajectories throughout the entire biofilm development of uropathogenic Escherichia coli UTI89. Here, we show that biofilm growth in E. coli UTI89 positively correlates with the evolutionary age of expressed genes, with developing biofilms progressively expressing younger and more divergent genes. These findings suggest that biofilm formation in gram-negative bacteria is not macroevolutionarily naive and that evolutionary imprints are a pervasive feature of bacterial biofilm development. While these regularities apply to the developmental expression patterns of bulk biofilms, the question remains whether evolutionary stratification occurs within the spatial regions of individual biofilms. To address this, we analyzed expression profiles across concentric regions of E. coli UTI89 biofilms at three developmental stages. This analysis revealed that gene expression, functional patterns, and evolutionary imprints are influenced by both developmental timing and distance from the biofilm center. Together, these findings demonstrate that the growth of uropathogenic E. coli biofilms is governed by both temporal and spatial macroevolutionary logic, drawing intriguing parallels to organismal development in multicellular eukaryotic lineages."
"ObjectiveMotivational dysfunction is a core feature of depression, and can have debilitating effects on everyday function. However, it is unclear which disrupted cognitive processes underlie impaired motivation, and whether impairments persist following remission. Decision-making concerning exerting effort to obtain rewards offers a promising framework for understanding motivation, especially when examined with computational tools which can offer precise quantification of latent processes.

MethodsEffort-based decision-making was assessed using the Apple Gathering Task, in which participants decide whether to exert effort via a grip-force device to obtain varying levels of reward; effort levels were individually calibrated and varied parametrically. We present a comprehensive computational analysis of decision-making, initially validating our model in healthy volunteers (N=67), before applying it in a case-control study including current (N=41) and remitted (N=46) unmedicated depressed individuals, and healthy volunteers with (N=36) and without (N=57) a family history of depression.

ResultsFour fundamental computational mechanisms that drive patterns of effort-based decisions, which replicated across samples, were identified: overall bias to accept effort challenges; reward sensitivity; and linear and quadratic effort sensitivity. Traditional model-agnostic analyses showed that both depressed groups showed lower willingness to exert effort. In contrast with previous findings, computational analysis revealed that this difference was primarily driven by lower effort acceptance bias, but not altered effort or reward sensitivity.

ConclusionsThis work provides insight into the computational mechanisms underlying motivational dysfunction in depression. Lower willingness to exert effort could represent a trait-like factor contributing to symptoms, and might represent a fruitful target for treatment and prevention."
"While scientists argue what aging is and what drives aging, it is widely accepted that our face changes drastically with age and that mortality increases in late life. We hypothesize that people of the same age can be biologically older than others and that the human face may reflect accelerated molecular aging. To test this hypothesis we examine the associations of face photo-based age acceleration with mortality and lifestyle. For this purpose, we trained and tested artificial intelligence models on 442,110 photos of famous people. We found that face photo-based age predicts all-cause mortality for middle-aged and older individuals meaning that those age faster based on their face photo die sooner. We also found that, based on face photos, sport is the slowest aging occupation among famous people consistently to previous findings showing the benefits of exercise to epigenetic aging. Overall, we demonstrate that the face photo-base age model approaches biological age in some extent and provides a low-cost and fast complementary measurement for personalized medicine, as well as aging and rejuvenation studies. The model is available for demonstration and academic research purposes at https://photoage.sztaki.hu/."
"Degrons are short protein segments that target proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and thus ensure timely removal of signaling proteins and clearance of misfolded proteins from the intracellular space. Here, we describe a systematic screen for degrons in the human cytosol. We determine degron potency of >200,000 different 30-residue tiles from more than 5,000 cytosolic human proteins with 99.7% coverage. In total, 19.1% of the tiles function as strong degrons, 30.4% as intermediate degrons, while 50.5% did not display degron properties. The vast majority of the degrons are dependent on the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and the proteasome but independent of autophagy. The results reveal both known and novel degron motifs, both internal as well as at the C-terminus. Mapping the degrons onto protein structures, predicted by AlphaFold2, revealed that most of the degrons are located in buried regions, indicating that they only become active upon unfolding or misfolding. Training of a machine learning model allowed us to probe the degron properties further and predict the cellular abundance of missense variants that operate by forming degrons in exposed and disordered protein regions, thus providing a mechanism of pathogenicity for germline coding variants at such positions."
"Intratumoral glucose availability is linked considerably to tumor growth, immune evasion, and metastasis. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which glucose levels govern cellular and immune responses against tumors remain incompletely understood. Here, we explored the context of tumors of intersections between AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and cGAS-STING signaling, a key pathway initiating antitumor immunity. We unexpectedly found that AMPK activation robustly enhances cGAS-STING signaling within cancer and immune cells, which potently impacts melanoma and colorectal cell senescence, organoid apoptosis, and the infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Using classic or newly developed AMPK agonist Aldometanib, TBK1S511E/S511E knock-in (KI) mice, glucose metabolic modulator, as well as AMPK1/2 dKO melanoma, we demonstrated that dual sensing of intratumoral glucose and dsDNA integrated by the AMPK-TBK1 cascade is essential for initiating antitumor immunity and suppressing cancer progressions. Notably, novel AMPK agonists or intervening in glucose glycolysis by Lonidamine synergized effectively with STING agonists, substantially inhibiting melanoma growth. Therefore, these findings unravel a concise mechanism integrating glucose metabolism and innate DNA sensing into cancer cell fate and propose an effective therapeutic strategy to enhance antitumor immunity.

"The increasing demand for effective drug combinations has made drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction a critical task in modern pharmacology. While most existing research focuses on small-molecule drugs, the role of biotech drugs in complex disease treatments remains relatively unexplored. Biotech drugs, derived from biological sources, have unique molecular structures that differ significantly from those of small molecules, making their interactions more challenging to predict. This study introduces BSI-Net, a novel graph attention network-based deep learning framework that improves interaction prediction between biotech and small-molecule drugs. Experimental results demonstrate that BSI-Net outperforms existing methods in multi-class DDI prediction, achieving superior performance across various evaluation types, including micro, macro, and weighted assessments. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning and graph-based models in uncovering novel interactions between biotech and small-molecule drugs, paving the way for more effective combination therapies in drug discovery."
"Human protein kinases constitute a large superfamily of about 500 genes, historically classified into subfamilies based on phylogenetic relationship. However, many kinases remain unclassified. Phylogeny is typically based on multiple sequence alignments, and neglects the physico-chemical properties of residues at each position of the sequence. By incorporating these properties, we can gain deeper insights beyond basic alignments. Here we use, for the first time, a detailed physico-chemical description of kinases to identify class-specific structural regions, supporting an unsupervised classification method capable of classifying previously unlabeled kinases. This novel approach aligns with existing phylogeny-based classifications while offering refinements and enhanced accuracy. Ultimately, we use machine learning techniques to classify unlabeled kinases, validated by analyzing class-specific structural regions. This new classification approach goes beyond current rankings and can be applied to any type of protein, such as immunoglobulins and G protein-coupled receptors."
"Candida auris is associated with life-threatening invasive disease due to high level of drug resistance. We present a clinical case of C. auris multi-drug resistance development in a single patient acquired during antifungal treatment. Five isolates were prospectively recovered from a transplant patient receiving antifungal therapy over a one-year period. While isolates were initially only resistant to fluconazole, the terminal isolate became resistant to caspofungin and amphotericin B with significant increase in micafungin MIC. Sequencing of ERG11 and FKS1 genes identified mutations associated with fluconazole and echinocandin resistance in the multi-drug-resistant isolate, underscoring the threat of therapy-induced development of resistance."
"Efficient learning requires estimation of, and adaptation to, different forms of uncertainty. If uncertainty is caused by randomness in outcomes (noise), observed events should have less influence on beliefs, whereas if uncertainty is caused by a change in the process being estimated (volatility) the influence of events should increase. Previous work has demonstrated that humans respond appropriately to changes in volatility, but there is less evidence of a rational response to noise. Here, we test adaptation to variable levels of volatility and noise in human participants, using choice behaviour and pupillometry as a measure of the central arousal system. We find that participants adapt as expected to changes in volatility, but not to changes in noise. Using a Bayesian observer model, we demonstrate that participants are, in fact, adapting to estimated noise, but that their estimates are imprecise, leading them to misattribute it as volatility and thus to respond inappropriately."
"This article critiques a recent study by Lacava et al. (2024) that suggests the population of Podocnemis expansa has recovered in Brazil based on increased hatchling releases across 11 nesting areas. I present three main challenges to the study conclusions. Firstly, hatchling counts alone should not be used to assess population recovery. Secondly, the study failed to consider alternative hypotheses that could explain the observed increases, including changes in methods and effort over time. Lastly, the statistical analysis was flawed, specifically neglecting temporal autocorrelation and failing to distinguish between statistical significance and biological relevance. Reanalysis of the original data, accounting for temporal autocorrelation, revealed sustained increases in hatchlings released in only five of eleven areas, contradicting the original claim of increases in most areas. Furthermore, reanalysis suggests that methodological changes influenced results in at least one area. The study published by Lacava et al. (2024) requires correction to avoid ingenuous and potentially misleading conclusions and to more closely reflect the reality of 21st-century freshwater turtle conservation efforts."
"The nuclear receptor Constitutive Androstane Receptor (CAR/NR1i3) is known for regulating various liver functions, including detoxification, nutrient metabolism, and hepatocyte proliferation. While CAR activation has been previously linked to higher ploidy, the underlying mechanisms are not fully known. Here, we uncover a basal role for CAR in maintaining hepatocyte ploidy, such that CAR deletion increases the number of diploid (2c) hepatocytes with a concomitant reduction in tetraploid (4c) hepatocytes. We demonstrate that CAR controls the de novo dNTP synthesis by directly transactivating the Ribonucleotide reductase-M2 (RRM2) gene, which encodes the rate-limiting catalytic subunit of the enzyme, ribonucleotide reductase.

Further, we find that the ligand-dependent CAR activation is sufficient to induce several genes involved in the de novo dNTP synthesis pathways, resulting in higher hepatic dATP and dTTP levels within the liver. Importantly, overexpressing RRM2 levels in CAR knockouts led to increased DNA synthesis and tetraploid (4c) hepatocytes compared to the control mice. Taken together, these findings reveal that the CAR-mediated RRM2 regulation contributes towards DNA synthesis and thereby maintains hepatocyte ploidy."
"Epilepsy is one of the most common comorbidities in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Many patients with epilepsy as well as ASD experience disruptions in their sleep-wake cycle and exhibit daily rhythms in expression of symptoms. Chronic exposure to light at nighttime can disrupt sleep and circadian rhythms. Contactin associated protein-like 2 knockout (Cntnap2 KO) mice, a model for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy, exhibit sleep and circadian disturbances and seizure-like events. This study examines how chronic dim light at night (DLaN) exposure affects sleep architecture, EEG power spectra, and seizure activity in Cntnap2 KO and wildtype (WT) mice. Using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, male and female Cntnap2 KO and WT mice were exposed to DLaN (5 lux) for 2 or 6 weeks. EEG recordings were analyzed to assess sleep architecture, power spectrum, and seizure-like events. DLaN exposure delays the wake onset and disrupts sleep patterns in a sex-dependent manner, with females being more affected. DLaN significantly increased slow-wave activity (SWA, 0.5-4 Hz) in both WT and KO mice, indicating increased sleep pressure. Finally, we found that DLaN dramatically increased the frequency of seizure-like events in the Cntnap2 KO mice and even increased the occurrence rate in the WT mice. Spectral analysis of seizure-like events revealed increased theta power, suggesting the involvement of hippocampus. Chronic DLaN exposure disrupts sleep and increases seizure-like events in Cntnap2 KO mice, with sex-specific differences. These findings emphasize the potential risks of nighttime light exposure for individuals with ASD and epilepsy, reinforcing the need to manage light exposure to improve sleep quality and reduce seizure risk."
"Achieving large depth-of-field super-resolution imaging deep inside samples is often hindered by unknown aberrations and overlapping molecular signals in 3D single-molecule localization microscopy. Here, we present LUNAR, a blind localization method that simultaneously resolves overlapping molecular signals and corrects for aberrations using a neural-physics model. Through self-supervised learning on single-molecule data without requiring prior knowledge or accurate calibration, LUNAR synergistically optimizes a physical model with a neural network to estimate key physical parameters (e.g., 3D positions, photons, aberrations) of molecules. Its hybrid Transformer network effectively handles PSFs of varying sizes, achieving theoretically maximum localization precision of consecutive blinking events. Extensive simulations and experiments demonstrate that LUNAR consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, reducing localization error by up to sixfold in the presence of unknown aberrations and molecular overlaps, enabling high-fidelity whole-cell reconstruction of mitochondria, nucleus, and neuronal cytoskeleton at great depths."
"Pangenome collections are growing to hundreds of high-quality genomes. This necessitates scalable methods for constructing pangenome alignments that can incorporate newly-sequenced assemblies. We previously developed Mumemto, which computes maximal unique matches (multi-MUMs) across pangenomes using compressed indexing. In this work, we extend Mumemto by introducing two new partitioning and merging strategies. Both strategies enable highly parallel, memory efficient, and updateable computation of multi-MUMs. One of the strategies, called string-based merging, is also capable of conducting the merges in a way that follows the shape of a phylogenetic tree, naturally yielding the multi-MUM for the trees internal nodes as well as the root. With these strategies, Mumemto now scales to 474 human haplo-types, the only multi-MUM method able to do so. It also introduces a time-memory tradeoff that allows Mumemto to be tailored to more scenarios, including in resource-limited settings."
"Faithful replication of eukaryotic chromatin requires the CMG helicase to translocate directionally along single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) while unwinding double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and navigating nucleosomes. However, the mechanism by which CMG achieves processive translocation and deals with nucleosomal barriers remains incompletely understood. Here, using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations with ATP-driven conformational switching, we showed that asymmetric rotational transitions among four distinct ssDNA-binding states enable CMG to achieve directional translocation and DNA unwinding. We further demonstrated that the fork protection complex (Csm3/Tof1) and RPA enhance processivity through distinct mechanisms: Csm3/Tof1 grips the parental duplex to suppress backtracking, while RPA alleviates lagging-strand clogging. Upon nucleosome encounter, Csm3/Tof1 promoted partial unwrapping of the entry DNA, but further progression was energetically restricted near the nucleosomal dyad. The histone chaperone FACT lowered this barrier and simultaneously prevented inappropriate histone transfer to the lagging strand. Our results provide mechanistic insights into how the eukaryotic replisome coordinates helicase activity, nucleosome navigation, histone chaperon function, and histone recycling during eukaryotic DNA replication."
"BackgroundDeep Mutational Scanning (DMS) assays can systematically assess the effects of amino acid substitutions on protein function. While DMS datasets have been generated for many targets, they often suffer from incomplete variant coverage due to technical constraints, limiting their utility in variant interpretation and downstream analyses.

ResultsWe developed VEFill, a gradient boosting model for imputing missing DMS scores across protein domains. VEFill is trained on the Human Domainome 1 dataset, a large, standardized set of DMS experiments using a uniform stability-based assay, and integrates a broad set of additional biologically informative features including ESM-1v sequence embeddings, evolutionary conservation (EVE scores), amino acid substitution matrices, and physicochemical descriptors. The model achieved robust predictive performance (R2 = 0.64, Pearson r = 0.80). It also demonstrated reliable generalization to unseen proteins in other stability-based datasets, while showing weaker performance on activity-based assays. Per-protein models further confirmed VEFills effectiveness under limited-data conditions. A reduced two-feature version using only ESM-1v embeddings and mean DMS scores performed comparably to the full model, suggesting a computationally efficient alternative. However, true zeroshot prediction without positional context remains a challenge, particularly for functionally complex proteins.

ConclusionsVEFill offers an interpretable, scalable framework for DMS score imputation, especially effective in stability-focused and sparse-data settings. It enables systematic mutation prioritization and may support the design of efficient experimental libraries for variant effect studies."
"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCurrent electrophysiological approaches can track the activity of many neurons, yet it is usually unknown which cell-types or brain areas are being recorded without further molecular or histological analysis. Developing accurate and scalable algorithms for identifying the cell-type and brain region of recorded neurons is thus crucial for improving our understanding of neural computation. In this work, we develop a multimodal contrastive learning approach for neural data that can be fine-tuned for different downstream tasks, including inference of cell-type and brain location. We utilize this approach to jointly embed the activity autocorrelations and extracellular waveforms of individual neurons. We demonstrate that our embedding approach, Neuronal Embeddings via MultimOdal contrastive learning (NEMO), paired with supervised fine-tuning, achieves state-of-the-art cell-type classification for two opto-tagged datasets and brain region classification for the public International Brain Laboratory Brain-wide Map dataset. Our method represents a promising step towards accurate cell-type and brain region classification from electrophysiological recordings. The project page and code are available at https://ibl-nemo.github.io/."
"Cell differentiation towards neurons is accompanied by widespread changes in three-dimensional (3D) genome organization and gene expression. Nuclear RNAs (nucRNAs) have been proposed to be important regulators of such changes; however, the type, abundance, and functions of nucRNAs during neurodifferentiation remain largely unexplored. Here, we integrate multi-omic data generated in the frame of the Functional ANnoTation Of the Mammalian genome (FANTOM6) to chart 3D genome, RNA-DNA contactome, and transcriptome changes during in vitro differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells to neural stem cells and neurons. We find that most RNA-DNA contacts form between transcripts and their source gene; however, a group of intronic RNAs engages in chromatin contacts with distal loci on the same or on different chromosomes. We detect such trans-contacting intronic RNAs (TIRs) in all cell types profiled by FANTOM6, but most prominently in neurons, where TIRs are produced from highly expressed, neuron-specific, long (mean length: 400 kilobases, kb) protein-coding genes. In neurons, TIRs accumulate in the nucleus forming large clouds around their source loci, and they occasionally spread across the nucleus. TIRs engage in local and distal contacts with a set of genomic regions (named TIR-contacted regions or TIRCs) carrying much shorter (mean length: 30 kb) neuron-specific genes that become upregulated and move towards the nuclear center during neurodifferentiation, forming high-connectivity hubs. TIR source genes, and especially their introns, are strongly enriched in risk loci for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Notably, knockdown of a single TIR by antisense oligonucleotides leads to downregulation of multiple genes implicated in NDDs and of source genes of most other TIRs. We propose that TIRs orchestrate cell type-specific gene expression during neurodifferentiation and might be pathogenically linked to NDDs."
"In many taxa, levels of genetic diversity are observed to vary along their genome. The framework of background selection models this variation in terms of linkage to constrained sites, and recent applications have been able to explain a large portion of the variation in human genomes. However, these studies have also yielded conflicting results, stemming from two key limitations. First, existing models are inaccurate in the most critical region of parameter space (Nes [~] -1), where the reduction in diversity is sharpest. And second, they assume a constant population size over time. Here, we develop predictions for diversity under background selection based on the Hill-Robertson system of two-locus statistics, which allows for population size changes. We treat the joint effect of multiple selected loci independently, but we show that interference among them is well captured through local rescaling of mutation, recombination and selection in an iterative procedure that converges quickly. We further accommodate existing background selection theory to non-equilibrium demography, bridging the gap between weak and strong selection. Simulations show that our predictions are accurate over the entire range of selection coefficients. We characterize the temporal dynamics of linked selection under population size changes and demonstrate that patterns of diversity can be misinterpreted by other models. Specifically, biases due to the incorrect assumption of equilibrium carry over to downstream inferences of the distribution of fitness effects and deleterious mutation rate. Jointly modeling demography and linked selection therefore improves our understanding of the genomic landscape of diversity, which will help refine inferences of linked selection in humans and other species."
"Incomplete mapping of gene expression within human (epiphyseal) growth plates contributes to the challenges of diagnosing and treating patients with skeletal growth disorders. To address this issue, we applied spatially resolved transcriptomics to rare growth plate biopsies obtained from healthy adolescents. In addition to identifying novel markers of each zone of the human growth plate, spatial profiling revealed that the expression of genes associated with poorly understood growth disorders, including NKX3-2, SGMS2 and WNK4, is restricted to specific human growth plate zones. By elaborating on the low transcriptional activity of resting zone chondrocytes, we found that a subset of these cells exists in a functionally quiescent state in vivo, as determined by their predominantly nuclear mRNA, abundant heterochromatin, and ability to exit the G0 phase under specific conditions - features shared with skeletal stem cells in mouse growth plates. Additionally, we identified distinct and overlapping sub-populations of human resting zone chondrocytes; an exploration of their hierarchy determined that CHRDL2 and/or SFRP5-positive sub-populations are among the least quiescent resting zone cells. In summary, we generated the most comprehensive gene expression characterization of the human growth plate, which revealed novel zone-specific markers, new primary growth disorders, candidate pharmacological targets, and led us to uncover sub-populations of resting zone chondrocytes with features of quiescent stem cells. These results contribute to a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing human height and can facilitate improved diagnosis and treatment strategies of patients with skeletal growth disorders."
"A common approach for exploring pathway dysregulation in cancer involves the gene set or pathway analysis of tumor transcriptomic data. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of cancer gene set testing is limited by the fact that most gene set collections model gene activity in normal tissue, which can differ significantly from gene activity found within tumors. To address this challenge, we have developed a bioinformatics approach based on sparse principal component analysis (PCA) for optimizing existing gene set collections to reflect the pattern of gene activity in dysplastic tissue and have used this technique to optimize the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) Hallmark collection for 21 solid human cancers profiled via bulk RNA-seq by The Tumor Genome Atlas (TCGA). Demonstrating the biological utility of our approach, the average survival association of gene set members is improved after optimization for nearly all cancer types and Hallmark gene sets."
"DELLA proteins, members of the GRAS-domain family of transcriptional regulators, are critical for plant growth and development. They modulate transcription indirectly via interactions with hundreds of transcription factors. The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) triggers DELLA degradation, providing a mechanism by which plants can integrate developmental and environmental signals to regulate gene expression and optimize growth responses.

In agriculture, DELLA mutations have been instrumental in improving crop performance. Most modern wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties carry Rht-B1b or Rht-D1b alleles that encode DELLA proteins resistant to GA-mediated degradation, resulting in constitutive partial suppression of stem growth, a semi-dwarf stature and lodging resistance. However, these alleles also reduce nitrogen use efficiency and early vigour, limiting their utility in some environments. Understanding how DELLA proteins regulate growth and development is, therefore, critical for refining breeding strategies.

In this study, we identified the orthologous C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factors INDETERMINATE DOMAIN 5 (IDD5) in wheat and SEMI-DWARF 3 (SDW3) in barley (Hordeum vulgare) as positive regulators of stem and leaf expansion. Both IDD5 and SDW3 physically interact with, and act downstream of, DELLA proteins as key components of GA-mediated growth responses. Altered expression levels of GA biosynthesis genes suggest that IDD5 helps maintain GA homeostasis in addition to growth regulation.

Loss-of-function mutations in IDD5 and SDW3 confer a GA-insensitive semi-dwarf phenotype comparable to that of the Rht-D1b  Green Revolution allele, highlighting their potential as novel dwarfing alleles for cereal improvement.

Significance statementOur study identifies homologous wheat and barley transcription factors (IDD5 and SDW3) that interact with DELLA proteins to regulate plant height. Unlike conventional  Green Revolution DELLA mutations, which can reduce height but also have drawbacks such as lower nitrogen-use efficiency, these IDD genes may provide more targeted approaches to manage plant growth. By showing how IDD proteins promote stem and leaf expansion and by revealing their potential as alternative dwarfing alleles, our research opens new avenues both for fundamental research into plant growth pathways and for applications in cereal breeding. Ultimately, it could help produce crops with improved lodging resistance and fewer negative side effects than current dwarfing alleles."
"Understanding laser interactions with subcellular compartments is crucial for advancing optical microscopy, phototherapy, and optogenetics. While continuous-wave (CW) lasers rely on linear absorption, femtosecond (fs) lasers enable nonlinear multiphoton absorption confined to the laser focus, offering high axial precision. However, current fs laser delivery methods lack the ability to target dynamic molecular entities and automate target selection, limiting real-time perturbation of biomolecules with mobility or complex distribution. Additionally, existing technologies separate fs pulse delivery and imaging, preventing simultaneous recording of cellular responses. To overcome these challenges, we introduce fs real-time precision opto-control (fs-RPOC), which integrates a laser scanning microscope with a closed-loop feedback mechanism for automated, chemically selective subcellular perturbation. fs-RPOC achieves superior spatial precision and fast response time, enabling single- and sub-organelle microsurgery of dynamic targets and localized molecular modulation. By applying a pulse-picking method, fs-RPOC independently controls laser average and peak power at any desired subcellular compartment. Targeting mitochondria, fs-RPOC reveals site-specific molecular responses resulting from fs-laser-induced ROS formation, H2O2 diffusion, and low-density plasma generation. These findings offer new insights into fs laser interactions with subcellular compartments and demonstrate fs-RPOCs potential for precise molecular and organelle regulation."
"Hippocampal maps and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) value and goal representations support foraging in continuous spaces. How might hippocampal-vPFC interactions control the balance between behavioral exploration and exploitation? Using fMRI and reinforcement learning modeling, we investigated vPFC and hippocampal responses as humans explored and exploited a continuous one-dimensional space, with out-of-session and out-of-sample replication. The spatial distribution of rewards, or value landscape, modulated activity in the hippocampus and default network vPFC subregions, but not in ventrolateral prefrontal control subregions or medial orbitofrontal limbic subregions. While prefrontal default network and hippocampus displayed higher activity in less complex, easy-to-exploit value landscapes, vPFC-hippocampal connectivity increased in uncertain landscapes requiring exploration. Further, synchronization between prefrontal default network and posterior hippocampus scaled with behavioral exploration. Considered alongside electrophysiological studies, our findings suggest that locations to be explored are identified through coordinated activity binding prefrontal default network value representations to posterior hippocampal maps.

Significance StatementThe ventral prefrontal cortex represents goals and values, while the hippocampus contains maps of physical and abstract spaces. In recent years, neuroscientists have sought to understand how hippocampal-prefrontal interactions help us to solve complex problems such as deciding whether to exploit known rewards or explore in search of better alternatives. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and reinforcement learning modeling, we examine these interactions as humans explore and exploit an environment with a complex distribution of rewards or value landscape. We describe how this value landscape modulates activity and connectivity between prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, controlling the balance between exploration and exploitation."

"Ceramides are bioactive sphingolipids that are central to cellular metabolism, signaling, and stress responses. Synthesized de novo in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through a tightly regulated enzymatic pathway, ceramides can also be generated from hydrolysis complex sphingolipids, including hexosylceramides and sphingomyelins, and the salvage pathway. Their dynamic turnover across distinct cellular compartments results in spatial regulation of ceramide levels and its functional consequences. Mitochondrial ceramide accumulation, in particular, is a critical factor of apoptosis, where ceramides can disrupt membrane integrity. In addition to apoptosis, ceramides are implicated in replicative senescence. However, the mechanisms of ceramide regulation and function in senescence remain incompletely understood. In this study, we employed comparative lipid profiling, gene expression analysis and Raman spectroscopy to dissect sphingolipid regulatory networks that might be responsible for ceramide regulation and localization in senescence. We found that while both apoptotic and senescent cells exhibit elevated ceramide levels, only senescent cells display a marked depletion of sphingomyelins, especially very-long-chain species. Despite transcriptional upregulation of sphingomyelin synthase 1, enzymatic activity remained unchanged, suggesting impaired ceramide transport. Pharmacological inhibition of Ceramide Transfer Protein (CERT), the ER-to-Golgi ceramide transporter, phenocopied the senescent sphingolipid profile and enhanced senescence markers. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy revealed ceramide accumulation at the ER--but not the mitochondria--in senescent cells, consistent with a non-apoptotic phenotype. Together, our results identify disrupted ceramide turnover to sphingomyelin as a key feature of senescence and highlight the importance of subcellular ceramide localization in determining cell fate."
"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWBiomarker discovery for complex diseases like cancer hinges on uncovering molecular signatures that capture intricate, interconnected relationships within biological data, a challenge that traditional statistical and machine learning methods often fail to meet due to the complexity of high-dimensional gene expression profiles. To overcome this, we introduce the Expression Graph Network Framework (EGNF), a cutting-edge graph-based approach that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with network-based feature engineering to enhance predictive biomarker identification. EGNF constructs biologically informed networks by combining gene expression data and clinical attributes within a graph database, utilizing hierarchical clustering to generate dynamic, patient-specific representations of molecular interactions. Leveraging graph learning techniques, including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), our framework identifies statistically significant and biologically relevant gene modules for classification. Validated across three independent datasets consisting of contrasting tumor types and clinical scenarios, EGNF consistently outperforms traditional machine learning models, achieving superior classification accuracy and interpretability. Notably, it delivers perfect separation between normal and tumor samples while excelling in nuanced tasks such as classifying disease progression and treatment outcome. This scalable, interpretable, and robust framework provides a powerful tool for biomarker discovery, with wide-ranging applications in precision medicine and the elucidation of disease mechanisms across diverse clinical contexts."
"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is essential for top-down control of affect and its dysfunction is implicated in many psychiatric disorders. Inhibitory interneurons expressing somatostatin have been implicated in cognition, affect, and disease. However, somatostatins function as a neuropeptide transmitter remains unclear. Here, we investigated the contribution of somatostatin neurotransmission in differentiating between salient (rewarding or aversive) and neutral outcomes. Monitoring somatostatin release and somatostatin receptor antagonism revealed time-dependent regulation of outcome-specific associative learning during acquisition. We found that somatostatin transmission enables configural representations incorporating a salient, aversive outcome in prefrontal cortical neurons, and a threat-driven shift in population-level network activity in-vivo. These findings show a novel role for somatostatin, an interneuron ""cellular marker"", signaling in shaping learning and emergent network dynamics. Further this framework revealed that reduced somatostatin neuropeptidergic transmission may impair top-down control of affective behaviors observed in mental health disorders, suggesting potential new avenues for therapeutic intervention."
"Genome plasticity can be defined as the capacity of a bacterial population to swiftly gain or lose genes. The time factor plays a fundamental role for the evolutionary success of microbes, particularly when considering pathogens and their tendency to gain antimicrobial resistance factors under the pressure of the extensive use of antibiotics. Multiple metrics have been proposed to provide insights into the gene content repertoire, yet they overlook the temporal component, which has a critical role in determining the adaptation and survival of a bacterial strain. In this study, we introduce a novel index that incorporates the time dimension to assess the rate at which bacteria exchange genes, thus fitting the definition of plasticity. Opposite to available indexes, our method also takes into account the possibility of contiguous genes being transferred together in one single event. We applied our novel index to measure plasticity in three widely studied bacterial species: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Our results highlight distinctive plasticity patterns in specific sequence types and clusters, suggesting a possible correlation between heightened genome plasticity and globally recognized high-risk clones. Our approach holds promise as an index for predicting the emergence of strains of potential clinical concern, possibly allowing for timely and more effective interventions.

Impact statementHow quickly bacterial populations can acquire new functions is the key to their evolutionary success. This speed, called genome plasticity, is particularly relevant for human pathogens, especially when considering the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance. Today, the availability of large numbers of genomes from public databases makes it possible to develop a way to measure plasticity. However, none is currently available, besides indexes of gene content variability, which do not take into account the rate at which such gene content changes. In this work, we developed a plasticity index, called Flux Of Gene Segments (FOGS), and we tested it on large datasets of bacterial pathogen genomes. Interestingly, the subpopulations of the selected species that showed higher FOGS correspond to globally emerging high-risk clones. Therefore, we suggest that our index might be used not only to detect but also to predict emerging strains of human health concern.

"Tauopathies are characterized by the progressive accumulation of abnormal tau species, which disrupt the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP), a critical system for degrading intracellular macromolecules and aggregated proteins, causing toxicity and cell death. This study investigates the impact of the N-terminally truncated Tau35 protein overexpression on proteolytic pathways, including effects on autophagy and endo-lysosomal processes. Using a Tau35 mouse model and SH-SY5Y cell lines stably expressing either the Tau35 fragment or full-length tau, we employed western blotting, proteomic analysis of lysosome-enriched brain fractions, proteolysis/endocytosis assays, and live-cell imaging with the lysotracker reporter to assess protein degradation and lysosomal function. Our findings identify early pathological changes in endo-lysosomal processes, including increased endocytosis, proteolytic dysfunction and lysosomal motility abnormalities, associated with Tau35-induced toxicity. This work extends previous research by providing new insights into the mechanisms of Tau35-induced neurotoxicity, offering a foundation for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to address tauopathies."
"Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (IST) enables high-resolution spatial mapping of RNA species. A key challenge in IST is accurate cell segmentation to assign each RNA molecule to the right cell. Here, we present RNA2seg, a novel segmentation algorithm trained on over 4 million cells from MERFISH and CosMx datasets across seven organs using a teacher-student training scheme. RNA2seg integrates RNA point clouds and all available membrane and nuclear stainings. Validation on manually annotated data shows superior performance including in zero-shot and few-shot settings. The method is available as a documented pip package: https://github.com/fish-quant/rna2seg."
"Predicting forest responses to climate change requires a detailed understanding of trait-environment coordination. Adaptation to environment comprises both conserved and labile components of trait variation. However, few studies explore the decomposition of trait-environment relationships in a rigorous phylogenetic framework. Combining a revised phylogeny with trait, climate and soil data to achieve unprecedented species coverage ([~]85%), we identified patterns of replicated evolution that allowed the evergreen tree genus, Eucalyptus, to rapidly radiate across Australia in response to aridification. Eucalypts from arid regions are short, produce dense wood, and have small, physically robust leaves with high nitrogen content, promoting hydraulic safety and economies in photosynthetic water use. Phylogenetic modelling reveals strong niche conservatism, with adaptation to aridity occurring primarily via clade-level divergences, followed by phylogenetically independent adjustments to local conditions. Ancestral state reconstructions accounting for trends in the paleoclimate record indicate that transitions in aridity tolerance are associated with distinct signals of environmental filtering and directional selection on functional trait variation. However, astonishing repeatability of trait changes in different clades reveals a narrow optimal solution to water availability, opening a path to predict future species distributions from phylogenetically structured trait data and signalling major implications for functional and species diversity under progressive climate change."
"Transcriptional regulation--the modulation of gene expression in response to environmental stimuli--is fundamental to cellular function. Identifying groups of co-regulated genes helps elucidate gene functions and characterize how an organism has evolved to respond to various stimuli. In previous works, signal processing algorithms have been applied to characterize the transcriptional regulatory modes, known as iModulons, of bacteria. However, these methods do not quantify uncertainty of the results and are difficult to integrate with different sources of information. In this work, we propose a Bayesian model of Independent Component Analysis that addresses these issues by providing a formal structure to quantify the uncertainty of gene activations and membership of co-regulated genes, achieving state-of-the-art alignment with known regulators. Furthermore, we expand this Bayesian model to explain and integrate first multi-strain and then multi-omics data.

Author summaryUnderstanding how genes are turned on and off is crucial for deciphering how living organisms respond to their environment. Genes often work together in groups, and identifying these co-regulated groups can reveal their functions and how organisms adapt to changes. Previous methods have used complex mathematical techniques to find these gene groups in bacteria, but they come with limitations: they do not measure how confident we can be in the results and are hard to combine with other types of biological information.

In our study, we introduce a new approach using Bayesian statistics to overcome these challenges. This method not only helps us identify groups of co-regulated genes more accurately but also allows us to quantify our confidence in these findings. Additionally, our approach can easily integrate different kinds of data, such as information from various bacterial strains or other biological processes. This makes our method a powerful tool for exploring gene regulation, with potential applications in understanding diseases, developing new treatments and advancing biotechnology."
"Bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant public health threat. The advent of global awareness and affordable whole genome sequencing has yielded an ever-growing collection of bacterial genome sequence datasets and corresponding antibiotic resistance metadata. This enables the use of computational techniques, including machine learning (ML), to predict phenotypes and discover novel AMR-associated variants. With the great variety of resistance mechanisms to interrogate and the number of datasets that can be mined, there is a need to identify where novel AMR marker discovery is most necessary. Multiple databases and annotation pipelines exist to identify AMR variants known to be associated with resistance to specific antibiotics or antibiotic classes, however, the completeness of these databases varies and for some antibiotics even the most complete databases remain insufficient for accurate classification. Here, we couple these pipelines with predictive ML models, which we call ""minimal models"" of resistance. We predict the binary resistance phenotypes of 20 major antimicrobials in the genomically diverse pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae. We present a detailed comparison of the annotation pipelines and drug resistance databases currently available, and we identify their shortcomings in phenotype prediction, highlighting opportunities for novel marker discovery. We further provide a description of a Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) database, highlighting the observed AMR mechanism as the key for phenotype prediction in this dataset. This analysis has relevance for all those seeking to use or improve drug resistance databases. It provides a critical review of the differences in annotation tools and databases commonly used in bacterial AMR studies, identifying existing gaps and novel AMR marker discovery niches. It outlines guidance for the establishment of a real standard dataset for the development and benchmarking of ML models of AMR."
"Temperate forest ecosystems are important habitats for many bat species. However, these habitats are increasingly affected by anthropogenic disturbances, particularly urban development, leading to landscapes with varying land cover composition and configuration. Limited research has examined how forest and urban landscape composition and configuration influence bat activity and diversity. Using a multi-year statewide bat acoustic monitoring dataset from North Carolina, United States, we investigated the effects of forest and urban composition and configuration at multiple spatial scales on bat activity and diversity. First, we constructed single-variable landscape index regression models and found that both composition and configuration of forests and urban developments influenced bat activity and diversity in a species-specific manner. Next, we applied a hierarchical partitioning approach to compare the relative contributions of composition and configuration indices in explaining variance in bat activity. For big brown bats and hoary bats, evergreen forest and urban development composition indices contributed the most to explaining activity variance. In contrast, for eastern red bats, evening bats, and tricolored bats, deciduous forest fragmentation indices describing landscape configuration were the most influential factors. Silver-haired bat activity variance was primarily explained by an evergreen forest fragmentation index. Lastly, urban development configuration indices were the strongest predictors of Mexican free-tailed bat activity and total bat activity. These results suggest that forest and urban landscape configuration should be considered in conservation and management planning for North American temperate forest ecosystems, particularly in regions that have not experienced drastic deforestation in recent decades."
"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an essential biotechnology for sustainable waste management and bioenergy production, driven by a complex microbial ecosystem. However, the stability and efficiency of AD reactors are frequently challenged by microbial shifts resulting from operational disturbances. This study employs microbiome-oriented data mining and bioinformatics approaches to analyze microbial community dynamics in an anaerobic digestion reactor under steady-state operation, failure, and restoration phases. Data were extracted from a biogas plant and used to evaluate a system failure, providing crucial insights into microbial shifts associated with operational instability. A custom-built microbiome-oriented database, 2Gas, was developed to integrate sequencing data with physicochemical monitoring results, enabling structured data storage, retrieval, and correlation analysis. This database was instrumental in identifying key microbial taxa responsible for reactor destabilization and in predicting failure events based on microbial and physicochemical trends. Through high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and advanced bioinformatics analysis, microbial shifts were correlated with key operational parameters such as pH, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and ammonia concentrations. Results indicate that methanogenic archaea, particularly Methanosarcina, experienced a sharp decline during reactor failure, followed by a gradual recovery, demonstrating their sensitivity to environmental stressors. Additionally, the balance between Firmicutes and Actinobacteria was identified as a crucial determinant of reactor stability, with Firmicutes recovering in tandem with system restoration. Feedstock composition was found to play a significant role in microbial shifts, with seasonal variability influencing community composition and reactor performance. Machine learning models applied to the database suggested the potential for predictive analytics in anticipating system failures. By leveraging microbial abundance patterns, these models were able to identify early warning signs of instability. Restoration efforts, including feedstock adjustments and operational parameter optimization, successfully reinstated core microbial communities essential for biogas production. This study underscores the critical role of microbiome monitoring in anaerobic digestion and highlights the potential of bioinformatics tools for enhancing reactor resilience. Future research should focus on real-time microbiome tracking, machine learning-driven predictive maintenance, and adaptive operational strategies to further improve AD efficiency and biogas yield."
"We report the cryoEM structure of the Francisella protein FTN_1118, identifying it as a novel 13 kDa periplasmic protein unique to the Francisella genus, which we now designate FPM13 (Francisella Periplasmic Metalloprotein, 13 kDa) based on its structural and biochemical properties. FPM13 was serendipitously identified during purification of Francisella type VI secretion system (T6SS) effector proteins, co-purifying with them. Its identity, initially unknown, was established using the novel cryoID method. The structure reveals a symmetrical, donut-shaped 18-mer with 9-fold dihedral symmetry, formed by two stacked nonamers head-to-head. It measures [~]8 nm both in height and in outer diameter, and has a 3.5 nm central channel. The complex features a double-layered wall with an inner {beta}-sheet core and an outer -helical shell. Each monomer adopts a compact fold comprising an N-terminus {beta}-strand, an -helix and two additional {beta} strands at the C-terminus. The assembly is stabilized by inter-ring loop interactions and hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts between neighboring subunits. Biochemical analyses, as shown by APEX-biotinylation and Triton X-114 phase partitioning, confirmed that FPM13 is a soluble periplasmic protein. ICP-MS demonstrated that FPM13 binds iron and copper. Deletion of FPM13 in Francisella novicida strains caused no growth defects in macrophages or mice but show increased copper sensitivity under iron-depleted conditions, suggesting a role for FPM13 in metal transport or detoxification."
"Plants are hosts for above- and belowground insect communities that can influence each other via above-belowground plant-physiological dynamics. To mediate interactions, plants produce secondary metabolites, including terpenoids, and mixtures can differ intraspecifically. While intraspecific variation in plant chemistry gained increased interest, the extent to which intraspecific differences in plant chemistry mediate above-belowground interactions of herbivores remains unclear. We used a full factorial design with six distinct terpenoid chemotypes, differing in their chemical diversity of tansy (Tanacetum vulgare). We exposed these to the aboveground herbivore Macrosiphoniella tanacetaria (Hemiptera: Aphididae), the belowground herbivore Agriotes sp. (Coleoptera: Elateridae), no herbivore or both herbivores, to determine if chemotypes or the chemical diversity of plant compounds affected aphid performance and if the chemical profile mediated the interactions between herbivores. We found that aphid colony size differed between chemotypes, with the strongest colony increase over time in a mixed-mixtures chemotype, and the weakest in a {beta}-thujone chemotype. Root herbivory had no effect on aphid colony size and this did not differ between chemotypes. Aphid colony size was positively correlated with terpenoid evenness, but not with other diversity components. Tansy chemotypes differed in their morphological responses to aboveground herbivory, whereas belowground herbivory exerted minimal impacts. Overall, our results show that intraspecific variation in terpenoid profiles directly and indirectly modify ecological interactions on a plant, with plant chemistry mediating aphid performance and chemotypes differing in their morphological responses to herbivory."
"The ability of species to form diverse communities is not fully understood. Species are known to interact in various ways with their neighborhood. Despite this, common models of species coexistence assume that per capita interactions are constant and competitive, even as the environment changes. In this study, we investigate how neighbor density-dependent variation in the strength and sign of species interactions changes species and community dynamics. We show that by including these sources of variation, predictions of ecological dynamics are significantly improved compared to outcomes of typical models that hold interaction strengths constant. We compared how well models based on different functions of neighbor density and identity did in describing population trajectories (i.e., persistence over time) and community dynamics (i.e., temporal stability, synchrony and degree of oscillation) in simulated two-species communities and a real diverse annual plant system. In our simulated communities, we found the highest level of coexistence between species pairs when species interactions varied from competitive to facilitative according to neighbor density (i.e., following a sigmoid function). Introducing within-guild facilitation through a nonlinear bounded function allowed populations, both simulated and empirical, to avoid extinction or runaway growth. In fact, nonlinear bounded functions (i.e., exponential and sigmoid functions) predicted population trends over time within the range of abundances observed over the last 10 years. With the sigmoid function, the simulated communities of two species displayed a higher probability of synchrony and oscillation than other functional forms. These simulated communities did not always show temporal stability but were predicted to coexist. Overall, varying species interactions lead to realistic ecological trajectories and community dynamics when bounded by asymptotes based on neighbor density. These findings are important for advancing our understanding of how diverse communities are sustained and for operationalizing ecological theory in the study of the real world."
"Prior studies have suggested that non-aureus staphylococci and mammaliicoci (NASM) possess inhibitory activity against mastitis pathogens. However, their impact on udder health outcomes and the mechanisms underlying this potential protective effect remain poorly understood. Our first objective was to identify NASM species on teat apices of organic dairy cows, assess their within-species phylogeny, and explore associations with presence of intramammary infections (IMI) and genomic features, including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), virulence, and resistance genes. The second objective was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of NASM isolates against mastitis pathogens and examine its associations with taxonomy, phylogeny, AMP genes, and IMI. Milk and teat apex swabs were collected weekly from 114 cows on two organic farms. Milk was cultured to identify Staphylococcus aureus (SAU) or Streptococcus spp. and Streptococcus-like organisms (SSLO) IMI. A case-control was designed to include cows with and without SAU or SSLO IMI. For each selected cow, the teat apex gauze swab collected during the week preceding IMI diagnosis (or corresponding time for controls) was aerobically cultured, and the taxonomy of isolates was determined using mass spectrometry. Isolates classified as NASM were subjected to whole genome sequencing using Illumina MiSeq. The inhibitory activity of NASM isolates was tested against SAU and Streptococcus uberis. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using Snippy and IQ-TREE. Genomes were assembled and annotated to identify species, AMP genes, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance markers. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of NASM varied across species and between cows with and without an IMI. Staphylococcus succinus was the species most frequently associated with highly inhibitory isolates, which were more prevalent in cows without IMI (19.4% vs 5.8%). Organic dairy cow teat apices harbored multiple NASM species and strains. All isolates had at least 1 AMP associated gene in their genome. In vitro antimicrobial activity was generally unrelated to clade membership, except for isolates classified as Staphylococcus succinus. Staphylococcus aureus had high virulence gene prevalence, while NASM species showed lower, species-specific prevalence. This study advances understanding of NASM antimicrobial activity and virulence potential."
"The population of Asian elephants, an endangered species, is decreasing significantly due to anthropogenic interference in India. Research on Asian elephant disease is largely confined to observations reported from captive populations. The present study explored 11 disease investigation cases whose clinicopathological changes were similar to those of fatal hemorrhagic disease caused by Bacillus anthracis. We used molecular diagnostic approaches such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction), quantitative PCR, 16S metagenomics analysis and whole-metagenome sequencing for identification of the etiological agent responsible for these wild elephant mortalities. 16S metagenomics analysis revealed the presence of Clostridium hemolyticum as the dominant bacteria in all the mortality events. In contrast, flagellin gene-specific identification of all the samples and whole metagenomics analysis of blood samples collected from the ear pinna of a freshly deceased elephant revealed Clostridium novyi type B as the sole pathogenic agent responsible for the death of elephants. This study provides the first evidence of the involvement of Clostridium novyi type B in the death of wild elephants with similar clinical manifestations to anthrax. The current study also provides ample evidence of the need to explore investigations of emerging diseases of wild elephants to conserve these large mammals."
"The plasma membrane potential has been linked to cell proliferation for more than 40 years. Here we experimentally showed that membrane depolarization upregulates cell mitosis, and that this process is dependent on voltage-dependent activation of ERK. ERK activity exhibits a membrane potential-dependency that is independent from the growth factor. This membrane potential dependence was observed even close to the resting membrane potential, indicating that small changes in resting membrane potential can alter cell proliferative activity. The voltage-dependent ERK activity is derived from changed dynamics of phosphatidylserine which is present in the plasma membrane and not by extracellular calcium entry. The data suggests that crucial biological processes such as cell proliferation are regulated by the physicochemical properties of the lipid. This study suggests that membrane potential may have diverse physiological functions beyond the action potential, which is well-established in the neural system."
"Homologous recombination maintains genome stability by repairing double strand breaks and protecting replication fork stability. Defects in homologous recombination results in cancer predisposition but can be exploited due to increased sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutics such as PARP inhibitors. The NEK8 kinase has roles in the replication response and homologous recombination. NEK8 is overexpressed in breast cancer, but the impact of NEK8 overexpression on homologous recombination has not been determined. Here, we demonstrate NEK8 overexpression inhibits RAD51 focus formation resulting in a defect in homologous recombination and degradation of stalled replication forks. Importantly, NEK8 overexpression sensitizes cells to the PARP inhibitor, Olaparib. Together, our results suggest NEK8 overexpressing tumors may be recombination-deficient and respond to chemotherapeutics that target defects in recombination such as Olaparib."
"Most of the existing methods including our NTxPred, use a single model to predict both neurotoxic peptides and neurotoxic proteins (neurotoxins). In this study, we developed distinct models for predicting neurotoxic peptides and neurotoxins. Our peptide dataset consists of 877 neurotoxic and 877 non-neurotoxic peptides, while our protein dataset includes 775 neurotoxins and 775 non-neurotoxins. Preliminary analysis reveals that certain residues, such as cysteine, are more prevalent in both neurotoxic peptides and proteins, though their abundance differs in magnitude. First, we developed machine learning models using composition and binary profiles, achieving a maximum AUC of 0.97 for peptides and 0.85 for proteins. The performance for proteins improved from an AUC of 0.85 to 0.89 when evolutionary information was incorporated. Next, we built machine learning models using embeddings from protein language models, attaining an AUC of 0.96 for peptides and 0.94 for proteins. We also developed protein language models and achieved an AUC of 0.98 for peptides using esm2-t30 and 0.91 for proteins using esm2-t6. All models were trained and tested using 5-fold cross-validation, and final models were evaluated on an independent dataset not used in training. We further assessed protein models on the peptide dataset and vice versa, highlighting the necessity of separate models. The proposed models outperform existing methods on independent datasets. Our neurotoxicity prediction models will aid in the safety assessment of genetically modified foods and therapeutic proteins by minimizing the need for animal testing.

"Orexin (hypocretin) neuropeptides regulate numerous essential functions including sleep/wake state stability and reward processing. Orexin synthesizing neurons respond to drug cues and undergo structural changes following persistent drug exposure. Post-mortem brains from opioid users, and opioid-treated rodents have orexin somata that become [~]20 % smaller and [~]50% more numerous and are postulated to promote hyper-motivation for drug-seeking though increased orexin release. Biophysical considerations suggest that decreased soma size should increase cellular excitability, however the impact of chronic opioids on firing ability, which drives peptide release, has not been explored. To test this, we assessed the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of orexin neurons by whole-cell recordings in slices from male orexin-EGFP mice treated by daily morphine or saline injections for two weeks. Paradoxically, we found that while daily morphine decreased average soma size, it impaired excitability in a subpopulation of orexin neurons identified by electrophysiological criteria as ""H-type"", while entirely sparing ""D-type"" neurons. This impairment was manifest by smaller, broader action potentials, variable firing and a downscaling of firing gain. These adaptations required more than a single morphine dose and recovered, along with soma size, after four weeks of passive withdrawal. Taken together, these observations indicate that daily opioid exposure differentially impacts H-type orexin neurons and predicts that the ability of these neurons to encode synaptic inputs into spike trains and to release neuropeptides becomes impaired in conjunction with opioid dependence.

Significance StatementOrexin peptide signaling sustains motivation for opioid and cocaine seeking and chronic use upregulates orexin peptides and induces structural changes consistent with enhanced orexin release. However, the impact of chronic drug exposure on the ability of orexin neurons to fire action potentials which drive peptide release has not been explored. Paradoxically, we found that two weeks of daily morphine exposure selectively and reversibly impaired action potential firing in a distinct subpopulation of orexin neurons (H-cells). These findings further support a functional dichotomy among orexin neurons and imply that the ability of H-cells to encode input signals and release neuropeptides becomes impaired during development of opioid dependence."
"Solenopsis invicta, commonly known as the fire ant, is characterized by aggressive behavior and exceptional invasive capabilities, rendering conventional control methods largely ineffective. Here, we explore the implementation of homing suppression gene drive in fire ants by developing a spatially explicit model that incorporates both monogyne and polygyne colony structures, enabling comprehensive evaluation of genetic control strategies. Ants may present unique challenges for gene drive due to their colony structure and haplodiploidy. Our results reveal that after an extended period of time, gene drive effectively eliminates polygyne colonies, but monogyne populations often persist at low level. Though standard suppression drives in haplodiploids have reduced power, new dominant-sterile resistance or two-target strategies, as well as drives that affect the colony structure, can restore high suppressive capability. Interspecific competition can also exert a positive effect on gene drive-mediated population suppression dynamics. In particular, a gene drive release during the invasion phase significantly enhances population suppression, enabling native ants to successfully recolonize their original habitats. We also identify several conserved female fertility genes in fire ants, together with gRNA targets that may support efficient, low-resistance suppression drive designs. Overall, we conclude that while gene drive in fire ants may take place over extended time scales, its long-term results, even with imperfect efficiency, are quite promising."
"BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD), a condition defined by deficits in social communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors, is associated with early impairments in motor imitation that persist through childhood and into adulthood. Alterations in the mirror neuron system (MNS), crucial for interpreting and imitating actions, may underlie these ASD-associated differences in motor imitation. High-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) overcomes logistical challenges of functional magnetic resonance imaging to enable identification of neural substrates of naturalistic motor imitation.

ObjectiveWe aim to investigate brain function underlying motor observation and imitation in autistic and non-autistic adults. We hypothesize that HD-DOT will reveal greater activation in regions associated with the MNS during motor imitation than motor observation, and that MNS activity will negatively correlate with autistic traits and motor fidelity.

MethodsWe imaged brain function using HD-DOT in N = 100 participants as they engaged in observing or imitating a sequence of arm movements. Additionally, during imitation, participant movements were simultaneously recorded with 3D cameras for computer-vision-based assessment of motor imitation (CAMI). Cortical responses were estimated using general linear models, and multiple regression was used to test for associations with autistic traits, assessed via the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS), and imitation fidelity, assessed via CAMI.

ResultsBoth observing and imitating motor movements elicited significant activations in higher-order visual and MNS regions, including the inferior parietal lobule, superior temporal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus. Imitation additionally exhibited greater activation in the superior parietal lobule, primary motor cortex, and supplementary motor area. Notably, the right temporal-parietal junction exhibited activation during observation but not during imitation. Higher autistic traits were associated with increased activation during motor observation in the right superior parietal lobule. No significant correlation between brain activation and CAMI scores was observed.

ConclusionsOur findings provide robust evidence of shared and task-specific cortical responses underlying motor observation and imitation, emphasizing the differential engagement of MNS regions during motor observation and imitation."
"DNA methylation in social insects has been proposed as a key mechanism underlying both reproductive and non-reproductive caste determination by regulating gene expression in response to environmental cues. So far, studies on DNA methylation in social insects have yielded mixed results, with some studies finding no effect on caste determination or worker behaviour while others have reported such effects. In order to link DNA methylation to either process one first needs to show variation in DNA methylation between castes and developmental stages. This study determined cytosin methylation in a CpG context (CmpG) in the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus using ONT (Oxford Nanopore Sequencing) sequencing in larvae, pupae, workers and queens, moreover we compared accuracy of methylation with the gold standard WGBS (Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing). Methylation sites were highly correlated between WGBS and ONT (r2=0.8). Overall, the P. californicus genome showed low levels of methylation (3%) which is comparable to what has been found in other Hymenopterans. DNA methylation was significantly increased in gene bodies and in particular exons and showed a significant decrease at the transcription start site and promotor region. Introns, intergenic regions and transposable elements have the lowest levels of DNA methylation. Gene body methylation was positively correlated with gene expression in queens, which is in accordance with other studies and the opposite of what is found in vertebrate studies. Both castes and developmental stages showed significant variation and differences in gene body methylation frequencies. Furthermore, castes and stages which have a high metabolic rate (queens and pupae) show higher DNA methylation, suggesting plasticity and an active role of DNA methylation in gene regulation and in extension caste regulation."
"KRAB-zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) comprise the largest family of mammalian transcription factors, rapidly evolving within and between species. Most KZFPs repress endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and other retrotransposons, with KZFP gene numbers correlating with the ERV load across species, suggesting coevolution. How new KZFPs emerge in response to ERV invasions is currently unknown. Using a combination of long-read sequencing technologies and genome assembly, we present a first detailed comparative analysis of young KZFP gene clusters in the mouse lineage, which has undergone recent KZFP gene expansion and ERV infiltration. Detailed annotation of KZFP genes in a cluster on Mus musculus Chromosome 4 revealed parallel expansion and diversification of this locus in different mouse strains (C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ and CAST/EiJ) and species (Mus spretus and Mus pahari). Our data supports a model by which new ERV integrations within young KZFP gene clusters likely promoted recombination events leading to the emergence of new KZFPs that repress them. At the same time, ERVs also increased their numbers by duplication instead of retrotransposition alone, unraveling a new mechanism for ERV enrichment at these loci."
"Cancer is a leading global cause of mortality, responsible for nearly 10 million deaths annually, with breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers among the most prevalent. Despite extensive research on individual cancer types, identifying shared molecular signatures could unlock pan-cancer diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets. This study leveraged RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to analyze our selected cancer types (SCTs)--breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate, employing a multi-step bioinformatics pipeline. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between tumors and normal tissues were identified and validated using an Elastic Net regression model. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) revealed highly correlated gene modules linked to clinical traits, pinpointing 179 shared signature genes across the SCTs. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and clustering analyses further refined these to 26 hub genes, enriched in cancer hallmark pathways. Nine hub genes--KIF18B, RRM2, MYBL2, IQGAP3, TPX2, SLC7A11, RHPN1, HJURP, and SKA3--stood out due to consistent upregulation in metastatic tumors (breast, colorectal, prostate) and their high expression across more than 18 different cancer types, suggesting roles as oncogenes, prognostic markers, or therapeutic targets. The expression patterns of hub genes were further validated across larger cancer patient cohorts of SCTs, confirming relevance across multiple datasets, and their prognostic significance was assessed by their influence on overall survival (OS). Notably, these hub genes also correlated with immune-related functions, potentially influencing tumor microenvironment modulation. This integrative approach provides a strong framework for identifying cross-cancer potential biomarkers, advancing pan-cancer insights, and supporting improved diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy development."
"How RIF1 (RAP1 interacting factor) fulfills its diverse roles in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, DNA replication, and nuclear organization remains elusive. Here we show that alternative splicing (AS) of a cassette exon (Ex32) encoding a Ser/Lys-rich (S/K) cassette in the RIF1 C-terminal domain (CTD) gives rise to RIF1-Long (RIF1-L) and RIF1-Short (RIF1-S) isoforms with different functional characteristics. We demonstrate that RIF1-Ex32 splice-in is mediated by an exonic splicing enhancer that is recognized by the splicing factor SRSF1 and antagonized by splicing inhibitors SRSF3 and SRSF7. Exposure to DNA damage inhibited Ex32 splice-in, potentiated the association of SRSF3 and SRSF7 with RIF1 pre-mRNA, and caused an increase in RIF1-S protein expression, which was also observed across a diverse set of primary cancers. Isoform-specific proteomic analyses revealed RIF1-L preferentially associated with mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and sustained MDC1 focus formation to a greater extent than RIF1-S. We further show that the S/K cassette stabilized a novel phase separation activity of the RIF1 CTD and enhanced RIF1-L chromatin retention, which was reversed by CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of the RIF1 CTD in response to G2 DNA damage checkpoint inhibition. These combined findings suggest DNA damage-dependent RIF1 AS contributes to RIF1 functional diversification in genome protection."
"Proteases, a class of enzymes that play critical roles in health and disease, exert their function through the cleavage of peptide bonds. Identifying substrates that are efficiently and selectively cleaved by target proteases is essential for studying protease activity and for harnessing their activity in protease-activated diagnostics and therapeutics. However, the vast design space of possible substrates (c.a. 2010 unique amino acid combinations for a 10-mer peptide) and the limited accessibility of high-throughput activity profiling tools hinder the speed and success of substrate design. We present CleaveNet, an end-to-end AI pipeline for the design of protease substrates. Applied to matrix metalloproteinases, CleaveNet enhances the scale, tunability, and efficiency of substrate design. CleaveNet generates peptide substrates that exhibit sound biophysical properties and capture not only well-established but also novel cleavage motifs. To enable precise control over substrate design, CleaveNet incorporates a conditioning tag that enables generation of peptides guided by a target cleavage profile, enabling targeted design of efficient and selective substrates. CleaveNet-generated substrates were validated experimentally through a large-scale in vitro screen, even in the challenging case of designing highly selective substrates for MMP13. We envision that CleaveNet will accelerate our ability to study and capitalize on protease activity, paving the way for new in silico design tools across enzyme classes."
"Living organisms integrate multiple signals from their exposome--the totality of environmental influences experienced throughout life--to adapt to complex, non-stationary environments. While organisms are thought to flexibly prioritize relevant signals depending on context, its regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. Laboratory studies with precisely controlled conditions fail to capture this adaptability by isolating organisms from the complex exposome. Here, we developed a machine learning framework, Inverse Signal Importance (ISI), to infer how organisms prioritize external cues from time-series data of environmental factors and physiological responses. We applied ISI to analyze gonadal development in medaka fish under natural outdoor conditions, tracking gonadosomatic index alongside environmental signals including water temperature, day length, and solar radiation over two years. Our analysis revealed that signal importance levels exhibit complex dynamics distinct from simple environmental periodicity and correlates significantly with specific gene expression patterns. Notably, genes associated with temperature-related signal importance display differential expression between outdoor and controlled laboratory conditions, suggesting their role in environmental adaptation. These findings indicate that ISI effectively captures latent physiological dynamics in adaptation of exposome. By decomposing biological responses into deterministic and adaptive components, ISI provides a novel approach to uncover mechanisms of organismal adaptation in natural environments."
"Cobamides, the vitamin B12 (cobalamin) family of cofactors, are used by most organisms but produced by only a fraction of prokaryotes, and are thus considered key shared nutrients among microbes. Cobamides are structurally diverse, with multiple different cobamides found in most microbial communities. The ability to use different cobamides has been tested for several bacteria and microalgae, and nearly all show preferences for certain cobamides. This approach is limited by the commercial unavailability of cobamides other than cobalamin. Here, we have extracted and purified seven commercially unavailable cobamides to characterize bacterial cobamide preferences based on growth in specific cobamide-dependent conditions. The tested bacteria include engineered strains of Escherichia coli, Sinorhizobium meliloti, and Bacillus subtilis expressing native or heterologous cobamide-dependent enzymes, cultured under conditions that functionally isolate specific cobamide-dependent processes such as methionine synthesis. Comparison of these results to previous studies of diverse bacteria and microalgae revealed that a broad diversity of cobamide preferences exists not only across different organisms, but also between different cobamide-dependent metabolic pathways within the same organism. The microbes differed in the cobamides that support growth most efficiently, cobamides that do not support growth, and the minimum cobamide concentrations required for growth. The latter differ by up to four orders of magnitude across organisms from different environments and by up to 20-fold between cobamide-dependent enzymes within the same organism. Given that cobamides are shared, required for use of specific growth substrates, and essential for central metabolism in certain organisms, cobamide preferences likely impact community structure and function."
"In a lipid bilayer, the interactions between lipid hydrocarbon chains from opposing leaflets can influence membrane properties. These interactions include the phenomenon of interdigitation, in which an acyl chain of one leaflet extends past the bilayer midplane and into the opposing leaflet. While static interdigitation is well understood in gel phase bilayers from X-ray diffraction measurements, much less is known about dynamic interdigitation in fluid phases. In this regard, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations can provide mechanistic information on interleaflet interactions that can be used to generate experimentally testable hypotheses. To address limitations of existing computational methodologies which provide results that are either indirect or averaged over time and space, here we introduce three novel ways of quantifying the extent of chain interdigitation. Our protocols include the analysis of instantaneous interactions at the level of individual carbon atoms, thus providing temporal and spatial resolution for a more nuanced picture of dynamic interdigitation. We compare the methods on bilayers composed of lipids with equal total number of carbon atoms but different mismatches between the sn-1 and sn-2 chain lengths. We find that these metrics, which are based on freely available software packages and are easy to implement, provide complementary details that help characterize various features of lipid-lipid contacts at the bilayer midplane. The new frameworks thus allow for a deeper look at fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying bilayer structure and dynamics, and present a valuable expansion of the membrane biophysics toolkit."
"Marine environments harbor a vast diversity of microorganisms, which have developed multiple strategies to adapt to challenging conditions and represent a valuable source for new products such as pigments, enzymes and bioactive compounds. From all microorganisms inhabiting marine environments, fungi have been the least studied, despite their ubiquitous presence and great biotechnological potential. Here, we focused on the isolation and characterization of filamentous fungi from marine sediment samples, which were collected along the Basque coast in Spain. Through phenotypic characterization, we identified isolates potentially able to produce secondary metabolites or grow on minimal culture medium supplemented with recalcitrant algal polysaccharides. Based on this screening, two Sordariomycetes isolates were selected for further analyses through genome sequencing and omics techniques: 1) a Marquandomyces marquandii strain able to stain the culture medium in yellow, indicative of secretion of pigments and secondary metabolites and 2) an Albophoma yamanashiensis strain able to grow in minimal culture medium supplemented with the recalcitrant algal polysaccharide fucoidan. Fungal co-culture experiments suggested an inhibitory effect of the secretome of M. marquandii on fungal growth. Under culture conditions inducing pigment secretion, a set of secondary metabolite gene clusters were differentially expressed, as analysed by RNA-seq. On the other hand, transcriptomic and proteomic experiments on A. yamanashiensis unveiled the enzymatic activities expressed in response to the presence of fucoidan. Overall, our results indicate that the isolated marine fungal strains could serve as a source of new enzymatic activities and secondary metabolites."
"Cellular senescence is an irreversible form of cell-cycle arrest caused by excessive stress or damage. While various biomarkers of cellular senescence have been proposed, there are currently no universal, stand-alone indicators of this condition. The field largely relies on the combined detection of multiple biomarkers to differentiate senescent cells from non-senescent cells. Here we introduce a new approach: unbiased cell culture selections to identify senescent cell-specific folded DNA aptamers from vast libraries of trillions of random 80-mer DNAs. Senescent mouse adult fibroblasts and their non-senescent counterparts were employed for selection. We demonstrate aptamer specificity for senescent mouse cells in culture, identify a form of fibronectin as the molecular target of two selected aptamers, show increased aptamer staining in naturally aged mouse tissues, and demonstrate decreased aptamer staining when p16 expressing cells are removed in a transgenic INK-ATTAC mouse model. This work demonstrates the value of unbiased cell-based selections to identify new senescence-specific DNA reagents."
"In the past, development of tankyrase inhibitors has focused on the ADP-ribosyltransferase domain. Targeting tankyrases ability to interact with protein substrates through their ARC domains represents an alternative strategy to be explored as a therapeutic approach against specific protein-protein interactions. In this paper, we employed a FRET-based assay to identify ARC4-binding compounds by screening the EU-OPENSCREEN Pilot and Commercials Diversity libraries. We discovered an effective series of compounds with the same scaffold and through chemical synthesis we obtained the compound S8 (ARCher-142), which binds selectively to ARC4 with potency of 8 {micro}M. NMR analysis and X-ray crystallography allowed us to identify the binding site in ARC4 and to rationalize the observed selectivity. Despite binding exclusively to ARC4, the inhibitor can attenuate the WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway in cells. Our work demonstrates that targeting single ARC domains is possible, offering an inhibition approach tailored to tankyrase ARC4 inhibition.

SignificanceTankyrases impact a variety of cellular processes by binding proteins through their ARC domains and the inhibition of these scaffolding functions represents an alternative therapeutic approach to catalytic inhibitors. With a FRET-based high-throughput screening of the EU-OPENSCREEN Pilot and Commercials Diversity libraries we discovered a pyrrolone-based scaffold that is interestingly selective towards ARC4, despite the high conservation of the ARC binding site. Our synthesized compound S8 (ARCher-142) displays an 8 {micro}M potency for TNKS2 ARC4. With NMR and X-ray crystallography we demonstrate that S8 (ARCher-142) competes with the peptide optimized for binding and extends to a unique hydrophobic sub-pocket of ARC4. The compound attenuates the WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway in cells and interestingly offers the possibility to target specific protein-protein interactions mediated by ARC4, paving the way for the development of a pyrrolone-based class of tankyrase scaffolding inhibitors."
"Folate metabolism is intricately linked to purine de novo synthesis through the incorporation of folate-derived one-carbon units into the purine scaffold. Here, we investigate the chemical and genetic dependencies caused by mutations in the folate enzyme MTHFD1 and discover a key role for Nudix hydrolase 5 (NUDT5) in regulating purine de novo synthesis. Through genetic knockout and development of a selective chemical NUDT5 degrader, we uncover an unprecedented scaffolding role rather than NUDT5 enzymatic activity is responsible for this phenotype. We find that NUDT5 interacts with the rate-limiting enzyme of purine de novo synthesis, PPAT, to repress the pathway in response to elevated purine levels. Our findings establish NUDT5 as an important regulator of purine de novo synthesis and elucidate its role in mediating sensitivities to 6-thioguanine in cancer treatment and to adenosine in MTHFD1 deficiency."
"Bacteria frequently colonize natural microcavities such as gut crypts, plant apoplasts, and soil pores. Recent studies have shown that the physical structure of these spaces plays a crucial role in shaping the stability and resilience of microbial populations (1, 2). Here, we demonstrate that protected microhabitats can emerge dynamically, even in the absence of physical barriers. Interactions with surface features--such as roughness or friction--lead microbial populations to self-organize into effectively segregated subpopulations. Our numerical and analytical models reveal that this self-organization persists even when strains have different growth rates, allowing slower-growing strains to avoid competitive exclusion. These findings suggest that emergent spatial structuring can serve as a fundamental mechanism for maintaining microbial diversity, despite selection pressures, competition, and genetic drift."
"Hymenoptera is a megadiverse insect order, yet the drivers of its massive radiation remain poorly understood. Here, we employ novel comparative phylogenetic methods that integrate computational ontologies with ancestral state reconstructions of 346 discrete morphological characters to investigate the tempo and mode of phenome evolution in Hymenoptera across both adults and larvae. We examine the interplay between phenotypic rates, selection, modularity, and lineage diversification over deep time. Our analyses reveal that both larval and adult phenomes experienced an early burst scenario during the Late Permian - Triassic. However, their evolution appears decoupled, which enhanced the overall evolvability of Hymenoptera. Moreover, major phenotypic transitions in the order are complex, multifaceted processes driven by directional selection. One such event--the emergence of the wasp waist-- involved a fundamental reorganization of the adult phenome. This dramatic transformation shifted net diversification from negative to positive during the Triassic, thereby enabling the subsequent survival and explosive diversification of the apocritan lineage."
"The gut microbiome is a rich source of nutrients that are critical to the development and biology of eukaryotes. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are essential components of protein synthesis, and some chemical modifications to tRNA rely on the availability of microbiome-derived nutrients. In eukaryotes, the micronutrient queuosine (Q) is salvaged from the microbiome or diet and then incorporated into eukaryotic tRNA to influence the speed and efficiency of protein synthesis. Here, we examine the role of microbiome-derived Q in mosquito larval development and behavior. When mosquito larvae are grown with a microbiome incapable of synthesizing Q, there is a significant impact on tyrosine levels and processes, which correlate with defects in behavior and cuticle formation. Due to defects in movement and behavioral responses, Q-deficient larvae demonstrate impaired predator evasion, leading to higher instances of capture by predaceous beetle larvae. The broad effects of Q-deficiency in mosquito larvae highlight the importance of microbiome-derived nutrients for eukaryotic physiology and behavior."
"Salmonella is one of the most common foodborne pathogens, resulting in inflammatory gastroenteritis and frequently accompanied by dysbiosis. Gut commensals, such as Lactobacillus species, have been proven to exhibit broad anti-bacterial activities and protect hosts against pathogenic infections. Here, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus strain P118, screened from 290 isolates recovered from fermented yoghurts and healthy piglet intestines using traditional and Caenorhabditis elegans-infection screening strategies, exerts great probiotic properties. Notably, P118 and its supernatant exhibited great antibacterial activities and attenuated C. elegans susceptibility to Salmonella infection. We found that P118 protected mice against Salmonella lethal infections by enhancing colonization resistance, reducing pathogen invasion, alleviating intestinal pro-inflammatory response, and improving microbial dysbiosis and fecal metabolite changes. Microbiota and fecal metabolome analyses suggested P118 administration significantly decreased the relative abundances of potentially harmful microbes (e.g., Salmonella, Anaeroplasma, Klebsiella) and increased the fecal levels of tryptophan and its derivatives (indole, indole-3-acrylic acid, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-methoxyindoleacetate). Deterministic processes determined the gut microbial community assembly of P118-pretreated mice. Integrated omics further demonstrated that P118 probiotic activities in enhancing host tolerance to Salmonella infection were mediated by microbe-derived tryptophan/indole metabolites (e.g., indole-3-acrylic acid, indole, tryptophan, 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid, and 5-hydroxytryptophan). Collective results demonstrate that L. rhamnosus P118 could enhance host tolerance to Salmonella infections via various pathways, including direct antibacterial actions, inhibiting Salmonella colonization and invasion, attenuating pro-inflammatory responses of intestinal macrophages, and modulating gut microbiota mediated by microbe-derived indole metabolites."
"Environmental changes have impacted specialist species promoting their replacement by generalists, consequently driving functional homogenization with potential implications for ecosystem function. This problem is particularly relevant for plant-pollinator systems, where numerous rare and specialized species coexist with generalists. Prior research on pollinations role in plant coexistence shows conflicting results: Lotka-Volterra models suggest pollinators negatively impact coexistence by favoring abundant plants, while empirical studies of modular networks show positive effects through niche partitioning. Using a consumer-resource model and modern coexistence theory, we evaluated how nestedness and adaptive foraging affect plant coexistence in plant-pollinator networks through stabilizing mechanisms (increased intraspecific with respect of interspecific competition) and equalizing mechanisms (reduced fitness differences). Nestedness alone reduces coexistence by increasing fitness differences between generalist and specialist species. However, adaptive foraging promotes coexistence by eliminating these differences through equalizing the total visits generalists and specialists receive per plant. This redistribution of pollinator visits caused by adaptive foraging lowers the threshold of visit quality needed for species to persist, enhancing plant coexistence. Our findings show that when a consumer-resource approach is taken, modern coexistence theory supports a positive effect of animal pollination on plant coexistence via an equalizing effect on visits per plant of pollinators adaptive foraging."
"Visualizing phenotypic heterogeneity at single-cell resolution within dense microbial communities is technically challenging. Here, we present a method for visualizing this heterogeneity by combining spectrally compatible reporters to track the spatial distribution of gene expression in individual bacterial cells in the mammalian gut. Using toxin gene expression in Clostridioides difficile as a model for visualizing phenotypic heterogeneity, we demonstrate that, while C. difficile primarily occupies the lumen, a subpopulation of C. difficile associates with the colonic epithelium independent of toxin production. The approach further revealed that heterogeneity in C. difficile toxin gene expression is independent of location in the gut and unexpectedly showed that a toxin gene over-expressing mutant forms filamentous cells during the acute phase of infection. Thus, our reporter system provides quantitative, single-cell resolution of bacterial behavior within the intact gut environment and establishes a broadly applicable platform for investigating phenotypic heterogeneity in dense microbial communities."
"We present DynaVelo, a generative neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) model that learns the joint dynamics of gene expression and transcription factor (TF) motif activities in evolving cell systems using single-cell multiome data. DynaVelo leverages partial RNA velocity information together with single-cell TF motif accessibility data to improve the modeling of cell state dynamics and identification of TF drivers. We show that DynaVelo recovers the complex and bifurcating in vivo dynamics of wildtype murine germinal center (GC) B cells and reveals how these cell dynamics change under loss-of-function mutations in epigenetic regulators. DynaVelo resolves how TF motif activities evolve along latent time trajectories using analysis of training cells or through generated trajectories from the model. In silico perturbation analysis further enables DynaVelo to infer dynamic and cell-state-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs), recovering many known TF-to-gene edges in the wildtype GC GRN and predicting those that are disrupted in mutants. Finally, in silico gene and TF perturbations allow both the prediction of cell dynamics under loss-of-function genetic mutations and the identification of TF perturbations to rescue loss-of-function dynamic and immunological phenotypes. DynaVelo therefore provides a powerful new deep learning framework for modeling and perturbing dynamic cell systems by harnessing single-cell multiome data sets."
"Recent influenza vaccine formulations have improved the magnitude of B-cell antibody responses in older adults; however, older adults remain significantly at risk for severe influenza-related illness. Although antibodies are an important metric of vaccine effectiveness, they only represent one aspect of the immune response. In this study, we combined in vitro and ex vivo assays with human samples to investigate B, CD4+ T, and myeloid cell responses to influenza vaccine antigens. We found that older adults mounted equivalent antibody titers to younger adults but had fewer influenza-specific CD4+ T cells and reduced antiviral-associated T helper cell populations. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that older adults had attenuated interferon transcriptional signatures in T helper and myeloid cell subsets. These data suggest that with aging, transcriptional programming alterations in myeloid cells contribute to reduced antiviral T cell responses, and formulating vaccines tailored to myeloid responses is necessary to improve outcomes in older adults."
"Persons with HIV (PWH) receiving integrase (IN) strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) have been reported to experience virologic failure (VF) in the absence of resistance mutations in IN. We previously reported that mutations in the viral nucleocapsid (NC) are selected in the presence of the INSTI dolutegravir (DTG) and confer levels of INSTI resistance comparable to those conferred by clinically relevant IN mutations. Here we show that these NC mutations accelerate the kinetics of viral DNA integration. The shortened time frame between the completion of reverse transcription and integration correlates with reduced sensitivity to DTG, suggesting that NC mutations limit the window of opportunity for INSTIs to block viral DNA integration. We find that in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, HIV-1 acquires mutations in the viral envelope glycoprotein, NC, and occasionally IN during selection for INSTI resistance. Notably, the selected NC and IN mutations act in concert to reduce the susceptibility of the virus to INSTIs. These results provide insights into the mechanism by which HIV-1 escapes the inhibitory activity of INSTIs and underscore the importance of genotypic analysis outside IN in PWH experiencing VF on INSTI-containing drug regimens."
"Temperature profoundly impacts organismal physiology and ecological dynamics, particularly affecting ectothermic species and making them especially vulnerable to climate changes. Although complex physiological processes usually involve dozens of enzymes, empirically it is found that the rates of these processes often obey the Arrhenius equation, which was originally proposed for individual chemical reactions. Here we have examined the temperature scaling of the early embryonic cell cycle, with the goal of understanding why the Arrhenius equation approximately holds and why it breaks down at temperature extremes. Using experimental data from Xenopus laevis, Xenopus tropicalis, and Danio rerio, plus published data from Caenorhabditis elegans, Caenorhabditis briggsae, and Drosophila melanogaster, we find that the apparent activation energies (Ea values) for the early embryonic cell cycle for diverse ectotherms are all similar, 75 {+/-} 7 kJ/mol (mean {+/-} std.dev., n = 6), which corresponds to a Q10 value at 20{degrees}C of 2.8 {+/-} 0.2 (mean {+/-} std.dev., n = 6). Using computational models, we find that the approximate Arrhenius scaling and the deviations from it at high and low temperatures can be accounted for by biphasic temperature scaling in critical individual components of the cell cycle oscillator circuit, by imbalances in the Ea values for different partially rate-determining enzymes, or by a combination of both. Experimental studies of cycling Xenopus extracts indicate that both of these mechanisms contribute to the general scaling of temperature, and in vitro studies of individual cell cycle regulators confirm that there is in fact a substantial imbalance in their Ea values. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the dynamic interplay between temperature and complex biochemical processes, and into why biological systems fail at extreme temperatures."
"Ribosome profiling has become an essential tool for studying mRNA translation in cells with codon-level resolution. However, its widespread application remains hindered by the labour-intensive workflow, low efficiency and high costs associated with sequencing sample preparation. Here, we present a new cost-effective and ultra-sensitive library preparation method that significantly advances the applicability of ribosome profiling. By implementing bead-coupled enzymatic reactions and product purifications, our approach increases both yield and throughput while maintaining high reproducibility. Demonstrating the sensitivity of the protocol we prepared libraries from as little as 12 fmol of RNA, which expands the feasibility of ribosome profiling from minimal input samples, such as derived from small populations, stressed cells, or patient-derived specimens. Additionally, we validate the versatility of the protocol across multiple species and demonstrate its applicability for RNA-seq library preparation. Altogether, this protocol provides a highly accessible and efficient alternative to existing ribosome profiling workflows, facilitating research in previously challenging experimental contexts."
"Temporal interference stimulation (TIS) has attracted increasing attention as a promising noninvasive electrical stimulation method. Despite positive results and optimistic expectations, the TIS field has been beset by misunderstandings concerning its mechanism of action and efficacy in safely targeting deep neural structures. Various studies posit that TIS exploits the low-frequency ""beat"" frequency produced by interference of multiple kHz carriers to essentially deliver low-frequency stimulation at the intersection of the carriers, thereby circumventing limitations associated with tissue impedance and depth penetration. Due to the documented electrophysiological effects of kHz-range stimuli, such a picture is an oversimplification, and at present a critical open question for TIS is how much stimulation thresholds practically differ for amplitude-modulated versus unmodulated kHz stimuli. This paper presents experimental evidence supporting the conclusion that TIS is driven by the kHz carrier itself, and that amplitude modulation frequency has little relatively effect on thresholds. We test TIS and different modulated/unmodulated kHz waveforms on peripheral nerve targets in an invertebrate model (Locusta migratoria), and on sensory and motor stimulation in human subjects. We find that modulated (TIS) and unmodulated sine carrier frequencies in the range 0.5 - 12.5 kHz in humans, and further up to 100 kHz in locusts, demonstrate overlapping strength-frequency (s-f) dependence across all stimulation types. Since all stimulation waveforms are governed by the same s-f curve, this implicates a common underlying biophysical mechanism. This equivalence challenges the notion that the TIS modulated ""envelope"" frequency can uniquely facilitate neural engagement via other mechanisms. We test amplitude-modulation frequency (AMF) dependence, confirming the resonance effect predicted by kHz rectification theory, and we evaluate the regions of tonic (unmodulated) and phasic (amplitude-modulated) stimulation regions inherent when using TIS. Our results help to resolve the mechanistic debate, at least for suprathreshold TIS. We explain how the findings can be extrapolated to subthreshold stimulation, and further suggest possible advantages of using 2-electrode amplitude-modulated kHz waveforms over the multielectrode TIS configurations."
"Enhancer translocations, due to 3q26 rearrangements, drive out-of-context MECOM expression in an aggressive subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Direct depletion of MECOM using an endogenous auxin-inducible degron immediately upregulates expression of myeloid differentiation factor CEBPA. MECOM depletion is also accompanied by a severe loss of stem cells and gain of differentiation. MECOM exerts its inhibitory effect by binding to the +42kb CEBPA enhancer, a gene essential for neutrophil development. This is partially dependent on the interaction between MECOM and its co-repressor CTBP2. We demonstrate that CEBPA overexpression can bypass the MECOM-mediated block of differentiation. In addition, AML patients with MECOM overexpression through enhancer hijacking show significantly reduced CEBPA. Our study directly connects two main players of myeloid transformation MECOM and CEBPA, and it provides insight into the mechanism by which MECOM maintains the stem cell state in a unique subtype of AML by inactivating CEBPA."
"O_LIThe plant family Euphorbiaceae are an abundant source of structurally complex diterpenoids, many of which have reported anti-cancer, anti-HIV, and anti-inflammatory activities. Among these, ingenol-3-angelate (1a; tradename: Picato(R)), isolated from Euphorbia peplus, has potent anti-tumour activity.
C_LIO_LIHere we report the discovery and characterization of the first genes linked to the committed steps of ingenol-3-angelate (1a) biosynthesis in Euphorbia peplus. We identified two genes, the products of which catalyse the addition of angelyl-CoA (9a) to the ingenol (5) scaffold to produce ingenol-3-angelate (1a).
C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate using VIGS that just one of these genes, EpBAHD-08, is essential for this angeloylation in E. peplus. VIGS of the second gene, EpBAHD-06, has a significant effect on jatrophanes rather than ingenanes in E. peplus.
C_LIO_LIWe also identified three genes whose products can catalyse acetylation of ingenol-3-angelate (1a) to ingenol-3-angelate-20-acetate (2). In this case VIGS indicates considerable functional redundancy in the E. peplus genome of genes encoding this enzymatic step.
C_LIO_LIThis work paves the way for increasing ingenol-3-angelate (1a) levels in planta and provides a foundation for the discovery of the remaining genes in the biosynthetic pathway of these important molecules.

"CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is essential for chromatin organization. CTCF interacts with endogenous RNAs, and deletion of its ZF1 RNA-binding region ({Delta}ZF1) disrupts chromatin loops in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, the functional significance of CTCF-ZF1 RNA interactions during cell differentiation is unknown. Using an ESC-to-neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation model, we show that CTCF-ZF1 is crucial for maintaining cell-type-specific chromatin loops. Expression of CTCF-{Delta}ZF1 leads to disrupted loops and dysregulation of genes within these loops, particularly those involved in neuronal development and function. We identified NPC-specific, CTCF-ZF1 interacting RNAs. Truncation of two such coding RNAs, Podxl and Grb10, disrupted chromatin loops in cis, similar to the disruption seen in CTCF-{Delta}ZF1 expressing NPCs. These findings underscore the inherent importance of CTCF-ZF1 RNA interactions in preserving cell-specific genome structure and cellular identity.

"The search for the underlying genetic contributions to complex traits and diseases relies on accurate genetic data from populations of interest. Outbred populations, like the Diversity Outbred (DO), are commonly genotyped using commercial SNP arrays, such as the Giga Mouse Universal Genotyping Array (GigaMUGA). However, array genotypes are expensive to collect, subject to significant ascertainment bias, and too sparse to capture the genetic structure of highly recombined mouse crosses. We investigated the efficacy of sequencing-based genotyping by comparing genotyping results between the GigaMUGA, double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq), and low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (lcWGS). We aligned reads at [~]1X coverage and imputed segregating SNPs from the eight DO founder strains onto 48 DO genomes and reconstructed their haplotypes using R/qtl2. Haplotype reconstructions derived from all three methods were highly concordant. However, lcWGS more faithfully recapitulated crossover counts and identified more small (< 1 Mb) haplotype blocks at as low as 0.1X coverage. Over 90% of local expression quantitative trait loci identified in a set of 183 DO-derived embryoid bodies using the GigaMUGA were recalled by lcWGS at coverages as low as 0.1X. We recommend that lcWGS be adopted as the primary method of genotyping complex crosses, and cell-based resources derived from them because they are as accurate as array-based reconstructions, robust to ultra-low sequencing depths, may more accurately model haplotypes of the mouse genome that are difficult to resolve with dense reference data, and cost-effective."
"BackgroundCurrently, the link between cardiovascular diseases and sarcopenia is increasingly garnering attention from researchers. However, studies exploring the association between cardiac structure and sarcopenia are sparse. This study aims to investigate the potential genetic links between cardiac structural features and sarcopenia.

MethodsDuring the discovery phase, we employed Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) and Mendelian Randomization (MR) to assess the genetic correlation and causality between traits related to cardiac structure and sarcopenia, with further validation of the results using validation set data. In the study, we established a scoring system to identify high-confidence trait pairs. For these pairs, we conducted sensitivity analyses to assess their heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Additionally, we undertook follow-up studies of these trait pairs, including using mediation analysis to evaluate the potential mediating effects of lipids, and enrichment analysis to explore possible shared biological pathways linking these characteristics.

ResultsThe genetic correlation analyses during the discovery and validation phases identified 5 pairs (in forward analysis) and 16 pairs (in reverse analysis) of high-confidence trait pairs. As a key sarcopenia-related feature, appendicular lean mass (ALM) exhibited positive causal relationships with several cardiac structural features, including the volumes of the left and right atria. Mediation analysis suggested that certain lipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, might mediate these causal relationships. Notably, gene and pathway enrichment analyses revealed that genes associated with significant SNPs in high-confidence trait pairs were enriched in multiple key biological processes and pathways, such as tube morphogenesis, cardiac right ventricle morphogenesis, and muscle system processes in the forward analysis, as well as skeletal system development, heart development, and hemopoiesis in the reverse analysis. Cell-type enrichment analysis pointed to endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and mesenchymal stem cells.

ConclusionsThis study provides evidence for genetic relationships between cardiac structures and sarcopenia-related traits. These findings may enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying age-related diseases and provide scientific basis for developing future preventive and therapeutic strategies."
"Accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions remains a cornerstone challenge in drug discovery. AlphaFold3 (AF3), a recent breakthrough Diffusion Transformer model, holds significant promise for structural biology, but its performance across diverse pharmaceutical applications requires systematic evaluation. In this study, we comprehensively benchmark AF3s capabilities using carefully curated datasets, examining its performance in binary protein-ligand complexes, apo/holo structural variations, GPCR-ligand conformations, ternary systems, and inhibitor affinity prediction.

Our analysis reveals that AF3 excels at predicting static protein-ligand interactions with minimal conformational changes, significantly outperforming traditional docking methods in side-chain orientation accuracy. However, we identify critical limitations: AF3 struggles with protein-ligand complexes involving significant conformational changes (>5[A] RMSD), demonstrates a persistent bias toward active GPCR conformations regardless of ligand type, performs poorly on ternary complex prediction, and lacks reliable affinity ranking capability. Notably, AF3s performance declined significantly on structures released after its training cutoff date, suggesting potential memorization rather than physical understanding of molecular interactions.

We explored AF3s practical utility through applications in chemoproteomics data interpretation, drug resistance mutation prediction, and kinome profiling simulation. AF3 demonstrated value as a ""true-hit binary interaction modeler,"" capable of generating reliable structural models for experimentally validated binding pairs. However, its ranking metrics showed minimal correlation with experimental binding affinities and limited ability to differentiate across the kinome, highlighting the need for integration with physics-based scoring methods.

Our findings indicate that while AF3 represents a significant advancement in protein-ligand structure prediction, it requires complementary approaches to address its limitations in conformational sampling, affinity ranking, and complex system modeling. Recent developments like YDS Ternoplex suggest that enhanced sampling techniques can overcome some of these limitations. The optimal strategy for leveraging AF3 in drug discovery likely involves its integration into hybrid computational pipelines that combine AI-based prediction with physics-based refinement and experimental validation."
"Cleptobiosis, the act of raiding other species to obtain food or resources, is widespread among animals but rarely obligatory. The eusocial stingless bee Lestrimelitta limao is one of the few species that depend entirely on cleptobiosis, raiding other stingless bee colonies for survival. To investigate the molecular basis and evolutionary adaptations associated with this specialized lifestyle, we compared the transcriptomes of foraging workers of L. limao and three non-robber stingless bees - Nannotrigona testaceicornis, Scaptotrigona aff. depilis, and Tetragonisca angustula.

Our analysis revealed that differentially expressed orthologs were predominantly downregulated in L. limao workers, suggesting reduced transcriptional activity during foraging in this species. These downregulated genes fall into three major functional categories potentially linked to cleptobiotic adaptations: (1) detoxification and chemoreception genes, including cytochrome P450s and odorant receptors, indicating decreased exposure to phytochemicals; (2) neuronal and synaptic genes, such as para and Dys, possibly reflecting neurophysiological modifications; and (3) mitochondrial and carbohydrate metabolism genes, suggesting lower energetic demands. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms shaping cleptobiotic behavior in eusocial bees."
"Despite recent advances in error rate reduction, until recently Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequences lacked the accuracy required for fine scale bacterial genomic analysis. Here, recent software improvements of ONT and the ONT-cgMLST-Polisher within the SeqSphere+ software were evaluated.

We used short-(Illumina) and long-read ONT sequences of 80 multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDROs) for benchmarking. Illumina reads were de-novo-assembled using SKESA. For ONT, Dorado super accurate (SUP) model 4.3 or 5.0 basecalled reads were assembled with Flye and then polished with Medaka v1.12 m4.3 or Medaka v2.0 bacterial methylation model. In addition, the ONT-cgMLST-Polisher was run over all assemblies. The  ground truth (GT) hybrid assemblies were created using Hybracter v0.10.0. Sixteen isolates from four species out of the original 80 isolates were sent to six laboratories for a ring trial.

The 80 MDROs basecalled with SUP m4.3 had an average cgMLST allele distance (AD) to the GT of 4.94 with Medaka v1.12 and 1.78 with Medaka v2.0, respectively. After further polishing the Medaka v2.0 data with the ONT-cgMLST-Polisher, the AD dropped to 0.09. Using data basecalled with SUP m5.0 with Medaka v2.0 further reduced the AD significantly to 0.04. While the ring trial data basecalled with Dorado SUP m4.3 showed more variability and insufficient results for some samples, model 5.0 data resulted in average ADs of 0.36 and 0.17 without and with the ONT-cgMLST-Polisher, respectively. In conclusion, recent ONT Dorado and Medaka models combined with the ONT-cgMLST-Polisher improved ONT sequencing accuracy and made it sufficiently reproducible for genomic surveillance of bacteria.

Importance

Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing methodology is especially attractive for small and medium-sized laboratories due to its relatively low capital investment and price per sample consumable costs. However, until recently it lacked accuracy and reproducibility for bacterial genomic genotyping. Here, we present an evaluation of the most recent ONT bioinformatic (basecalling and polishing of consensus) improvements and a new ONT-cgMLST-Polisher tool. We demonstrate that by applying those procedures ONT whole-genome genotyping-based surveillance of bacteria is finally accurate and reproducible enough for routine application even in small laboratories"
"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCell migration, both in vivo and in vitro, is a complex process governed by mechano-chemical interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). These interactions, mediated by cell membrane receptors called integrins, involve bidirectional signaling between the intracellular actin cytoskeleton and the ECM. Integrins bind with cytoplasmic proteins to form adhesion complexes of varying sizes and maturity, which play crucial roles in cellular processes such as cell migration. Among these complexes are nascent adhesions-the smallest and earliest observable structures that emerge within the lamellipodium and are associated with rapid cell motility. While other adhesion types have been extensively studied, the mechanisms regulating nascent adhesions remain poorly understood.

Here, we develop a mathematical model describing the bidirectional signaling between the actin cytoskeleton and ECM that controls nascent adhesion dynamics. Our framework employs a system of delay differential equations to capture the temporal coupling between actin polymerization-driven adhesion formation and force-dependent ECM displacement. The model demonstrates that nascent adhesions, initiated by actin polymerization, exert forces on the ECM, whose delayed displacement provides negative feedback that limits adhesion growth. Numerical simulations reveal that this delayed ECM feedback mechanism reproduces the characteristic lifetime and dynamics of nascent adhesions, with quantitative agreement with experimental observations. Our results suggest that delayed ECM negative feedback is a key regulator of nascent adhesion turnover, providing new insights into the spatiotemporal control of cell migration."
"Chronically homeless adults (CHA) often face limited healthcare access, poor nutrition, frequent substance use, and close contact with stray animals. These factors can significantly alter their oral microenvironment. This study aimed to characterize the oral microbiota of this vulnerable and understudied population. We analyzed saliva samples from 60 chronically homeless men and 40 asymptomatic men with no history of homelessness, all living in Mexico City. DNA was extracted, and the V1-V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. Taxonomic classification was performed using human and non-human databases. Diversity metrics were calculated using the vegan v2.6-4 package in R, and informative species were identified through machine learning and statistical approaches. Microbial correlation networks were inferred using NetCoMi in RStudio. Bacterial diversity was significantly higher in the CHA group. While both groups shared 369 species, only eight were exclusive to the control group, and 149 were unique to CHA. Several of these taxa had never been reported in humans and are typically found in extreme environments. For example, Megasphaera cerevisiae, adapted to high ethanol and low pH, was the most abundant species. Syntrophocurvum alkaliphilum, from a hypersaline lake in Siberia, and Sinanaerobacter chloroacetimidivorans, from anaerobic bioreactors, were also prevalent. Marked differences in microbial network structure were observed between groups. These findings highlight the adaptability of extremophile bacteria to human environments under chronic stress and poor hygiene. This study provides a first look into the oral microbiota of individuals experiencing chronic homelessness, emphasizing the need for more research into marginalized populations."
"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by deficits in communication and social interaction and may stem from an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) signaling in neural circuits. Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons are crucial for maintaining E/I balance and regulating network oscillations. Alterations in the number of PV+ interneurons or reductions in PV expression have been observed in both the postmortem brains of individuals with ASD and in animal models, including those induced by in utero exposure to maternal brain-reactive antibodies. In this study, we investigate the impact of in utero exposure to maternal anti-Caspr2 IgG on PV+ interneuron development and function in the hippocampus. Our results demonstrate a selective reduction in PV+ interneurons and perisomatic inhibitory synapses in the hippocampal CA1 region of juvenile and adult male offspring exposed in utero to anti-Caspr2 antibodies compared to controls. Additionally, local field potential (LFP) recordings from these mice show increased gamma power and altered neuronal firing patterns during social interactions, indicating functional impairments in inhibitory circuitry. These findings highlight the consequences of exposure to maternal anti-Caspr2 antibodies on PV+ interneuron development and function, providing insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying ASD associated behavioral phenotypes."
"Innate immunity represents the first line of defence against viral infections, and successful pathogens like HIV-1 have evolved mechanisms to bypass these barriers. The PAF1 complex (PAF1c) has emerged as a key regulator of antiviral innate immune responses, inhibiting the replication of various viruses, including HIV-1. While its role in transcription regulation is well documented, little is known about how PAF1c inhibits HIV-1 and how HIV-1 circumvents this antiviral activity. Here we demonstrate that Vpr induces the rapid and transient downmodulation of PAF1c shortly after infection, a process that correlates with significant transcriptomic changes within the host cell. Transcriptomic profiling reveals that PAF1 knockdown mirrors many of the gene expression changes induced by HIV-1 infection, indicating that Vpr antagonism of PAF1c is a means by which HIV-1 may modulate host gene expression to favour replication. Further, we show that the loss of PAF1c leads to the suppression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and several known HIV-1 restriction factors. Overall, the evidence supports the emerging role of PAF1 as a regulator of a broad antiviral transcriptional program, but also suggests a specific anti-HIV activity that is countered by HIV-1 Vpr."
"Separase is a well conserved endopeptidase that facilitates sister chromatid separation at the metaphase-anaphase transition by cleaving cohesins. Beyond its role in chromosome segregation, Separase also participates in various biological processes, including chromatin organization and replication, centrosome disengagement and duplication, cytokinesis, and telomere capping. Here, we report that the loss of Drosophila separase (Sse) function induces significant changes in global protein expression and affects the protein levels of both A/C-type lamin C (LamC) and B-type lamin Dm0 (Dm0). We further demonstrate that SSE physically interacts with lamins and colocalizes with them at the nuclear envelope during interphase. Additionally, loss of SSE activity disrupts nuclear organization in larval muscles and impairs locomotion in adult flies. Notably, similar to SSE in flies, depletion of human separase (ESPL1) in SV40 fibroblasts leads to misshapen nuclei and increased levels of lamin A. Moreover, we show that ESPL1 interacts with lamin A in human fibroblasts, suggesting that the functional interaction between Separase and lamins is evolutionarily conserved across different organisms."
"BackgroundUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition that predisposes patients to colorectal cancer (CRC) through mechanisms that remain largely undefined. Given the pivotal role of cellular senescence in both chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis, we integrated machine learning and bioinformatics approaches to identify senescence{square}related biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets involved in the progression from UC to CRC.

MethodsGene expression profiles from six GEO datasets were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the limma package in R. Weighted gene co expression network analysis (WGCNA) was employed to delineate modules significantly associated with UC and CRC, and the intersection of DEGs, key module genes, and senescence related genes from the CellAge database yielded 112 candidate genes. An integrated machine learning (IML) model, utilizing 12 algorithms with 10 fold cross validation was constructed to pinpoint key diagnostic biomarkers. The diagnostic performance of the candidate genes was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses in both training and validation cohorts. In addition, immune cell infiltration, protein protein interaction (PPI) networks, and drug enrichment analyses, including molecular docking were performed to further elucidate the biological functions and therapeutic potentials of the identified genes.

ResultsOur analysis revealed significant transcriptomic alterations in UC and CRC tissues, with the turquoise module demonstrating the strongest association with disease traits. The IML approach identified five pivotal genes (ABCB1, CXCL1, TACC3, TGFBI, and VDR) that individually exhibited AUC values >0.7, while their combined diagnostic model achieved an AUC of 0.989. Immune infiltration analyses uncovered distinct immune profiles correlating with these biomarkers, and the PPI network confirmed robust interactions among them. Furthermore, drug enrichment and molecular docking studies identified several promising therapeutic candidates targeting these senescence{square}related genes.

ConclusionsThis study provides novel insights into the molecular interplay between cellular senescence and the UC to CRC transition. The identified biomarkers not only offer strong diagnostic potential but also represent promising targets for therapeutic intervention, paving the way for improved clinical management of UC associated CRC."
"BackgroundUnderstanding how sensory stimuli are represented across different brains, species, and artificial neural networks is a critical topic in neuroscience. Traditional methods for comparing these representations typically rely on supervised alignment, which assumes direct correspondence between stimuli representations across brains or models. However, it has limitations when this assumption is not valid, or when validating the assumption itself is the goal of the research.

New methodTo address the limitations of supervised alignment, we propose an unsupervised alignment method based on Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport (GWOT). GWOT optimally identifies correspondences between representations by leveraging internal relationships without external labels, revealing intricate structural correspondences such as one-to-one, group-to-group, and shifted mappings.

ResultsWe provide a comprehensive methodological guide and introduce a toolbox called GWTune for using GWOT in neuroscience. Our results show that GWOT can reveal detailed structural distinctions that supervised methods may overlook. We also demonstrate successful unsupervised alignment in key data domains, including behavioral data, neural activity recordings, and artificial neural network models, demonstrating its flexibility and broad applicability.

Comparison with existing methodsUnlike traditional supervised alignment methods such as Representational Similarity Analysis, which assume direct correspondence between stimuli, GWOT provides a nuanced approach that can handle different types of structural correspondence, including fine-grained and coarse correspondences. Our method would provide richer insights into the similarity or difference of representations by revealing finer structural differences.

ConclusionWe anticipate that our work will significantly broaden the accessibility and application of unsupervised alignment in neuroscience, offering novel perspectives on complex representational structures. By providing a user-friendly toolbox and a detailed tutorial, we aim to facilitate the adoption of unsupervised alignment techniques, enabling researchers to achieve a deeper understanding of cross-brain and cross-species representation analysis."
"Pubertal development is tightly regulated by energy balance. The crosstalk between metabolism and reproduction is orchestrated by complex neural networks and leptin action in the hypothalamus plays a critical role. The ventral premammillary nucleus (PMv) leptin receptor (LepRb) neurons act as an essential relay for leptin action on reproduction. Here, we show that mouse PMv cells expressing the dopamine transporter (DAT) gene, Slc6a3 (PMvDAT) form a novel subpopulation of LepRb neurons. Virtually all PMvDAT neurons expressed Lepr mRNA and responded to acute leptin treatment. Electrophysiological recordings from DATCRE;tdTomato mice showed that PMvDAT cells in prepubertal females have a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential compared to diestrous females. Slc6a3 mRNA expression in the PMv was higher in prepubertal than in adult females. In prepubertal females Slc6a3 mRNA expression was higher in overnourished females from small size litters than in controls. Prepubertal Lepob females showed decreased PMv Slc6a3 mRNA expression, that recovered to control levels after 3 days of leptin injections. Using a tracer adenoassociated virus in the PMv of adult DATCre;Kiss1hrGFP females, we observed PMvDAT projections in the anteroventral periventricular and periventricular nucleus (AVPV/PeN), surrounding Kiss1hrGFP neurons, a population critical for sexual maturation and positive estrogen feedback in females. The DATCRE;tdTomato projections to the AVPV were denser in adult than in prepubertal females. In adults, they surrounded tyrosine hydroxylase neurons. Overall, these findings suggest that the DAT expressing PMvLepRb subpopulation play a role in leptin regulation of sexual maturation via actions on AVPV kisspeptin/tyrosine hydroxylase neurons.

Significance StatementWomen with excess or low energy stores (e.g., obesity or anorexia) have reproductive deficits, including altered puberty onset, disruption of reproductive cycles and decreased fertility. If able to conceive, they show higher risks of miscarriages and preterm birth. The hypothalamic circuitry controlling the interplay between metabolism and reproduction is poorly defined. Neurons in the ventral premammillary nucleus express the leptin receptor and play a key role in the metabolic control of reproduction. Those neurons are functionally and phenotypically heterogeneous. Here we show that a subset of leptin-sensitive neurons co-expresses the dopamine transporter (DAT), is dynamically regulated during pubertal transition and with nutrition and projects to brain sites relevant for sexual maturation.

DAT gene expression is higher in prepubertal than in adults and is regulated by leptin in prepubertal females. Dynamic projections from PMvDAT cells contact the kisspeptin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) populations in the AVPV/PeN during puberty, a critical time for the appearance of these cells in the AVPV/PeN."
"Many polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based devices, e.g., organ-on-chip or microphysiological systems, have been developed to investigate biological processes at a miniaturized scale. These devices typically culture cells under microfluidic perfusion to dynamically dose cells with chemicals of interest; however, PDMS is known to interact with hydrophobic compounds and can strongly limit such compounds in-device bioavailability. Here, we quantify chemical-PDMS interactions for three commonly used steroid hormones: aldosterone, estradiol, and progesterone. We find that aldosterone does not detectably interact with PDMS; estradiol interacts modestly; and progesterone interacts strongly. Based on these measured interactions, we computationally model dynamic dosing protocols based on pulsed/bolus delivery and circadian control. We show that interactions with PDMS can strongly disrupt these dynamic dosing protocols in a chemical-specific and flow-rate-dependent manner. These results have critical implications for the use of steroid hormones in PDMS-based devices."
"Fish herpesviruses, members of the family Alloherpesviridae, infect aquatic species. The hosts ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) serves as the major intracellular pathway for protein degradation and plays a crucial role in the viral replication cycle. Viruses exploit the UPS to facilitate their replication and evade host immune responses. This study demonstrated that cyprinid herpesvirus 2 (CyHV-2) infection significantly activates the host UPS pathway, as revealed by transcriptomics sequencing analysis. Further, treatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, markedly downregulates intracellular viral replication and gene transcription. Additionally, we identified a novel, highly conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase with a C3HC4-type really interesting gene (RING)-finger (RING-HC) domain, encoded by open reading frame 150 (ORF150) of CyHV-2. These findings provide critical molecular evidence that the host UPS is essential for fish herpesvirus replication and suggest that viral E3 ligases may serve as potential targets for new antiviral strategies."
"The recent expansion of oil palm plantations in Southeast Asia has caused significant range loss for many species. We examined the impact of this expansion on mammal distribution in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Using historical range maps (1970s-1980s) and satellite imagery of oil palm plantations (1981 to 2017), we quantified the extent of species lost and retained ranges occupied by oil palm plantations before and after 1990. The siamang (+24%), tiger (+19%), and large-spotted civet (+14%) were the most impacted, considering plantations expansion in the lost range. All species, including endemic ones, have also seen an increase in their current range. Additionally, we found a significant correlation between the amount of range lost and the area occupied by plantations after 1990. Our findings underscore the urgent need for sustainable land management and conservation strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of agricultural expansion on biodiversity."
"Cave crickets (Orthoptera: Rhaphidophoridae) are a globally distributed group of insects found in dark, humid microhabitats including natural caves, alpine scree, and forest litter. Ten extant subfamilies are currently recognised and Macropathinae, which comprises the entirety of the fauna in South America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, is thought to be the most ancient of these. The New Zealand rhaphidophorid fauna comprises high phylogenetic diversity throughout its mesic zone, with most species occurring above-ground. In contrast, the Australian fauna is poorly known, with an apparently greater relative proportion of species utilising caves as refugia. A robust phylogenetic framework is needed to underpin future taxonomic work on the group and potentially contrasting patterns of taxonomic diversity within Macropathinae. Here, we performed fossil-calibrated phylogenetic analysis using whole mitochondrial genomes and nuclear markers to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Macropathinae, with a focus on the Australian fauna. By dramatically increasing taxon sampling relative to past studies, we recovered the Australian fauna as rampantly polyphyletic, with the remaining Macropathinae nested amongst six distinct Australian lineages. Deep divergences between major clades imply additional Australian lineages remain undetected, either due to extinction or sampling bias, and have likely confounded past biogeographic signal. We inferred the radiation of Macropathinae began during the Lower Cretaceous prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana with a potential Pangaean origin for Rhaphidophoridae. Finally, we found evidence for several undescribed taxa of Australian Rhaphidophoridae, all of which qualify as short-range endemics, and discuss the conservation implications of these restricted distributions."
"T cells are critical effector cells against infections and malignancies. To achieve this, they produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-{gamma} and TNF. Cytokine production is a tightly regulated process. The relative contribution of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation to mRNA expression is, however, unknown. We therefore optimized single-molecule FISH for primary human T cells (T-cell smFISH) to simultaneously quantify nascent RNA, mature mRNA levels and its localization with single-cell resolution. T-cell smFISH uncovered heterogeneous cytokine mRNA levels, with high cytokine producers displaying biallelic IFNG/TNF RNA transcription activity. Throughout activation, nuclear cytokine mRNAs accumulated, whereas cytoplasmic cytokine mRNA was degraded through translation-dependent decay. Lastly, T-cell smFISH uncovered cytokine-specific regulation by the RNA-binding protein HuR. Thus, T-cell smFISH provides novel insights in the intricate (post)-transcriptional processes in T cells."
"The evolution of aposematism, in which prey exhibit conspicuous signals indicating the presence of anti-predator defenses, is puzzling. Before predators learn to associate the signal with defense, increased visibility makes the conspicuous prey highly vulnerable to predation. Although several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of aposematism, they often assume that these signals can only be recognized by predators. Yet, many studies show that aposematic signals can also be involved in mate choice. Here, we demonstrate that some aposematic signals may have originally evolved as mating signals driven by sexual selection. In this study, we analyze a mathematical model to explore how sexual selection can drive the evolution of aposematism. We thereby identify key features of this  sexual selection hypothesis for the origin of aposematism to be tested with empirical data. Our results show that the evolution of conspicuous signals through sexual selection increases the visibility of prey to predators and thus predation pressure. This, in turn, promotes the evolution of defense mechanisms, ultimately leading to aposematism when predators learn to associate the signal with defense. Additionally, we show that when sexual selection drives the evolution of aposematism, it often results in sexual dimorphism in both signaling and defense traits."
"Goats were among the earliest managed animals, making them a natural model to explore the genetic consequences of domestication. However, a challenge in ancient genomic analysis is the relatively low genome coverage for most samples, limiting analysis to pseudohaploid genotypes. Genotype imputation offers potential to alleviate this limitation by improving information content and accuracy in low coverage genomes. To test this we used published high coverage (>8x) goat palaeogenomes, imputing downsampled genomes using the VarGoats dataset (1,372 individuals) as a reference panel. Measuring concordance between imputed and high coverage genotypes, we find high concordance after filtering for common (>5%), high confidence variants, with 0.5x genomes reaching >0.97 concordance. There is a trade-off between coverage, genotype probability (GP) thresholds, and genotype recovery, where higher coverage and more lenient GP thresholds result in higher recovery, and a reduction in heterozygous false positive rates with stricter thresholds. We then imputed 36 goat palaeogenomes with [&ge;]0.5x coverage to examine runs-of-homozygosity (ROH) and identity-by-descent (IBD) patterns. Using a novel approach combining ROH profiles across tools, we find that among Neolithic goats, ROH increases with distance from the Zagros Mountains, suggesting a large effect of the initial dispersal of managed herds. Inbreeding levels decrease across Southwest Asia in more recent periods. IBD mirrored this pattern, with less relatedness in the early herding site of Ganj Dareh compared to higher relatedness in goats from later in the dispersal process. These findings provide insights into the genetic consequences of early goat management on demography, and confirm the utility of imputation in leveraging low coverage palaeogenomes."
"Hundreds of mitochondrial-destined proteins rely on N-terminal presequences for organellar targeting and import. While generally described as positively charged amphipathic helices, presequences lack a consensus motif and thus likely promote the import of proteins into mitochondria with variable efficiencies. Indeed, the concept of presequence ""strength"" critically underlies biological models such as stress sensing, yet a quantitative analysis of what dictates ""strong"" versus ""weak"" presequences is lacking. Furthermore, the extent to which presequence strength affects mitochondrial function and cellular fitness remains unclear. Here, we capitalize on the high-throughput and kinetic nature of the MitoLuc mitochondrial protein import assay to quantify multiple aspects of presequence strength. We find that select presequences, including those that regulate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), are sufficient to impart differential import efficiencies during mitochondrial uncoupling. Surprisingly, we find that presequences beyond those classically associated with stress signaling promote highly variable import efficiency in stressed and basal (i.e., non-stressed) conditions in vitro, suggesting that presequence strength may influence a broader array of processes than currently appreciated. We exploit this variability to demonstrate that only presequences that promote robust import in vitro can fully rescue defects in respiratory growth in Complex IV-deficient yeast, suggesting that presequence strength dictates metabolic potential. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that presequence strength can describe numerous metrics, such as total imported protein, maximal import velocity, or sensitivity to uncoupling, suggesting that the annotation of presequences as ""weak"" versus ""strong"" requires more nuanced characterization than is typically performed. Importantly, we find that such variability in presequence strength meaningfully affects cellular fitness in processes beyond stress signaling, suggesting that organisms may broadly exploit presequence strength to fine-tune mitochondrial import and thus organellar homeostasis."

The software is open-source, cross-platform, and freely available at https://pypi.org/project/revolutionhtl/, providing a robust solution for large-scale evolutionary analyses in comparative genomics.

Author summaryComparative genomics relies on understanding how genes evolve across species. This involves identifying groups of related genes, reconstructing their evolutionary trees, and aligning them with the evolutionary history of species. These steps are typically performed using multiple tools, often requiring manual integration and technical expertise.

We present REvolutionH-tl, an open-source software that automates the entire evolutionary reconstruction process--starting from protein sequences and producing gene trees, species trees, orthology assignments, and reconciled evolutionary scenarios. Unlike existing tools, REvolutionH-tl also includes built-in, high-quality visualizations that help users interpret complex evolutionary events such as gene duplications and losses.

We evaluated REvolutionH-tl on simulated genomes with known evolutionary histories and found that it matches or exceeds the performance of widely used tools, while being significantly faster. Its visual output makes evolutionary analysis more accessible and interpretable, offering a valuable resource for researchers studying genome evolution."
"Spatial transcriptomics has emerged as a powerful tool to define the cellular structure of diverse tissues. One such method is multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH). MERFISH identifies RNAs with error tolerant optical barcodes generated through sequential rounds of single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH). MERFISH performance depends on a variety of protocol choices, yet their effect on performance has yet to be systematically examined. Here we explore a variety of properties to identify optimal choices for probe design, hybridization, buffer storage, and buffer composition. In each case, we introduce protocol modifications that can improve performance, and we show that, collectively, these modified protocols can improve MERFISH quality in both cell culture and tissue samples. As RNA FISH-based methods are used in many different contexts, we anticipate that the optimization experiments we present here may provide empirical design guidance for a broad range of methods."
"Experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) is an active-immunization model that was first discovered by coincidence when rabbits injected with purified acetylcholine receptor for neuromuscular junction physiology studies, suddenly developed muscle weakness. In mice, this model typically involves bilateral subcutaneous injections of purified torpedo acetylcholine receptor (tAChR) in the hind footpads and the scapular regions, followed by one or two booster immunizations in the thighs and over the scapulas. However, footpad injections can cause severe discomfort and progressive debilitation. Hock immunization has shown to be a viable alternative in other models, offering comparable efficacy without impairing mobility caused by inflammation, thus reducing discomfort.

To investigate the use of hock immunization in the mouse EAMG model, 7-week-old female C57BL6/6J (B6) mice were bilaterally injected over the scapulas and either in the hocks or footpads for the primary immunization. All animals received a booster immunization 4 weeks later, following standard guidelines.

Inverted mesh measurements demonstrated that tAChR-immunized animals whether receiving hock or footpad injections, exhibited similar muscle weakness. This weakness correlated with reduced body weight, which reached statistical significance, only in the hock-immunized group. tAChR antibodies were detectable in both groups 4 weeks after primary immunization and continue raising until the end of the experiment. Additionally, tAChR immunized mice required significantly less curare to achieve decrement in muscle response. Notably, hock-immunized mice displayed consistent mechanical sensitivity over time, which was significantly lower compared to footpad-immunized mice.

In conclusion, hock-immunization is a refined and effective alternative for developing the EAMG mouse model. It results in similar disease incidence and severity while minimizing immunization-related discomfort compared to the standard footpad method."
"DNA segregation by bacterial ParABS systems is mediated by transient tethering interactions between nucleoid-bound dimers of the ATPase ParA and centromere (parS)-associated complexes of the clamp-forming CTPase ParB. The lifetime of these interactions is limited by the ParB-dependent activation of ParA ATPase activity. Here, we elucidate the functional interplay between ParA and ParB in the model bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. We demonstrate that the N-terminal ParA-binding motif of ParB associates with a conserved bipartite binding pocket at the ParA dimer interface, in a manner dependent on ParB clamp closure. Moreover, we show that ParB and non-specific DNA interact cooperatively with ParA and synergistically induce structural changes at its Walker A and Walker B motifs that correlate with the activation of ParA ATPase activity. These results advance our understanding of the mechanism underlying DNA transport by the ParABS system and may help to unravel the mode of action of related cargo-positioning systems."
"The study of network evolution is critical to understanding how complex biological processes arise and adapt over time. Protein networks, composed of interacting components, can exhibit varying degrees of conservation and flexibility, enabling organisms to fine-tune their responses to environmental changes. Using the circadian clock system in Drosophila as a case study, we explore how such networks evolve. We leverage the recently published 101 Drosophilidae genome project to analyze the evolution and co-evolution of 11 core clock proteins across 65 species spanning about 60 million years of evolution. A sliding window analysis of coding regions reveals substantial heterogeneity in nucleotide divergence, with Clk and per exhibiting high divergence, whereas Pdp1 and sgg show virtually no evolutionary change. Additionally, we assessed interdependent amino acid evolution across different proteins, identifying 67 co-evolving site pairs, primarily between CLK-PER, CLK-CWO, and SGG-PER. Using codon-based models of evolution we found four genes (cwo, jet, per, and sgg) showing evidence of positive selection. Since several clock proteins are pleiotropic, we tested whether their multifunctionality influences their evolutionary constraints. Using alternative approaches to assess pleiotropy, we found no significant correlation between pleiotropy and the non-synonymous substitution rate (Ka) in 440 Drosophila proteins, including circadian clock ones. Overall, our findings suggest that the circadian clock network does not impose strong constraints on the evolution of its components. This flexibility may facilitate species-specific adaptation of the clock and allow the pleiotropic functions of clock proteins."
"ObjectiveClear cell ovarian carcinoma (CCOC) is generally associated with a favourable prognosis, but up to 30% of low-stage cases relapse within five years. The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for low-stage CCOC (FIGO stage IA-IC1) remains uncertain. This study aimed to identify molecular and immune markers associated with relapse in a well-characterized CCOC cohort.

MethodsUsing the Edinburgh Ovarian Cancer Database, we identified 85 CCOC cases. Targeted DNA sequencing assessed genomic alterations and tumour immune infiltration was evaluated using CD3 and CD8 immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. Tumours were stratified by stage (IA-IC1, IC2-II, III-IV), and both univariate and multivariate analysis applied for progression-free survival (PFS) included stage, age, genomic features, and immune markers.

ResultsCommon genomic alterations included ARID1A (49%) and PIK3CA (42%) mutations, PIK3-AKT pathway perturbations (60%), and mismatch repair-related mutational signatures (25.9%). Genomic and molecular features were not significantly associated with tumour stage; however, low-stage tumours (IA-IC1) were enriched in CD3+ (40% cases) and CD8+ (29% cases) tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) compared to higher-stage tumours (IC2-II: 13%/7%; III-IV: 9%/0% cases). In univariate analysis, low CD3+ TIL levels were significantly associated with reduced progression-free survival (HR = 4.4, P = 0.042, 95% CI 1.1-18). ARID1A wild-type status was linked to poorer PFS but only in low-stage tumours HR = 7.2, P = 0.088; 95% CI 0.74-72). Notably, the combination of ARID1A wild-type status and CD3+ depletion identified a high-risk subgroup among low-stage CCOC cases (HR = 11.7, P = 0.050; 95% CI 1-138), highlighting potential as a composite risk marker set.

ConclusionsCombined ARID1A mutation and low CD3+ve TIL levels are suggestive of higher recurrence risk in low-stage CCOC patients. These findings support further investigation of targeted therapies or immune checkpoint inhibitors in larger CCOC cohorts.

"Sexual reproduction in basidiomycete fungi is governed by MAT loci (P/R and HD), which exhibit remarkable evolutionary plasticity, characterized by expansions, rearrangements, and gene losses often associated with mating system transitions. The sister genera Cryptococcus and Kwoniella provide a powerful framework for studying MAT loci evolution owing to their diverse reproductive strategies and distinct architectures, spanning bipolar and tetrapolar systems with either linked or unlinked MAT loci. Building on recent large-scale comparative genomic analyses, we generated additional chromosome-level assemblies uncovering distinct evolutionary trajectories shaping MAT loci organization. Contrasting with the small-scale expansions and gene acquisitions observed in Kwoniella, our analyses revealed independent expansions of the P/R locus in tetrapolar Cryptococcus, possibly driven by pheromone gene duplications. Notably, these expansions coincided with an enrichment of AT-rich codons and a pronounced GC-content reduction, likely associated with recombination suppression and relaxed codon usage selection. Diverse modes of MAT locus linkage were also identified, including three previously unrecognized transitions: one resulting in a pseudobipolar arrangement and two leading to bipolarity. All the three transitions involved translocations. In the pseudobipolar configuration, the P/R and HD loci remained on the same chromosome but genetically unlinked, whereas the bipolar transitions additionally featured rearrangements that fused the two loci into a nonrecombining region. Mating assays confirmed a sexual cycle in C. decagattii, demonstrating its ability to undergo mating and sporulation. Progeny analysis in K. mangrovensis revealed substantial ploidy variation and aneuploidy, likely stemming from haploid-diploid mating, yet evidence of recombination and loss of heterozygosity indicates that meiotic exchange occurs despite irregular chromosome segregation. Our findings underscore the importance of continued diversity sampling and provides further evidence for convergent evolution of fused MAT loci in basidiomycetes, offering new insights into the genetic and chromosomal changes driving reproductive transitions."
"The protein complex cohesin encircles the sister chromatids in early mitosis1. At anaphase onset, sister separation is triggered by cleavage of the cohesin subunit SCC1/RAD21 by the cysteine protease separase2-5. SCC1 contains two cleavage sites, where cleavage is stimulated by SCC1 phosphorylation5,6. The molecular mechanisms of substrate recognition and cleavage are only partly understood7. Here, we determined a series of cryoEM structures of human separase in apo-or substrate-bound forms that, together with biochemical analysis, provide novel insights into the regulation of separase cleavage activity. We verify the first SCC1 cleavage site and reassign the second site. We show that multiple substrates, including separase autocleavage sites8,9 and the two SCC1 cleavage sites, interact with several docking sites in separase, including four phosphate-binding sites. We also describe the structural basis of the interaction between the cohesin subunit SA1/A2 and separase, which promotes cleavage at the second site in SCC1. Finally, using cross-linking mass spectrometry and cryoEM, we propose a model of how cohesin is targeted by human separase. Our work provides an extensive functional and structural framework that explains one of the most fundamental events in cell division."
"SARS-CoV-2 variants have demonstrated the ability to evade immune responses, leading to waves of infection throughout the pandemic. In response, bivalent mRNA vaccines, encoding the original Wuhan-Hu-1 and emerging variants, were developed to display both spike antigens. To date, it has not been determined whether co-transfection and co-translation of different SARS-CoV-2 variants results in co-assembly of mosaic heterotrimer antigens and how this may affect trimer stability, dynamics, and antigenicity. Understanding whether such mosaic heterotrimers can form and their implications for antigen structure can provide important information to guide future polyvalent vaccine design where multiple variants of an antigen are co-formulated. To investigate this, we purified mosaic spike assemblies of both genetically close (Omicron BA.2 and XBB) and distant (Omicron BA.2 and Wuhan-Hu-1 G614) strains. We found that the stability and integrity of mosaic spike trimers were maintained without misfolding or aggregation. Glycosylation profiles likewise were preserved relative to the homotrimer counterparts. Hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry and biolayer-interferometry were used to investigate the mosaic spike dynamics and any impact on epitope presentation and receptor binding. The Omicron-XBB heterotrimer, sharing a common fusion subunit sequence, retained protomer-specific dynamics similar to the corresponding homotrimers in antigenically important regions. The Omicron-G614 heterotrimer, co-assembling from protomers of divergent fusion subunit sequences, likewise showed overall similar dynamics and conformations in the receptor-binding subunit compared to the homotrimers. However, the incorporation of the Wuhan-Hu-1 G614 protomer led to a stabilizing effect on the relatively unstable Omicron fusion subunit in the heterotrimer. These findings reveal structural dynamic crosstalk in mosaic trimers, suggesting a potential for enhanced immunogen display and important considerations to be aware of in the use of polyvalent nucleic acid vaccines.

Author summaryHere we investigated the possibility of immunogen co-assembly from bivalent nucleic acid vaccines with a focus on probing potential impacts on antigen stability and epitope display. We purified mosaic heterotrimers composed of Omicron BA.2 and Wuhan-Hu-1 G614 protomers as well as those composed of Omicron BA.2 and XBB protomers. Both mosaic heterotrimers maintained their structural integrity, morphology, and N-glycosylation profiles. Using hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry, we demonstrated that both types of heterotrimers preserved strain-specific dynamics in critical antigenic regions, comparable to their homotrimer counterparts. Crosstalk between fusion subunits of Omicron BA.2 and Wuhan-Hu-1 G614 revealed a stabilizing effect of the G614 protomer on the inherently less stable fusion subunit in Omicron. Our findings provide insight into the structural dynamic profiles of co-expressed immunogen display, highlighting important considerations for polyvalent formulations that are being pursued to provide broad protection against highly variable pathogens."
"This study investigates the critical role of the dimeric GrpE protein as a thermosensor within bacterial DnaK complexes, with a specific focus on All4144, a GrpE homolog found in Anabaena sp. PCC7120. In the present work, we characterized All4144, which possesses both the GrpE domain and a helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain. Our aim was to elucidate the functional significance of the HTH domain by selectively deleting the region encompassing residues 1-67 from the full-length All4144. Our findings reveal that both All4144 and its deletion mutant function as homo-dimeric nucleotide exchange factors for DnaK, enhancing the ATPase and refolding activities of DnaK. Additionally, All4144 plays a role in DNA binding. On the contrary, the deletion mutant lacking the HTH motif exhibits impaired DNA-binding ability, underscoring the importance of the HTH domain. Moreover, All4144 superior cell survival and thermal stability profiles, compared to the deletion mutant. Taken together, our study sheds light on the multifunctional nature of All4144, highlighting its pivotal role in modulating thermal tolerance through interactions with DnaK and DNA.

"Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has become a prominent tool for studying human biology and disease. The availability of massive scRNA-seq datasets and advanced machine learning techniques has recently driven the development of single-cell foundation models that provide informative and versatile cell representations based on expression profiles. However, to understand disease states, we need to consider entire tissue ecosystems, simultaneously considering many different interacting cells. Here, we tackle this challenge by generating patient-level representations derived from multi-cellular expression context measured with scRNA-seq of tissues. We develop PaSCient, a novel model that employs a multi-level representation learning paradigm and provides importance scores at the individual cell and gene levels for fine-grained analysis across multiple cell types and gene programs characteristic of a given disease. We apply PaSCient to learn a disease model across a large-scale scRNA-seq atlas of 24.3 million cells from over 5,000 patients. Comprehensive and rigorous benchmarking demonstrates the superiority of PaSCient in disease classification and its multiple downstream applications, including dimensionality reduction, gene/cell type prioritization, and patient subgroup discovery."
"We construct a mathematical model of cancer dynamics with chemotherapeutic treatment, in the presence of bacteria that are capable of metabolizing the chemotherapeutic drug, hence sabotaging the treatment. We investigate the possibility of complementing the cancer treatment with antibiotic drugs, thus eradicating the bacteria or at least mitigating their negative impact on the prospects of therapy. Our model is a nonlinear system of four differential equations, for which we perform a complete analysis, explicitly characterizing the four possible outcomes, depending on whether the cancer cells or the bacteria extinct or persist. Global stability results are proven by the iterative application of a comparison principle, and a bifurcation diagram is created to show the transitions between scenarios with respect to the controllable parameters. We apply our model to an experiment on mice with colon cancer and the drug Gemcitabine."
"By shaping the inclusive fitness effects of behaviours, kinship environments have important implications for social evolution, and studies across non-human animal societies have shown that the patterns of kinship dynamics individuals experience as they age can be predicted by simple demographic parameters relating to sex-specific dispersal patterns, the extent of extra-group mating, and the age-specific patterns of mortality and fertility. However, it remains unclear whether these insights apply within our own species, where we see both extended lifespans in which kinship dynamics can play out, and remarkable variations in cultural practices relating to marriage and residence that influence the patterns of inter-individual relatedness. Here, using a newly developed model of kinship dynamics, we explore how marriage practices and post-marital residence rules, along with the typical survival and fertility schedules of our own species, can predict the emergent patterns of female and male kinship dynamics in human societies. By showing evidence that the model successfully captures the patterns of female and male kinship dynamics underlying human societies, we demonstrate that, despite the diversity in human social organisation, a relatively simple set of parameters relating to male and female rates of dispersal and the prevalence of extra-group mating suffices to capture the qualitative patterns of human kinship dynamics. Given the inclusive fitness implications kinship dynamics have for sex- and age-linked variations in behaviours, our study thus generates new insights into human social evolution."
"Cell signaling is modulated by the secretion of various proteins, which can be used to infer a cells phenotype. However, these proteins cannot be readily detected in multiplex by commonly used methods at the single-cell level. Here, we present a particles-in-particle (PiPs) concept comprising fluorescence intensity barcoded microparticles (BMPs) co-entrapped with a single cell inside an alginate hydrogel particle for multiplex protein secretion analysis (PiP-plex) and imaged by confocal microscopy. We developed a seven-plex fluorescent barcoding and concomitant sandwich immunoassay in PiPs with limits of detection ranging from 0.8 pg mL-1 to 2 ng mL-1 depending on the protein. PiP-plex assays were benchmarked with bulk immunoassays and found to rival or outperform them. We applied PiP-plex to analyze protein secreted by THP-1 cells upon exposure to lipopolysaccharide and detected varying cell responses, with a significant increase in MIP-1, TNF- and IL-17A. Multivariate analysis revealed that the majority of stimulated cells secreted either MIP-1 or IL-17A, while other cytokines were typically co-secreted. PiP-plex enables the analysis of [~]1000 cell h-1, while retaining >90 % cellular viability, showcasing its potential for characterizing cells and cell-based therapeutics for cancer immunotherapies."
"We investigated the roles of Rac guanine-nucleotide factor (Rac-GEF) Prex1 in glucose homeostasis using Prex1-/- and catalytically-inactive Prex1GD mice. Prex1 maintains fasting blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity through its Rac-GEF activity but limits glucose clearance independently of its catalytic activity, throughout ageing. Prex1-/-mice on high-fat diet are protected from developing diabetes. The increased glucose clearance in Prex1-/- mice stems from constitutively enhanced hepatic glucose uptake. Prex1 limits Glut2 surface levels, mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial ATP production, and controls mitochondrial morphology in hepatocytes, independently of its catalytic activity. Prex1 limits GPCR trafficking through an adaptor function, and we identify here the inhibitory orphan GPCR Gpr21 as a Prex1 target. The Gpr21-mediated blockade of glucose uptake and mitochondrial ATP production in hepatocytes requires Prex1. We propose that Prex1 limits glucose clearance by maintaining Gpr21 at the hepatocyte surface, thus limiting hepatic glucose uptake and metabolism.

"BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance is a major global health concern, with the environment playing a key role in its emergence and spread. Understanding the relationships between environmental factors, microbial communities, and resistance mechanisms is vital for elucidating environmental resistome dynamics. In this study, we characterized the environmental resistome of the Baltic Sea and evaluated how environmental gradients and spatial variability, alongside its microbial communities and associated functional genes, influence resistome diversity and composition across geographic regions.

ResultsWe analyzed the metagenomes of benthic sediments from 59 monitoring stations across a 1,150 km distance of the Baltic Sea, revealing an environmental resistome comprised of predicted antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) associated with resistance against 26 antibiotic classes. We observed spatial variation in its resistance profile, with higher resistome diversity in the northern regions and a decline in the dead zones and the southern areas. The combined effects of salinity and temperature gradients, alongside nutrient availability, created a complex environmental landscape that shaped the diversity and distribution of the predicted ARGs. Salinity predominantly influenced microbial communities and predicted ARG composition, leading to clear distinctions between high-saline regions and those with lower to mid-level salinity. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that microbial community composition and mobile genetic elements might be crucial in shaping ARG diversity and composition.

ConclusionsWe presented that salinity and temperature were identified as the primary environmental factors influencing resistome diversity and distribution across geographic regions, with nutrient availability further shaping these patterns in the Baltic Sea. Our study also highlighted the interplay between microbial communities, resistance, and associated functional genes in the benthic ecosystem, underscoring the potential role of microbial and mobile genetic element composition in ARG distribution. Understanding how environmental factors and microbial communities modulate environmental resistomes will help predict the impact of future environmental changes on resistance mechanisms in complex aquatic ecosystems."
"This systematic and meta-analytical review examined how a reduction in oxygen availability to tissue (hypoxia) affects cognitive function. Hypoxia had a moderate-to-large detrimental effect on general cognitive ability and across domains, including memory, attention, executive function, processing speed, and psychomotor speed. Increased hypoxic severity was associated with greater declines in general cognitive ability and executive function, while longer duration of exposure was associated with greater declines in executive function and psychomotor speed.

Participant age was a moderator for executive function and psychomotor speed, with older adults experiencing greater impairments. For executive function and psychomotor speed, the magnitude of these effects was less pronounced during intermittent and hypobaric exposures, potentially due to adaptive physiological mechanisms. While our models accounted for exposure characteristics and age of participants, substantial unexplained variance remained. These findings highlight hypoxias impact on cognition and emphasize the need to investigate underlying neurophysiological mechanisms that may influence individual vulnerability."
"FoxQ2 is a highly conserved class of Forkhead-box transcription factors expressed on the anterior side of the body in cnidarians and bilaterians. Despite this conserved expression pattern, recent phylogenetic analyses have revealed a complex and rapid evolution of this class, with several taxon-specific duplications and losses. Until recently, FoxQ2 was thought to be lost in most vertebrate lineages, and its presence and localization in different vertebrate groups remains unclear.

To reconcile these conflicting reports of conservation and divergence, here we present a comprehensive analysis of the phylogenetic relationships and expression patterns of FoxQ2 genes across metazoans. By combining phylogenetics and synteny analyses of FoxQ2 sequences from 21 animal phyla, we uncover the presence of three ancient FoxQ2 paralogs in bilaterians, which we name FoxQ2a, FoxQ2b and FoxQ2c. All three FoxQ2 paralogs are present in the chordate lineage and two are conserved in vertebrates, indicating a richer repertoire of vertebrate Fox genes than previously estimated.

To investigate the expression of FoxQ2 genes across bilaterians, we mined expression data from existing single cell transcriptomic datasets of mollusk, acoel, amphioxus and zebrafish development, and expanded it using fluorescent in situ hybridization in amphioxus, lamprey, skate, zebrafish and chicken. Our analysis demonstrates the conserved anterior expression of FoxQ2a and FoxQ2b paralogs while also revealing a novel domain of FoxQ2c expression within the chordate endoderm, including in amphioxus, lamprey and skate. Finally, we devise a method to predict conserved transcription factor binding sites across the three extant amphioxus genera with specificity to developmental stage and cell-type identity. This suggests conserved regulatory interactions for the expression of FoxQ2a across deuterostomes.

Overall, this work clarifies the complex evolutionary history of FoxQ2 genes and identifies a newly discovered endodermally-expressed Fox gene, FoxQ2c. We further propose that the early duplication of FoxQ2a and FoxQ2b, along with their redundant functions, provided the ideal background for subfunctionalization, contributing to the fast evolutionary rate of FoxQ2 sequences observed in bilaterians."
"Intracellular survival and replication within macrophages are key virulence determinants of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. This phenomenon is traditionally attributed to the activity of its two Type III Secretion Systems (T3SS) and their associated effectors. A critical challenge for these bacteria is acquiring nutrients from inside the host cell. Thus, they modulate the metabolism of host cells to replicate. Given the metabolic plasticity of macrophages, a key unresolved question is how their metabolic heterogeneity shapes intracellular Salmonella replication. By using human primary macrophages and live-cell imaging to monitor bacterial dynamics at the single-cell level, we revealed that Salmonella does not replicate in all infected cells. However, supplementation with specific carbon sources used by Salmonella during infection accelerated bacterial replication and increased the proportion of macrophages showing replicative bacteria. Remarkably, this occurred even in the absence of functional T3SSs, as a {Delta}prgH/{Delta}ssaV double mutant was able to replicate in a subset of infected cells under favorable nutrient conditions. These phenotypes are further amplified in macrophages with higher glycolytic activity, such as the murine RAW 264.7 cell line. Further analyses demonstrated that enhanced Salmonella replication is not strictly dependent on host glycolytic activity but is instead driven by the ability of the host cell to take up the nutrients Salmonella prefers for its replication early during infection. In summary, our findings suggest that the dependence of Salmonella on its T3SSs for intracellular replication can be bypassed when host cells provide optimal access to key nutrients and highlight the impact of metabolic heterogeneity in shaping intracellular bacterial replication during infection of macrophages."
"Random mutagenesis and deep mutational scanning (DMS) are widely used to optimize proteins by oversampling large libraries in microbial cells, selecting cells expressing favorable variants, and sequencing to identify enriched variants. However, these methods are slow and costly, require effort to establish selection methods for a given protein function, and do not yield data on lower-performing variants. Here, we describe Microbe-Independent Deep Assembly and Screening (MIDAS), a rapid, high-throughput method for optimizing protein function directly in mammalian cells. As a demonstration, we applied MIDAS to improve a newly designed neurotransmitter bioluminescent indicator (NeuBI) for acetylcholine (ACh). MIDAS systematically optimized interdomain linkers, identified mutational hotspots, and exhaustively scanned amino acid combinations, in each case relating specific sequences to protein performance. MIDAS-optimized variants exhibited improved performance in vivo, highlighting the potential of MIDAS for improving protein function in mammalian systems."
"Cannabinoid Receptor 2 (CB2) is a promising therapeutic target for modulating inflammation. Canonical signalling responses to receptor ligands are critically dependent on cell surface receptor expression. However, it is also now appreciated that intracellular G protein-coupled receptors can contribute to signalling responses and influence functional outcomes. Therefore, understanding how the subcellular distribution of receptors is controlled is also highly pertinent. CB2 is observed to be expressed at the cell surface as well as having a considerable proportion expressed intracellularly. Despite this distribution being well established, little is known about the regulation of CB2 anterograde trafficking and subcellular distribution. We report that sustained stimulation with a range of CB2 agonists concurrently internalises cell surface human CB2 and stimulates a distinct population of CB2 to be delivered to the cell surface, at various expression levels. We present evidence that the ligand-stimulated anterograde trafficking is a result of CB2 agonists, as well as inverse agonists, acting as pharmacological chaperones. We also report that a di-lysine (KK) motif in the CB2 C-terminal tail is required for basal delivery to the cell surface. Corroborating the hypothesis that CB2 ligands can act as pharmacological chaperones, sustained CB2 ligand stimulation induces cell surface expression of the mutated receptor and alters maturation states as measured by western blotting. Our finding that prolonged exposure to CB2 ligands can induce CB2 cell surface delivery via pharmacological chaperoning may well have important implications for optimal design of CB2-targeted therapeutics."
"IntroductionThe aging lung enters into a state of irreversible cellular growth arrest characterized by senescence. While senescence is beneficial in preventing oncogenic cell proliferation, it becomes detrimental when persistent, promoting chronic inflammation and fibrosis through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Such senescence-related pathophysiological processes play key roles in lung diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, few models accurately represent senescence in the human lung.

MethodsTo generate a human lung senescence in vitro model, we first generated a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived lung organoid (LO) system which was dissociated into monolayers and air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures to enhance visualization and allow uniform exposure to agents. Cellular senescence was induced using doxorubicin, a DNA-damaging agent. Senescence markers, such as {beta}-galactosidase ({beta}-gal) activity, SASP cytokine production and secretion, cell morphology, proliferative capacity, and barrier integrity were evaluated to validate the senescent phenotype.

ResultsThe doxorubicin-induced senescent hiPSC-derived lung cells demonstrated the hallmark characteristics of cellular senescence, including increased {beta}-gal activity and increased production of the pro-inflammatory SASP cytokine IL-6 and increased secretion of TNF-. Senescent cells displayed enlarged morphology, decreased proliferation, and reduced wound repair capacity. Barrier integrity was impaired with decreased electrical resistance, and increased permeability, as well as expression of abnormal tight junction proteins and increased fibrosis, all consistent with the senescent lung.

ConclusionOur hiPSC-derived lung cell senescent model reproduces key aspects of human lung senescence and offer an in vitro tool for studying age-related lung disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions. This model has potential applications in exploring the impact of environmental factors (e.g., toxins, infectious pathogens, etc.) on the senescent lung and assessing treatments that could mitigate pathologies associated with pulmonary aging including barrier impairment, inflammation and fibrosis."
"There are two meiotic cohesin pathways that regulate synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly in Drosophila. We previously proposed that C(2)M, which is required for SC assembly, is the only meiosis-specific component of a complex that includes Stromalin (SA), Nipped-B, SMC1 and SMC3. This model also predicts that specific residues within the C-terminus and N-terminus of C(2)M should interact with SMC1 and SMC3 to form a ring structure that may regulate the ability of C(2)M to facilitate SC assembly. Through mutant analysis, our results show several residues known to interact with SMC1 or SMC3 are critical for SC formation, suggesting that C(2)M may require a ring structure to perform meiosis-specific functions such as the formation of SC. We also show that SA colocalizes with and depends on C(2)M. However, the dynamics of C(2)M differ from SA and the SMCs in a way that suggests C(2)M regulates the dynamics and chromosome loading of the other cohesin proteins SMC1 and SA. Consistent with this conclusion, our results suggest that C(2)M can promote chromosome localization of the other cohesin components, and can induce SC assembly when ectopically expressed in germline mitotic cells."
"Voltage-gated, potassium-selective KV7.4 channels are expressed in the inner ear and are crucial for hair-cell function and survival. Loss-of-function variants of KCNQ4, the gene encoding KV7.4-channel subunits, cause non-syndromic progressive hearing loss (DFNA2). KV7.4 opening requires a voltage-dependent conformational change (activation) of the charged voltage-sensor domains (VSDs), and its transduction to the pore. Previously, fast charge displacement was reported during VSD activation at negative potentials, but it is unclear how this is coupled to slow channel opening occurring at more depolarized potentials. Here, we optically tracked KV7.4 VSD activation with voltage-clamp fluorometry, leveraging two different fluorophores and pulsed excitation, to thoroughly characterize VSD movements. We found that VSD activation comprises several voltage-dependent transitions, some of which had kinetics and voltage-dependence matching those of channel opening and closing. The deafness-associated mutation R216H, which substitutes a charged amino-acid in the VSD, impaired both VSD movements and channel opening, shifting them towards more depolarized potentials. This suggested that R216H impaired KV7.4 function by destabilizing VSD activation. Using molecular dynamics, we found that H216 reduced intramolecular interactions, thus decreasing the stability of an active VSD conformation. We propose that the KV7.4 VSD activates in two steps: a fast movement at negative voltages that represents a first transition to an intermediate state of activation; and this is followed by slower, depolarized component that represents subsequent full VSD activation, which drives channel opening."
"As habitat destruction intensifies due to expanding human infrastructure, balancing biodiversity conservation with resource extraction has become a global challenge. Thus, quantifying the extent and location of proposed mining operations is key to mitigating the impacts on threatened species. This issue is particularly acute in the biodiversity hotspots of southeast Asia, where rapid economic growth needs to be balanced with sustainable conservation management of the remaining tropical forest. The Philippine Eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi), a critically endangered tropical forest raptor endemic to the Philippines, faces increasing threats from mining activities that destroy and fragment its tropical forest habitat. Here, we integrate Species Distribution Modelling with gap and hotspot analysis to assess the spatial overlap between Philippine Eagle nest habitat and mining concessions across a protected area network on Mindanao, where the largest population remains. Using a landscape-scale SDM built with remote sensing covariates and eagle occurrence data, we identified high-suitability nest habitats and projected these into the Eastern Mindanao Biodiversity Corridor (EMBC). Hotspot analysis revealed that 41 % of the total mining concessions area contained high-suitability nest habitat, highlighting significant conservation risks. Additionally, 46 % of indigenous ancestral domains contain high-suitability nest habitat, emphasizing the importance of indigenous land management in safeguarding eagle habitats. Our gap analysis demonstrated that 35 % of the EMBC protects high-suitability nest habitat, which here represents the remaining montane tropical forest. To mitigate mining impacts, we propose targeted nest surveys in high-risk areas, implementation of mining moratoriums near critical nesting zones, and strengthening indigenous and protected area land management. By integrating SDMs with spatial analysis, we provide a framework for directing conservation efforts to balance resource extraction with the preservation of the Philippine Eagles habitat. Our findings offer crucial insights for policy development and land-use planning to protect this iconic species and its threatened habitat."
"Many functions of the nuclear envelope protein LBR (Lamin B Receptor) have been documented. LBR influences the shape of the nuclear envelope via its connections to underlying heterochromatin and to the lamina. LBR also functions as an essential enzyme in sterol biosynthesis. This study attempts to further define the LBR gene functions in a LBR knockdown cell line (HL-60/sh1), by employing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to explore: Part 1) the effects of LBR knockdown on cell differentiation to granulocytes induced by retinoic acid (RA); Part 2) the effects of LBR knockdown on phenotypic differences between undifferentiated HL-60/sh1 and undifferentiated control cell lines (HL-60/S4 and HL-60/gfp). These GSEA studies are based upon previously published mRNA transcriptome data. In Part 1, the most significant effects were the increased loss of heterochromatin and the decreased histone methyltransferase activity in RA-differentiated HL-60/sh1 granulocytes, compared to HL-60/S4 and HL-60/gfp granulocytes. In addition, HL-60/sh1 ribosome structural protein transcripts were more increased during granulocyte differentiation, than observed in HL-60/S4 and HL-60/gfp. For many predicted phenotypes (e.g., senescence, migration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis and apoptosis), no significant differences were observed among the three granulocytic cell lines. In Part 2, comparisons were mainly between undifferentiated HL-60/sh1 and HL-60/S4 cells. We noted a significant increase in ribosomal protein and ribosomal RNA synthesis in sh1 0 versus to S4 0 cells. Of further interest, we observed that the position and number of nucleoli per cell appeared to differ between these two undifferentiated cell lines. In addition, GSEA results indicated a significant gain in heterochromatin and nucleosome formation in sh1 0 versus S4 0 cells. Microscopic imaging of undifferentiated sh1 0 cells compared to S4 0 cells indicated increased DAPI stained chromatin condensates surrounding the frequently central nucleoli, possibly reflecting the increased heterochromatin and the decreased LBR. Furthermore, the sh1 0 cell nuclei appeared ""rounder"" than the S4 0 cell nuclei. Evidence is presented supporting that the LINC Complex (""Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton"") may play a role."
"Since the 1950s, radiocarbon measurements have anchored archaeological chronologies dating back to 50,000 years, with bone collagen being a commonly dated material. Despite advances in collagen extraction protocols, the process remains destructive, requiring sampling by sawing, drilling or crushing of dry bone, that can damage or destroy physical features and archaeological evidence, and often consumes the entire specimen. While non-destructive approaches have recently been applied in ancient genomics and palaeoproteomics, no equivalent approach has been established for radiocarbon dating of bone. Here, we outline a non-destructive collagen extraction workflow that avoids invasive sampling (cutting or drilling) and produces no visible damage to the bone. By heating the bone in hot water for several hours, collagen is solubilized, and the resulting collagenous solution can be purified and AMS dated. Here we show that the amino acid composition, C/N atomic ratios, {delta}13C and {delta}15N values of the hot-water-extracted collagen are comparable to collagen isolated from the same bones using classic decalcification methodologies. The hot water extraction method was tested on various bones, ranging from the Bronze Age to the Middle and Upper Paleolithic periods, which had been dated previously using routine destructive methods that involved acid demineralization. Our results show that non-destructive collagen extraction, coupled with an additional purification step e.g., ultrafiltration, yields identical radiocarbon ages to those obtained via the routine destructive methods."
"BackgroundThe rumen harbors a diverse and dynamic microbiome vital in digesting vegetation into metabolic byproducts for energy and general biological function. Although previous studies have reported connections between the rumen and the overall health of the sheep, the exact biological process by which this occurs is not well understood. Therefore, our study aimed to quantify sheep rumen metabolites to determine if enriched biological pathways are differentiable across phenotypic features of sex, age, and weight.

ResultsWe collected and quantified metabolites of rumen samples from sixteen sheep using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We performed a series of univariate and multivariate statistical analyses to interpret the rumen metabolomics data. To identify metabolic pathways associated with the phenotypic features of sex, weight, and age, we used MetaboAnalyst, which identified amino acid metabolism as a distinguishing factor. Among the pathways, phenylalanine metabolism emerged as a key pathway differentiating sheep based on sex and age. Additionally, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis were exclusively associated with age. In univariate linear models, we also discovered that these amino acid and protein pathways were associated with weight by age-corrected effect. Finally, we identified arginine and proline biosynthesis as a pathway linked to metabolites with weight.

ConclusionOur study identified differential pathways based on the sex, age, and weight features of sheep. Metabolites produced by the rumen may act as an indicator for sheep health and other ruminants. These findings encourage further investigation of the differentially produced metabolites to assess overall sheep health."
"Cellular protein concentrations are controlled by rates of synthesis and clearance, the lat-ter including protein degradation and dilution due to growth. Thus, cell growth rate may influence the mechanisms controlling variation in protein concentrations. To quantify this influence, we analyzed the growth-dependent effects of protein degradation within a cell type (between activated and resting human B-cells), across human cell types and mouse tissues. This analysis benefited from deep and accurate quantification of over 12,000 proteins across four primary tissues using plexDIA. The results indicate that growth-dependent dilution can account for 40 % of protein concentration changes across conditions. Furthermore, we find that the variation in protein degradation rates is sufficient to account for up to 50 % of the variation in concentrations within slowly growing cells as contrasted with 7 % in growing cells. Remarkably, degradation rates differ significantly between proteoforms encoded by the same gene and arising from alternative splicing or alternate RNA decoding. These proteoform-specific degradation rates substantially determine the proteoform abundance, especially in the brain. Thus, our model and data unify previous observations with our new results and demonstrate substantially larger than previously appreciated contributions of protein degradation to protein variation at slow growth, both across proteoforms and tissue types."
"Legionella pneumophila is an environmental Gram-negative bacterium that parasitizes unicellular protozoa and can cause severe pulmonary infections when aerosolized bacteria are inhaled by humans. One critical aspect of Legionella pathogenesis is the establishment in the cytosol of infected macrophages of a unique ER-derived vacuole, that requires a sustained supply of host lipids during expansion. Subversion of pro-lipogenic pathways downstream of the metabolic checkpoint kinase mTOR (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) are critical for niche expansion. In eukaryotic cells, amino acids sufficiency and growth factor sensory signals converge on mTOR to ensure metabolic processes are coupled to nutrients/energy availability. Legionella can trigger mTOR signaling in infected cells by increasing the intracellular abundance of amino acids through inhibition of host translation. Here, we describe a novel mechanism by which Legionella sensitizes mTOR in infected macrophages. A forward genetic screen identified Lpg0393 protein as a putative bacterial mTOR regulator that contains a VPS9-domain typically found in eukaryotic GEFs (Guanine nucleotide exchange factors) for Rab5 GTPase family members (Rab5/Rab21/Rab22). We uncovered that Lpg0393 lowers the activation threshold for mTOR signaling upon stimulation with arginine or leucine through rewiring of processes upstream of mTOR by removing Rab5-dependency and replacing it with a Rab21/Rab22-dependency. Data from cells expressing either a bacterial or a eukaryotic mTOR sensitizing factor uncovered two distinct intraorganellar Arg/Leu pools that fuel mTOR activation in parallel - one regulated by Rab21/22 and the other by Rab5. Consistent with the role of mTOR in expansion of the Legionella-occupied organelle, deletion of Lpg0393 also resulted in premature vacuolar rupture in a mTOR-dependent manner. All together, we have identified a novel bacterial mTOR regulator and consistent with its reported functions we propose Lpg0393 is named as BinA (Bacterial initiator of TORC1 signaling and an activator of Rab5 family GTPases).

Author SummaryLegionella pneumophila - a prototypical vacuolar pathogen - manipulates host lipogenesis to sustain membrane biogenesis, which ensures the integrity of the vacuolar compartment is not compromised as demand for housing capacity increases during bacterial replication. Subversion of the host mTOR kinase signaling, which functions as a central regulatory hub coordinating nutrients sufficiency with metabolic output, is one mechanism by which Legionella increases de novo lipogenesis in infected cells. Here, we report a novel mechanism by which the bacteria sustain mTOR signaling through the actions of the type IV secretion system effector BinA. We found that BinA rewires amino acid transport mechanisms by manipulating Rab5 family GTPase to selectively sensitize mTOR to arginine and leucine but not methionine or glutamine stimulation. mTOR sensitization by BinA revealed a switch in upstream regulators from Rab5 to Rab21/Rab22. Our work provides novel insight into how pathogens exert metabolic control over host cells to maximize intracellular replication."
"Spatial transcriptomics provides insights into tissue architecture by linking gene expression with spatial localization. Current deconvolution methods rely heavily on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) references, which are costly and often unavailable, mainly if the tissue under evaluation is limited, such as in a core biopsy specimen. We present a novel tool, CITEgeist, that deconvolutes spatial transcriptomics data using antibody capture from the same slide as the reference, directly leveraging cell surface protein measurements from the same tissue section. This approach circumvents the limitations of scRNA-seq as a reference, offering a cost-effective and biologically grounded alternative. Our method employs mathematical optimization to estimate cell type proportions and gene expression profiles, incorporating sparsity constraints for robustness and interpretability. Benchmarks against state-of-the-art deconvolution methods show improved accuracy in cell type resolution, particularly in dense tumor microenvironments, while maintaining computational efficiency. This antibody-based tool advances spatial transcriptomics by providing a scalable, accurate, and reference-independent solution for deconvolution in complex tissues. We validate this tool by using a combined approach of simulated data and clinical samples by applying CITEgeist to translational pre-treatment and post-treatment ER+ breast tumors from an ongoing clinical trial, emphasizing the applicability and robustness of CITEgeist."
"The binding of sequence-specific TFs (TF) to genomic DNA is fundamental to gene regulation. Emerging single-molecule footprinting (SMF) technologies such as the NOMe-seq and Fiber-seq assays offer unique opportunities for acquiring quantitative information about binding states of TFs and nucleosomes at single-DNA-molecule resolution. Contrasting bulk epigenomic profiling methodologies, SMF enables better molecular characterization of inherently stochastic processes of protein-DNA interactions. Despite the many advantages that SMF technologies bring for studying mechanisms of gene regulation, rigorous statistical models for the analysis of datasets generated using these technologies are still missing. Here, we introduce a novel statistical framework designed for inference of footprint lengths and predictions of footprint positions for unbiased quantitative analysis and interpretation of SMF datasets. We carried out comprehensive computational simulations of SMF experiments and identified experimental parameters that are critical to footprint detection. Finally, we demonstrate the power of this statistical approach for the analysis of genome-wide and amplicon-based NOMe-seq datasets generated for mouse embryonic stem cells."

This research underscores the importance of multidisciplinary approaches for advancing 21st-century scientific literacy and emphasizes the global adaptability of such innovative programs."
"Recent work suggests an altered duodenal mucosa-associated microbiota (MAM) in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD) when compared to outpatient controls, these differences may reflect alterations in host-microbiome homeostasis. Given that specific mucosal immune signatures have been identified in FD, we hypothesised that these changes would be associated with specific microbial changes. We aimed to profile the duodenal MAM to identify microbes associated with known changes in FD mucosal and peripheral immune homeostasis. Duodenal biopsies were collected from 11 asymptomatic outpatient controls and 17 FD patients. Separate biopsies were collected for MAM 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, histological evaluation, and mucosal lamina propria mononuclear cell (LPMC) isolation. Where available peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from whole blood. PBMC and LPMC populations were analysed for CD4 and CD8 T cell populations by flow cytometry. Initial comparisons of histological and immune measures revealed significant differences between FD and outpatient controls, with decreased villi goblet cells and increased LPMC CD4 Central Memory, LPMC CD8, and PBMC CD4+ Central Memory Th17 in FD compared to controls. While microbiome profiles varied between groups, specific associations with the histological and immunological scoring found that in controls, villi goblet cells correlated positively with Massilia and negatively with Exiguobacterium, while FD patients showed no significant correlations. Additionally, controls exhibited a negative correlation between LPMC CD4 Central Memory and Veillonella, with FD patients showing no significant correlation. Notably, FD patients demonstrated a significant negative correlation between LPMC CD8 and Sulfophobococcus, and a positive correlation between PBMC CD4+ Central Memory Th17 and both Gemella and Fusobacterium.

ImportanceWhile several papers have reported the alteration in FD duodenal MAM, study numbers are low and consensus on specific biomarker signatures within the microbiome have not been reached. Our findings contribute to this growing body of evidence, indicating that patients with FD exhibit distinct alterations in duodenal MAM and immune profiles compared to outpatient controls. Furthermore, the immune-microbiome associations present in control populations were absent in FD patients suggesting a loss of host-microbiome homeostasis that may contribute to FD pathophysiology. Our work highlights potential microbial biomarkers which may be a consequence or driver of the mucosal micro-inflammation state which is a characteristic of FD. Future work is required to validate whether these specific microbes are responsible for driving inappropriate host immune responses to inform treatment strategies and assist with disorder diagnosis."
"Mongolian cattle is an excellent local breed with strong reproductive ability in Inner Mongolia of China. Spermatogenesis is a comprehensive process to decide the reproductive ability. In order to understand the cellular and molecular mechanism of spermatogenesis of Mongolian cattle, scRNA-seq was used to describe the heterogeneity of cells and gene expression profile in testis. The results showed 8 cell clusters. Among somatic cells, Sertoli cells were obviously more in young cattle than that in adult cattle, moreover, there were 4 subpopulations of Sertoli cells (SC1[~]4). In the matured Sertoli cells (SC4), up-regulated genes were mainly enriched in immune system activity, enhancing immune response, and regulating cellular processes. The top 5 marker genes (BTG2, FOSB, EGR1, JUNB, CCNL1) were highly expressed in the testes of Mongolian cattle and water buffalo compared to Holstein cattle, which were highly expressed in the developing SC1. Gain/loss-of-function of EGR1 in Sertoli cells isolated from Mongolian cattle testes positively regulated the expression of FOS and JUN. The results indicated that SC1 acted as the foundation and SC4 as the matured supportive cells and EGR1 would promote the spermatogenesis by regulating AP-1 transcription factor member FOS and JUNto maintain strong reproductive capacity of Mongolian cattle."
"Landscape structure may facilitate or inhibit the dispersal of species by presenting barriers or opportunities. Slow dispersing edge specialists are likely to be most affected by local topography and land management practices because they require two different adjacent habitats within their limited dispersal range. The northern hairy wood ant, Formica lugubris, requires adjacent forest and open habitats to access aphid honeydew, invertebrate prey, and direct sunlight for thermoregulation. In plantation forest, canopy gaps that provide this combination are often linear and anthropogenic, such as paths, firebreaks, and roads (collectively termed  rides), and their orientation determines shade distribution. Using population data spanning 10 years, we ask how properties of rides, such as bearing and width, affect the distribution and dispersal of wood ant populations in the North York Moors. Regardless of orientation, nests were more abundant on the north side of rides, where they receive more sunlight, and nests were generally larger on narrower rides. Furthermore, we found that F. lugubris dispersed approximately 3 times quicker along rides that were oriented north-south or east-west compared to NE-SW or NW-SE. Because wood ants can suppress defoliating pests, these findings have potential forest management implications and may apply to other forest dwelling edge specialists."
"Recent developments in DNA synthesis and sequencing have allowed the construction of comprehensive gene variant libraries and their functional analysis. Achieving high-replication and thorough mutation characterization remains technically and financially challenging for long genes. Here, we developed an efficient, affordable and scalable library construction approach that relies on low-cost DNA synthesis and standard cloning technologies, which will increase accessibility to systematic mutational studies and help advance the field of protein science."
"The Threespine Stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, is an emerging model system for understanding the genomic basis of vertebrate adaptation. A strength of the system is that marine populations have repeatedly colonized freshwater environments, serving as natural biological replicates. These replicates have enabled researchers to efficiently identify phenotypes and genotypes under selection during this transition. While this repeated adaptation to freshwater has occurred throughout the northern hemisphere, the Cook Inlet in south-central Alaska has been an area of focus. The freshwater lakes in this area are being studied extensively and there is a high-quality freshwater reference assembly from a population in the region, Bear Paw Lake. Using a freshwater reference assembly is a potential limitation because genomic segments are repeatedly lost during freshwater adaptation. This scenario results in some of the key regions associated with marine-freshwater divergence being absent from freshwater genomes, and therefore absent from the reference assemblies. It may also be that isolated freshwater populations are more genetically diverged, potentially increasing reference biases. Here we present a highly-continuous marine assembly from Rabbit Slough in the Cook Inlet. All contigs are from long-read sequencing and have been ordered and oriented with Hi-C. The contigs are anchored to chromosomes and form a 454 Mbp assembly with an N50 of 1.3 Mbp, an L50 of 95, and a BUSCO score over 97%. The organization of the chromosomes in this marine individual is similar to existing freshwater assemblies, but with important structural differences, including the 3 previously known inversions that repeatedly separate marine and freshwater ecotypes. We anticipate that this high-quality marine assembly will more accurately reflect the ancestral population that founded the freshwater lakes in the area and will more closely match most other populations from around the world. This marine assembly, which includes the repeatedly deleted segments and offers a closer reference sequence for most populations, will enable more comprehensive and accurate computational and functional genomic investigations of Threespine Stickleback evolution."
"O_LIIntraspecific variation between crop wild relatives (CWRs) represents a source of untapped genetic diversity for crop improvement. At the same time, improving photosynthesis in crops has the potential to enhance yield. Thus, exploring variation for photophysiology within CWRs is an important, yet underexplored, research area.
C_LIO_LIWe describe a common garden experiment where 320 wild barley accessions were grown across two seasons. A photophysiology phenotyping pipeline was employed to quantify >30 traits within this diversity panel. Population genetics, genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) and deep phenotyping were performed to address local adaptation hypotheses.
C_LIO_LIHeritable variation was detected across this photophysiological spectrum, with genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions being prevalent. Evidence for local adaptation was observed in the form of subpopulation differences, signals of selection, and allele frequency variation associated to markers identified via GWAS. Phenotyping of representative accessions across distinct water availabilities highlighted a role for stomatal conductance (gs) in adaptation to dry environments.
C_LIO_LIWe identified substantial variation in key photosynthesis-associated traits in a CWR closely related to barley, an economically important crop species. Our results demonstrate that this variation is partially due to local adaptation, where plasticity in gs appears important for maintaining photosynthesis and biomass accumulation in water restricted conditions.

"Entamoeba is the amoebozoan parasite commonly found in the intestines of animals. E. marina is the first exception isolated from marine sediments, possibly adapting from animal intestines to the sea. However, the evolutionary process of E. marina remains uncertain due to the lack of a genome sequence. Here, we present the de novo genome and transcriptome of E. marina using Oxford Nanopore MinION and Illumina HiSeq/MiSeq. The genome of E. marina is approximately 37.5 Mbp in length and consisted of 202 contigs, which is the second longest followed by E. invadens. E. marina showed significant reduction in the major virulence-associated gene families, including cysteine proteases, lysosomal enzyme transporters, and surface galactose/N-acetylglucosamine-specific lectins, suggesting diversification, more specifically reduction of pathogenicity-related genes. Genome and RNA-seq analyses also indicated genes either conserved throughout eukaryotes or laterally transferred from prokaryotes, and potentially responsible for salt tolerance. Our study provides insights into the mechanism underlying the lifestyle changes in the evolution of parasitic eukaryotes."
"Improvements in single-cell sequencing have enabled phenotyping at organism-scale and molecular resolution, but interpreting such experiments poses computational challenges. Identifying the genes and cell types directly impacted by genetic, chemical, or environmental perturbations requires explicit modeling of lineage relationships amongst many cell types, over time, from datasets with millions of cells collected from thousands of specimens. We describe two software tools, ""Hooke"" and ""Platt"", which exploit the rich statistical patterns within single-cell datasets to characterize the direct molecular and cellular consequences of experimental perturbations. We apply Hooke and Platt to a single-cell atlas of thousands of perturbed zebrafish embryos to synthesize a coherent map of lineage dependencies and leverage it to reveal previously unappreciated roles for fate-determining transcription factors. We show that cell type covariation in single-cell datasets is a powerful source of information for inferring how cells depend on genes and one another in the program of vertebrate development."
"Online vision testing enables efficient data collection from diverse participants but often requires accurate fixation. When needed, fixation accuracy is traditionally ensured by using a camera to track gaze. That works well in the lab, but tracking during online testing with a built-in webcam is not yet sufficiently precise. Kurzawski, Pombo, et al. (2023) introduced a fixation task that improves fixation through hand-eye coordination, requiring participants to track a moving crosshair with a mouse-controlled cursor. This dynamic fixation task greatly reduces peeking at peripheral targets relative to a stationary fixation task, but does not eliminate it. Here, we introduce a crowded dynamic fixation task that further enhances fixation by adding clutter around the fixation mark to leverage crowding. We assessed fixation accuracy during peripheral threshold measurement. Relative to the RMS gaze error during the stationary fixation task, dynamic fixation error was 61%, while crowded dynamic fixation error was only 47%. With a 1.5{degrees} tolerance, peeking occurred on 9% of trials with stationary fixation, 4% with dynamic fixation, and 0% with crowded dynamic fixation. This improvement eliminated implausibly low peripheral thresholds, likely by preventing peeking. We conclude that crowded dynamic fixation provides accurate gaze control for online testing."
"The coordination of actin-binding proteins (ABPs) is essential for forming a wide range of actin structures that drive vital cellular processes. Many of the ABPs, like the severing protein cofilins, exhibit affinities dependent on the nucleotide state of actin monomers. Experiments have shown that cofilins interact with actin filaments cooperatively in a concentration-dependent manner, where it severs less at both low and high concentrations. However, how this nucleotide state-dependent severing influences actin filament distributions is poorly understood. Here, we propose a computational model of actin filament dynamics that combines stochastic polymerization, phosphate release, hydrolysis-dependent cooperative binding of cofilins, and severing of actin monomers. This model simultaneously reproduces key experimentally observed features: The non-monotonic change of the filament length and the monotonic decay in actin cap size with the increasing cofilin concentration, as well as the linear increase of the cap size with the actin concentration. We elucidate how both these emerge from the tuning of the heterogeneity in the arrangement of cofilin decorated and undecorated monomers within a filament. We also predict that, with varying cofilin concentrations, steady-state length distributions can change from symmetric bell-shaped to long-tailed skewe d shapes. We show that, in some regimes, our model simplifies to a coarse-grained model enabling us to mathematically predict that the distribution of undecorated monomers is exponential with a decay exponent that depends on cofilin and actin concentration. This study highlights the importance of non equilibrium processes that can modulate structural heterogeneity within a filament to shape actin length variation."
"Transcription initiation is a critical regulatory step in plant gene expression, yet its sequence determinants remain largely elusive. Here we introduce GenoRetriever, an interpretable deep learning model that deciphers the sequence basis of transcriptional initiation regulation across plant genomes. Trained on STRIPE-seq data from 16 soybean tissues and six other crop species, GenoRetriever identifies 27 core sequence motifs that govern transcription start site (TSS) selection and usage. The model predicts TSS locations and usage levels with high accuracy, as validated by in silico motif insertions, saturation mutagenesis, and CRISPR-Cas9 promoter editing. It further reveals that 31.85% of natural variation between wild and domesticated soybean drives shifts in promoter motif usage during domestication, and uncovers lineage-specific motif effects between monocots and dicots. This interpretable model and its user-friendly web server for promoter analysis and design make GenoRetriever both a methodological innovation and practical tool for plant functional genomics and crop improvement."
"The proliferation of wearable sensors provides large-scale longitudinal physiological data collected in real-world settings, offering unprecedented opportunities to investigate dynamic human responses to exercise interventions. However, systematically quantifying key physiological indicators related to adaptation and fatigue from these dense time-series data, particularly from popular platform APIs like Strava, and performing standardized, reproducible integrative analyses currently lacks established open-source workflows in R, posing significant practical and computational barriers. Researchers often expend considerable effort on custom programming, limiting analytical scale and efficiency. To overcome this critical bottleneck and empower broader research applications, we developed and introduce Athlytics, a computational framework specifically designed for processing Strava API data directly within R for longitudinal exercise physiology analysis. This framework provides a dedicated means to seamlessly integrate data acquisition with the calculation of key physiological indicators (such as ACWR reflecting training stress balance, EF assessing aerobic efficiency, and physiological decoupling indicating cardiovascular stability), based on activity summary data while carefully addressing necessary approximations for composite load metrics like TSS/HRSS, and multidimensional time-series visualization. By providing standardized function interfaces, Athlytics significantly lowers the technical barrier for conducting complex longitudinal analyses, enabling researchers to efficiently test hypotheses regarding the dynamic interplay between training stimuli, physiological efficiency, and stress responses. This work provides an open-source computational tool that fills a critical gap, contributing by substantially enhancing the feasibility, efficiency, and reproducibility of quantitative exercise physiology research utilizing widely available physiological sensor data through standardization and automation. The package (https://github.com/HzaCode/Athlytics) provides an important foundation for standardizing and applying computational methods in this field."
"Carbon neutrality needs to be implemented spatially in order to be realized concretely. The distribution of carbon sources and sinks across the national territory is closely related to many factors, such as natural geographical resources, levels of economic and social development, and cultural and historical heritage. It is difficult for many regions to achieve carbon neutrality through their own efforts alone. This article believes that only by achieving local optimal carbon neutrality through a reasonable spatial organization can emissions be ultimately reduced to zero on a national scale. Under the connection of rivers, the basin forms an ecosystem and an economic system with independent characteristics. Carbon sources and sinks within the basin exist within the ecological and economic space of the basin, forming a unique carbon neutrality spatial pattern. This study starts with the spatial distribution status, features and relationships of carbon neutrality elements in the cities of the Yangtze River Basin, and divides the cities into eight types based on their development level, emission level and forest resources, such as high-emission and low-carbon sink developed cities and low-emission and high-carbon sink underdeveloped cities. Different types of cities are proposed with carbon neutrality paths and spatial organization schemes, and it is suggested that the spatial organization demonstration of carbon neutrality in the cities of the Yangtze River Basin can provide a reference for carbon neutrality on a national scale."
"Language learning and use relies on both domain-specific and domain-general cognitive and sensory-motor functions. Evolutionary and developmental perspectives, as well as the use of language in interaction, suggest an overlap between language and other skills. Building on our previous behavioural findings, which outlined a consistent behavioural association between language and domain-general skills, we investigated brain-behavioural associations using story listening during fMRI and behavioural measures of language, reading, multilingual experience, cognition, musicality, arithmetic, and motor skills. Participants varied in multilingual language experience and reading aptitudes, including both typical (TRs) and dyslexic readers (DRs). Using multivariate Partial Least Squares correlation, we identified a main component linking cognitive, linguistic, and phonological measures to brain areas underlying lexico/semantics, combinatorial processing, and amodal semantic processing. A second analysis excluding DRs showed closer associations between cognitive/linguistic, literacy, phonological and memory processes within the same brain network as in the full sample. Here, we also isolated additional, complementary components, including one involving speed, automatization and lexical access, linked to auditory and motor brain areas. This suggests greater coherence and more integrated,  expert processing in TRs. This work is a first step in exploring complex relationships between language and non-linguistic functions that are important to it."
"Low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diets (KDs) are used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy, and other potential benefits for treating neurological disorders, metabolic syndrome, and cancer are being explored. In addition to these and other medical applications, KDs have also become popular for rapid weight-loss and enhancing athletic performance. However, the effects of exposing developing offspring to KDs during pregnancy (gestational KD) are poorly understood, and especially their long-term health consequences. In this study, we investigated the effects of a partial gestational KD during the second half of pregnancy in mice and assessed the consequences on the offspring over their entire lifespan compared to offspring exposed to a control diet. We found that a gestational KD significantly reduced dams litter size and litter mass and altered the sex ratio at birth, reducing the proportion of female offspring, which also had lower body mass early in their life. In contrast, male offspring exposed to a gestational KD suffered a significantly reduced lifespan and a late-onset increase in body mass. We found no evidence that our KD diet influenced adult offspring behavior (locomotion, anxiety, depression, circadian rhythms, food and water consumption) or reproduction. These findings highlight the potential of even a partial maternal exposure to a KD to have surprisingly detrimental effects on offspring health and longevity, and thus raising concerns about its use during pregnancy."
"During embryonic development, cells undergo differentiation into highly specialized cell types. Capitalizing on single-cell RNA sequencing, many initiatives and substantial resources have been established for cataloguing these differentiated cell types by their transcriptomic profiles. Despite the extensive efforts to profile various organs and their cellular compositions, we lack metrics to assess the completeness of the sequencing projects. In this cellular biodiversity analysis, we leveraged the increasingly available single-cell data together with statistical methods, originally developed for assessing the species richness of ecological communities, to estimate the cellular diversity of any organ based on current data from single-cell profiling technologies. Deriving from such cellular richness estimates, we established a practical statistical framework that enables reliable assessment of the completeness of any large-scale single-cell profiling projects, after which additional sequencing efforts do not anymore reveal new insights into an organs cellular composition. Such estimates can serve as stoppage-points for the ongoing sequencing projects, hence guiding a more cost-efficient completion of the profiling of various human tissues."
"Mesenchymal Stromal Cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) may retain the cancer targeting and immune privilege of MSCs. The immense potential MSC-EVs hold as tumour-targeted therapeutics warrants an understanding of potential adverse events to support clinical translation. This study aimed to determine whether MSC-EVs would elicit an immune response following administration in tumour-bearing immunocompetent animals. Secreted EVs were isolated from both human and murine bone marrow derived MSCs and characterized. hMSC-EVs or mMSC-EVs were administered intravenously into 4T1 breast tumour-bearing Balb/c mice or healthy controls. Tumour tissue, draining lymph nodes and spleens were harvested, dissociated into a single cell suspension and flow cytometry performed targeting T cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The 4T1 model immune profile was first determined by comparing the spleen of tumour-bearing animals to healthy controls. T cells were increased in tumour-bearing animals (CD4+/CD25+ p=0.041; CD8+/CD25+ p=0.02). A significant elevation of GR-1+ MDSCs (p=0.002), CD11b+ macrophages (p=0.023) and CD11c+ dendritic cells (p=0.001) was also observed. In contrast, CD27+ NK cells were significantly decreased compared to the spleen of healthy animals (p=0.006). Collectively this data validated the immune profile and supported the determination of any changes in response to hMSC-EVs or mMSC-EVs administration. No significant activation of CD4+ (p=0.20) or CD8+ (p=0.57) T cells were seen in tumour tissue in both groups. The percentage of GR-1+ MDSCs (28% vs 27%, p=0.92), CD11b+, CD11c+ and CD27+ cells were similar regardless of EV origin. No significant changes in T cells, MDSCs, macrophages, dendritic or NK cells were observed in the lymph node or spleen of animals that received hMSC-EV versus mMSC-EVs. In conclusion, human MSC-EVs elicited no discernible immune response in mice, supporting the hypothesis that MSC-EVs retain the immune privilege of the secretory cell. This reinforces the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs."
"During the regeneration of injured or lost tissues, the regeneration blastema serves as a hub for robust growth. Drosophila imaginal discs are a genetically tractable and simple model system for the study of regeneration and organization of this regrowth. Key signals that contribute to regenerative growth in these discs, such as ROS, Wnt/Wg, JNK, p38, JAK/STAT, and the Hippo pathway, have been identified. However, a detailed exploration of the spatial organization of regrowth, the factors that directly drive this growth, and the consequences of activating drivers of regeneration has not been undertaken. Here, we find that regenerative growth in imaginal discs is controlled by the transcription factor Myc and by Tor signaling, which additively drive proliferation and translation in the regeneration blastema. The spatial organization of growth in the blastema is arranged into concentric growth zones defined by Myc expression, elevated Tor activity, and elevated translation. In addition, the increased Myc expression in the innermost zone induced Xrp1-independent cell competition-like death in the adjacent zones, revealing a delicate balance between driving growth and inducing death in the regenerating tissue.

Summary statementDrosophila wing disc regeneration is characterized by concentric growth zones controlled by the Myc transcription factor, the Tor signaling pathway, and Myc-induced cell competition."
"Dynamic protein-protein interactions (PPIs) shape all aspects of cellular biology. Thus, significant efforts have been made to develop assays testing binary PPIs. The transparency of C. elegans makes it a great model organism for fluorescence-based PPI detection in vivo. However, to date, there is currently a lack of quantitative PPI assays that also provide information on the subcellular location of protein interactions in C. elegans. Here, we have made several modifications to the original bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay used in C. elegans to make it more quantitative and spatio-temporally controlled. First, transgenes are expressed at single copy, reducing the variability associated with multi-copy expression. Second, we have added bicistronic reference fluorescent proteins to each transgene, allowing for the normalization and quantification of the PPI. Finally, we have incorporated the auxin-inducible degradation system, allowing for small-molecule inducible control of the PPI signal. We demonstrate the utility of our modified BiFC assay by testing several model PPIs. Thus, we anticipate that our updated BiFC approach will expand the available tools for studying PPIs in C. elegans, but similar logic could be applied to other model organisms amenable to transgenesis and in vivo fluorescent imaging.

Article SummaryProtein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a central role in all facets of cellular biology. Here, we developed an improved assay to study PPIs in C. elegans, based on bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), where two halves of split-YFP can be reconstituted in an interaction-dependent manner. Our modifications include making the readout of the assay less variable and more quantitative, while also enabling signal to accumulate in an inducible manner. We envision that our updated BiFC approach will serve as a useful tool for C. elegans researchers interested in characterizing PPIs of interest in vivo."
"Cognition and its underlying neurobiology change throughout the trajectory of aging, with prominent sex differences and influences of sex-specific factors. Research has shown that parity (pregnancy and parenthood) uniquely altered various biomarkers of brain health in middle age depending on presence of Alzheimers disease (AD) risk. The present study builds on prior work by providing a comprehensive view of functional connectivity changes and elucidating how network-level dynamics contribute to cognitive outcomes depending on primiparity and APOE{varepsilon}4 genotype, the top genetic risk factor for late-onset sporadic AD risk.

We assessed neural activation in middle-aged wildtype and hAPOE{varepsilon}4 rats that were either nulliparous (0 litters) or primiparous (1 litter). Activation of the immediate early gene zif268 was quantified across 19 brain regions implicated in memory and AD. Primiparous hAPOE{varepsilon}4 rats exhibited widespread reductions in neural activation, particularly in the dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens, frontal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex. Network analyses further revealed that primiparous wildtype rats had the most cohesive and efficient functional connectivity networks. Notably, the hierarchy of influence of brain regions within the neural network shifted based on parity and hAPOE{varepsilon}4 genotype. Activation of hippocampal new-born neurons in conjunction with subregions of the dorsal striatum, frontal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex dynamically predicted cognitive performance in a parity- and genotype-dependent manner. These findings underscore the lasting impact of reproductive history on brain health and cognitive aging, highlighting the need to consider sex-specific experiences in aging and AD research."
"Protein biosynthesis and folding are tightly intertwined processes regulated by the ribosome and auxiliary factors. Nascent proteins can begin to fold on their parent ribosome but formation of the native state is often inhibited well beyond the emergence of the necessary residues from the exit tunnel. The dominant forces driving this apparent destabilisation have remained unclear. We investigate this here, combining NMR experiments and atomistic simulations of a folded nascent chain on and off the ribosome. While its native structure and internal dynamics remain unaltered, co-translational folding is disfavoured due to intermolecular electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged ribosome surface and nascent protein. Partially folded intermediates are less destabilised, resulting in their high populations. Specifically, we show that the polypeptides net charge is the dominant factor determining nascent folding thermodynamics, with smaller contributions from charge distribution. Consequently, positively charged proteins can fold on the ribosome without populating stable intermediates. These findings reconcile conflicting observations of previous studies and establish the general physical principles underpinning de novo protein folding."
"Ribosomal frameshifting allows the synthesis of a protein from different reading frames. Generally, it involves a dissociation of the P-site tRNA from its codon and movement to the +1 codon setting the new frame for incoming tRNAs. This movement is stabilized by tRNA repairing with the +1 codon. However, in several occurrences in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, P-site tRNA repairing with the +1 codon is impossible. One hypothesis suggests that frameshifting involves P-site tRNA movement, with repairing not being essential. In the alternative model the A-site tRNA acceptance at the +1 codon occurs in the absence of P-site tRNA movement. Here we performed a comparative analysis of all known +1 frameshifting sites in S. cerevisiae. In addition, we discovered a novel gene requiring +1 frameshifting for its expression. We also identified a conserved RNA structure located upstream of the ABP140 frameshifting site. This structure substantially increases frameshifting efficiency. Its location suggests that it is formed in mRNA exiting the ribosome, creating a pulling effect favouring positioning of the +1 codon in the P-site. We show that the stimulation is limited to frameshifting sites where P-site tRNA repairing is possible, supporting the existence of two distinct mechanisms of +1 ribosomal frameshifting."
"Building on the success of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in vaccines, LNPs are being developed for a broad set of therapeutic applications by changing both the structures of the lipids used to formulate each LNP and their relative proportions. Because lipid synthesis and in vivo screening have been parallelized using combinatorial chemistry and LNP barcoding respectively, the manual and sequential microfluidic formulation of LNPs has become the rate-limiting step in the discovery process. In this work, we present a high-throughput, automated microfluidic platform capable of generating large, precisely-defined LNP libraries in parallel at a rate of one distinct formulation every three seconds. Each formulation is defined by varying the reagent flow ratios into one of eight microscale mixers using litho-graphically encoded fluidic resistors and dynamically controlled external pressure supplies. The microfluidic chip is integrated with custom frobotic plate handling for the rapid collection of each distinct formulation. Using this platform, we produce a library of 96 formulations, which we profile physicochemically and evaluate in terms of both in vitro and in vivo transfection."
"Equines are parasitized by complex communities of Strongylidae (Nematoda) comprising multi-species infections. Currently, the Cyathostominae are most prevalent, while the Strongylus species are only rarely detected. Since eggs and, in most cases, infective larvae cannot be differentiated to species level, with the exception of Strongylus spp., species-specific knowledge of the pathology, epidemiology and ecology of these parasitic nematodes is limited. Reference sequence data for several cyathostomin species are limited or missing. Deep amplicon sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS-2) regions of nematodes has been used in equines previously, although barcoding studies demonstrate a better species resolution for the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) region. The present study introduces a nemabiome method based on the sequencing of COI fragments. This method was applied to compare third stage larvae, representing strongyle communities, derived from regularly treated (RT) and never treated (NT) equine populations from Brazil, France (only RT), Germany, Ukraine, the UK, and the USA. Samples were predominantly from horses, but some were obtained from Przewalskis horses (Ukraine), donkeys (Germany, Ukraine) and kulans (Ukraine). Most sequence reads (87.7%) were identified to the species level, but unclassified reads occurred more frequently in donkeys and kulans than horses. No obvious difference in species diversity and richness was observed between RT and NT equines. However, there were significant differences in species composition between the RT and NT groups. While Strongylus spp. were significantly more abundant in the NT groups, Cylicocyclus nassatus, Cylicostephanus longibursatus, and Cyathostomum catinatum were more abundant in the RT group, suggesting that strongyle communities in domestic equines may have been shaped by anthelmintic treatments in the last decades. The decreased classification success for reads from non-caballine equines suggests that there are more strongyle species specific for this rarely-investigated group and that additional efforts are needed to improve the sequence database, particularly for these hosts.

Author summaryThis study shows that long-term deworming treatments have influenced strongyle nematode communities in equines. Our findings showed that regular deworming does not always reduce species richness and diversity. Noteworthy, we observed that the more pathogenic species such as Strongylus vulgaris and Strongylus edentatus were still present but in low abundance in equines. Due to their low abundance, less sensitive diagnostic methods, such as morphological examination of larval cultures might not detect these species, which would lead to an underestimated threat in equine herds. We applied an effective metabarcoding approach based on a reliable gene marker region to accurately detect these and other strongyle species in equines. The detection of various species was more effective for horse samples than for those from donkeys and kulans. An expansion of the current database that includes more specimens from more rare species obtained from different equine species can improve identification and understanding of these complex multi-species communities in the future. In summary, the study underscores the importance of continuing monitoring equine herds based on sensitive methods such as metabarcoding to evaluate the current nematode communities and to adapt and develop treatment strategies for managing strongyle infections in equines."
"Visual search in natural environments involves numerous objects, each composed of countless features. Despite this complexity, our brain efficiently locates targets. Here, we propose that an internal reference frame facilitates real-world visual search. Objects in natural scenes often appear in orientations perceived as upright, enabling quicker recognition. However, how object orientation influences real-world visual search remains unclear. Moreover, the contributions of multiple reference cues--egocentric, visual context, and gravitational--on visual search are not well understood. To answer these questions, we designed a visual search task in virtual reality. Our results revealed an orientation effect that was independent of set size, suggesting the involvement of internal reference frame transformation. By independently rotating the virtual scene and participants in a flight simulator, we found that allocentric cues significantly altered search performance. These findings provide fundamental insights into the efficiency of real-world visual search and its connection to high-level cognitive processes."
"Many bacterial habitats, from the gut to the soil, feature narrow channels where confined flow is a key constraint that might influence the spatial organization, and thus the functioning, of the complex, phenotypically heterogeneous communities these microbes form. Here, we investigate how a model heterogeneous bacterial community of motile and non-motile Escherichia coli organizes under confined Poiseuille flow. We discovered a new mode of active self-organization, where the motile bacteria induce the rapid sideways segregation of the non-motile cells to one side of the channel, eventually resulting in asymmetric biofilm formation. Our experiments and modeling elucidated the purely physical segregation mechanism: the rheotactic drift of the motile cells, which stems from shear acting on their chiral flagella, induces a conveyer-belt-like backflow advecting the non-motile cells. The latter then accumulate thanks to sedimentation countering flow incompressibility. This unexpected consequence of motility can affect the organization of complex bacteria communities colonizing environments under confined flow."
"Diabetes mellitus is a rapidly growing global health challenge, necessitating the development of more effective anti-diabetic therapies, including drugs that improve insulin release from pancreatic {beta}-cells. Traditional high-throughput screening methods typically rely on 2D {beta}-cell cultures, but such cultures do not mimic the 3D organisation and cell-to-cell communication of {beta}-cells in pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Existing 3D {beta}-cell culture models are hindered by high costs, technical complexity, and limited compatibility with high-throughput screening platforms. In this work, we developed an approach for generating 19 homogeneously shaped pancreatic {beta}-cell spheroids in each well of a 96-well plate, using micropatterned polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based hydrogels and MIN6 insulinoma cells. The uniform shape and positioning of the individual spheroids enabled the simultaneous, real-time imaging of Ca2+ signals in up to 1824 independent spheroids in response to glucose and various test compounds. Using this approach, we show that increasing glucose causes concentration-dependent Ca2+ oscillations in individual spheroids, that these Ca2+ oscillations are sensitive to modulators of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, and that the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations correlate with insulin secretion. Finally, we demonstrate that the neurosteroid pregnenolone sulphate, an agonist of the cation channel TRPM3, increases the frequency of glucose-induced Ca2+ oscillations and enhances insulin release; the TRPM3 antagonist isosakuranetin inhibited these responses. In conclusion, we established a cost-effective and scalable 3D {beta}-cell platform for high-throughput screening of insulin release-modifying compounds, with potential applications in drug development and personalized medicine for the management of diabetes mellitus."
"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the emergence of novel variants underscore the need to understand host-virus interactions and identify host factors that restrict viral infection. Here, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify host restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2, revealing DAZAP2 as a potent antiviral gene. DAZAP2, previously implicated in SARS-CoV-2 restriction, is found to inhibit viral entry by blocking virion fusion with both endolysosomal and plasma membranes. Additionally, DAZAP2 suppresses genomic RNA replication without affecting the primary translation of viral replicases. We demonstrate that DAZAP2 functions as a pan-coronavirus restriction factor across four genera of coronaviruses. Importantly, knockout of DAZAP2 enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection in mouse models and in human primary airway epithelial cells, confirming its physiological relevance. Mechanistically, antiviral activity of DAZAP2 appears to be indirect, potentially through the regulation of host gene expression, as it primarily localizes to the nucleus. Our findings provide new insights into the host defense system against coronaviruses and highlight DAZAP2 as a potential target for host-directed antiviral therapies.

IMPORTANCEDuring viral infection, the host defense response is mediated by a variety of host factors through distinct mechanisms that have yet to be fully elucidated. Although DAZAP2 was previously implicated in SARS-CoV-2 restriction, its mechanisms of action and in vivo relevance remain unclear. In this study, we identify the DAZAP2 as a potent pan-coronavirus restriction factor that inhibits viral infection through dual mechanisms: blocking virion fusion with both endolysosomal and plasma membranes, and suppressing genomic RNA replication. We confirm its physiological relevance in host defense using mouse models and primary cell cultures. This study advances our understanding of host-pathogen interactions. Targeting DAZAP2 or its regulatory pathways could provide a new approach to enhance host defense against current and future coronavirus threats."
"Kinetochores link chromosomes to dynamic microtubules of the mitotic spindle. To ensure equal chromosome segregation, sister chromatids must achieve biorientation. The conserved kinase Aurora B phosphorylates outer kinetochore proteins on attachments lacking tension, allowing re-establishment of new connections until biorientation is achieved. Aurora B localizes to the centromere as part of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), but the underlying recruitment pathways can be eliminated without disrupting biorientation. It therefore remains unclear how the kinase operates during error correction. Here, we identify the conserved Spc105/Kre28 complex as an outer kinetochore receptor of the Aurora kinase Ipl1 and its activator Sli15 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that mutations in the helix bundle domain of Spc105/Kre28 impair mitotic error correction, resembling the effects of ipl1 or sli15 mutants. The defects can be suppressed by artificial recruitment of Ipl1. In biochemical experiments Ipl1/Sli15 directly associates with Spc105/Kre28, and a conserved segment in the Sli15 central domain is crucially involved in the binding mechanism. These results have important implications for the mechanism of tension-dependent error correction during chromosome biorientation."
"Signal peptides (SPs) are short protein segments responsible for protein localization, typically cleaved from mature proteins and rapidly degraded after fulfilling their targeting function. Beyond localization however, these sequentially and structurally diverse elements may play additional roles. We explore how alternative splicing potentially creates structural contexts where SPs become integral components of folded domains. Employing AlphaFold and additional computational approaches, we examined a known functional immune protein splice isoform of human SLAMF6 that retains biological activity, despite forming a truncated domain that lacks the central elements of the canonical interaction interface. We revealed striking characteristic similarities between the SLAMF6 SP and the absent segment, indicating its ability to complement and stabilize the isoform domain. An in silico screen of 235,000 reported expressed human isoforms identified several dozen additional candidates with potential SP complementation, previously dismissed as modeling artifacts. Notably, immunoglobulin and carbonic anhydrase domains show particular enrichment among these candidates. SPs are commonly regarded as dispensable elements that can be altered or eliminated when investigating proteins and their structures. Our research proposes an alternative perspective wherein SPs might perform integral roles in stabilizing their source proteins, or others. These findings extend the growing body of evidence for moonlighting SPs, suggesting that we have only begun to uncover their true functional scope. Specifically, SPs emerge as unique modulatory elements essential for understanding the structural and functional behavior of protein splice isoforms."
"BackgroundThis study focuses on genetic resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN), a highly contagious disease caused by an aquatic birnavirus (IPNV) which especially affects salmonids worldwide. The objectives were to estimate the heritability of IPN resistance and to fine map quantitative trait loci (QTL) using a Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model to identify candidate genes possibly linked to IPN resistance in two successive generations from a French commercial strain of rainbow trout. For each generation, 2,000 fish were experimentally exposed by bath to IPNV and mortalities were monitored daily during 5 weeks. All fish were genotyped using a medium-density 57K SNP chip and imputed to high-density genotypes (665K SNP).

ResultsThe mean survival rate was 70% after 37 days, with a higher survival rate in the second generation compared to the first one (78% versus 61%). Heritability was moderate ([~]0.20). Approximately 74% of the genetic variance of IPN resistance was explained by a few tens of SNP. In total, 25 QTL were mapped on 10 chromosomes. Among them, 7 were detected with very strong evidence on chromosomes 1, 14, 16 and 28. The most interesting QTL were associated to top SNP with mean survival rate differences over 20% between the beneficial and detrimental homozygous genotypes. Those SNP were all located within promising functional candidate genes on chromosome 1 (uts2d, rc3h1, ga45b) and chromosome 16 (irf2bp, eif2ak2), all these genes being associated to the regulation of inflammatory pathways. A key factor of the genetic differences in susceptibility to IPNV among fish is PKR, the dsRNA-dependent serine/threonine-protein kinase encoded by the eif2ak2 gene.

ConclusionsAll genes associated to the most significant QTL on chromosomes 1 and 16 are involved in the regulation of inflammatory pathways, strongly suggesting a central role of inflammation in the IPN resistance in rainbow trout. These findings offer the possibility of marker-assisted selection for rapid dissemination of genetic improvement for IPN resistance."
"BackgroundChronic social defeat stress (CSDS) leads to persistent behavioral deficits, such as social avoidance and abnormal stress responses, including freezing. Despite these fear-based responses observed during and after social defeat, the effects of prolonged exposure (PE) treatment - a well-established therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)--have not been thoroughly investigated in this context.

MethodsSocially defeated male mice were subjected to 12 days of PE treatment. We determined the efficacy of PE treatment in physically defeated mice by measuring stress responses, including freezing, jump escape, and social interaction, before and after the intervention.

ResultsAfter 12 days of PE treatment, male mice that had been physically defeated showed a marked decrease in freezing behavior. Furthermore, PE treatment changed the phenotype of mice from susceptible to resilient by reducing social avoidance during the social interaction test.

ConclusionsThese results provide a new preclinical method for investigating behavioral recovery and adaptation by showing that PE treatment can reverse significant behavioral deficits caused by social defeat stress. A new framework for examining individual variability in therapeutic outcomes after chronic stress exposure is provided by the emergence of both treatment-responsive and treatment-resistant phenotypes."
"SnRK1 (Sucrose non-fermenting-1-Related Kinase 1) is a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis in plants, coordinating developmental and metabolic responses under environmental and internal stress conditions. Here, we demonstrate that its catalytic subunit, KIN10, orchestrates organ-specific growth-defense programs in Arabidopsis thaliana through transcriptomic rewiring. Using RNA-seq profiling, we reveal that kin10 knockout mutants exhibit extensive transcriptional reprogramming in roots, particularly in pathways linked to signal perception, cell wall remodeling, and intracellular trafficking, which correlates with impaired root growth and reduced root hair elongation upon Pseudomonas syringae infection. In contrast, KIN10 overexpression (KIN10-OE) lines display constitutive defense activation in shoots, including elevated expression of genes associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and salicylic acid (SA) signaling, leading to enhanced ROS accumulation and growth trade-offs. kin10 roots show muted responses to biotic stimuli, while KIN10-OE shoots prioritize defense over growth. These findings position KIN10 as a critical integrator of energy status and immune signaling, enabling fine-tuned, tissue-specific responses essential for optimizing plant adaptation to dynamic environmental challenges."
"Lightning is an important agent of tropical tree mortality, but we know little about lightning-caused disturbances beyond one lowland tropical forest in Panama. Here we quantified variation in the frequency and severity of visually-detectable lightning-caused disturbances across topography in the montane forests of Nyungwe National Park, Rwanda. This was the first systematic assessment of lightning-caused disturbance in Africa and a preliminary test of the hypothesis that forest tolerance to lightning is higher where lightning disturbances are more common. Lightning-caused disturbances were observed six-times more frequently on ridges than in valleys, but lightning-caused disturbances in valleys tended to cause more tree-level damage than those on ridges. Overall, lightning disturbances tended to kill a lower proportion of trees in this Afromontane forest than in previously documented lightning disturbances in tropical America. We also observed less tree-level damage to Syzygium spp.(Myrtaceae) compared to the community-wide average, providing support for taxonomic differences in lightning tolerance. Our results indicate that lightning disturbance severity differs within and among sites, mediated in part by differences in lightning tolerance among tree species, and provide some support for the hypothesis that disturbance severity declines with disturbance frequency."
"Aims/hypothesisCulture-expanded mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) reduce immune cell activation and improve islet functional survival. However, little is known about native human pancreatic MSCs (npMSCs) in health or how they are altered in type 1 diabetes. Here, we determined the number, density and islet-protective phenotype of npMSCs in situ in control individuals and those with type 1 diabetes.

MethodsMultiplex immunohistochemistry was used to identify npMSCs (CD90+/CD105+/CD73+/CD31-/CD45-/CD34-) in human pancreas sections from 38 donors (Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes and Exeter Archival Diabetes Biobank). Donors were categorised as either < 13 years at type 1 diabetes diagnosis (n = 8) or [&ge;] 13 years at type 1 diabetes diagnosis (n = 11) or were age- and sex-matched individuals without diabetes. Consecutive sections were immunostained with antisera against insulin, glucagon, and the established islet-protective and immunomodulatory factors Annexin A1 (ANXA1) and indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase-1. Whole-slide scans were acquired and npMSCs either inside or at the periphery (within 10 {micro}m) of islets were quantified on an individual-islet basis. We identified 53,375 npMSCs and performed an analysis of 26,376 individual islets. Culture-expanded MSCs were exposed to cytokines and viability and proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry.

ResultsnpMSC were identified in situ in the human pancreas where they wrap around the islet periphery in an expected spindle-like morphology. ANXA1 was expressed by 33.2% of npMSCs and was expressed constitutively among individuals with or without diabetes. The density of both intraislet npMSCs and npMSCs within 10 {micro}m of the islet periphery was increased for insulin-containing islets in individuals with type 1 diabetes compared to individuals without diabetes (p < 0.001). npMSC density within 10 {micro}m of the islet periphery was preferentially increased in individuals [&ge;] 13 years at type 1 diabetes diagnosis compared to individuals < 13 years at type 1 diabetes diagnosis (p < 0.001). npMSC density was reduced around insulin-deficient islets compared to insulin-containing islets in individuals with diabetes (p < 0.001), consistent with an islet-protective role for npMSCs. Exposure of culture-expanded MSCs to an aggressive cytokine combination led to increased cell death and reduced proliferation.

Conclusion/interpretationnpMSCs express ANXA1 constitutively suggesting an islet-protective role in health. The density of npMSCs was increased around insulin-containing islets and lost around insulin-deficient islets in individuals with type 1 diabetes which aligns with this hypothesis. npMSC density at the periphery of insulin-containing islets was preferentially higher in individuals with later onset type 1 diabetes, correlating with a less intense immune cell infiltration. The reduced ability of npMSCs to survive in the more intense pro-inflammatory environment around islets in younger onset type 1 diabetes may contribute to the rapid rate of beta cell loss in these individuals.

Research in context

What is already known about the subject?* Culture-expanded mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) reduce immune cell activation and improve islet functional survival.

* Therapeutically administered MSCs migrate to sites of injury and preserve endogenous C-peptide in individuals with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.

What is the key question?* Is the number, distribution and/or cytoprotective and immunomodulatory phenotype of native pancreatic MSCs (npMSCs) altered in type 1 diabetes?

What are the new findings?* npMSCs express typical markers of isolated, culture-expanded MSCs and their number and density is increased within and at the periphery of insulin-containing islets in individuals with type 1 diabetes.

* npMSCs are more abundant at the periphery of islets in individuals with later onset type 1 diabetes, correlating with a less intense immune cell infiltration.

* MSCs are less able to survive an aggressive inflammatory environment such as that arising from the enhanced islet immune cell infiltration in individuals with younger onset type 1 diabetes

How might this impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?* Therapeutically administered MSCs are likely to be more effective at preserving endogenous beta cell mass in individuals with later onset type 1 diabetes where MSCs have a greater ability to survive and exert their therapeutic functions."
"With the increasing availability of genomic data, biologists aim to find more accurate descriptions of evolutionary histories influenced by secondary contact, where diverging lineages reconnect before diverging again. Such reticulate evolutionary events can be more accurately represented in phylogenetic networks than in phylogenetic trees. Since the root location of phylogenetic networks can not be inferred from biological data under several evolutionary models, we consider semi-directed (phylogenetic) networks: partially directed graphs without a root in which the directed edges represent reticulate evolutionary events. By specifying a known outgroup, the rooted topology can be recovered from such networks. We introduce the algorithm SO_SCPLOWQUIRRELC_SCPLOW (Semi-directed Quarnet-based Inference to Reconstruct Level-1 Networks) which constructs a semi-directed level-1 network from a full set of quarnets (four-leaf semi-directed networks). Our method also includes a heuristic to construct such a quarnet set directly from sequence alignments. We demonstrate SO_SCPLOWQUIRRELC_SCPLOWs performance through simulations and on real sequence data sets, the largest of which contains 29 aligned sequences close to 1.7 Mbp long. The resulting networks are obtained on a standard laptop within a few minutes. Lastly, we prove that SO_SCPLOWQUIRRELC_SCPLOW is combinatorially consistent: given a full set of quarnets coming from a triangle-free semi-directed level-1 network, it is guaranteed to reconstruct the original network. SO_SCPLOWQUIRRELC_SCPLOW is implemented in Python, has an easy-to-use graphical user-interface that takes sequence alignments or quarnets as input, and is freely available at https://github.com/nholtgrefe/squirrel."
"While affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) has significantly advanced protein-protein interaction (PPI) studies, its limitations in detecting weak, transient, and membrane-associated interactions remain. To address these challenges, we introduced an innovative proteomic method termed Affinity Purification coupled Proximity LabEling-Mass Spectrometry (APPLE-MS), which combines the high specificity of Twin-Strep-tag enrichment with PafA-mediated proximity labeling. This method achieves unprecedented sensitivity while maintaining high specificity (4.07-fold over AP-MS). APPLE-MS also revealed the dynamic mitochondrial interactome of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9B during antiviral responses, while endogenous PIN1 profiling uncovered novel roles in DNA replication. Notably, APPLE-MS enabled in situ mapping of GLP-1 receptor complexes, demonstrating its unique capabilities for membrane PPI studies. This versatile method advances interactome research by providing comprehensive, physiologically relevant PPI networks, opening new opportunities for mechanistic discovery and therapeutic targeting.

However, it still faces several limitations, including high levels of non-specific binding, challenges in detecting weak interactions, and limited ability to identify PPIs at the cell surface in situ. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a modular AP-MS method enhanced by PafA-mediated proximity labeling, which improves both the specificity and sensitivity of PPI detection in a single, streamlined workflow.

SIGNIFICANCE - Cell Chemical Biology onlyProximity labeling is a powerful tool in chemical biology, providing critical support for studying protein function, cell signaling, and disease mechanisms by chemically labeling and capturing biomolecular interactions. In this study, we introduce a modular affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) method that integrates proximity labeling. This method leverages the proximity-dependent enzymatic activity of PafA to covalently attach PupE to nearby proteins, in combination with the high-affinity interaction between Twin-Strep-tag and streptavidin to achieve efficient binding. This innovative approach enables precise identification of protein-protein interactions (PPIs), offering a powerful tool for capturing weak and transient interactions that are often missed by traditional AP-MS techniques. By enhancing both the specificity and efficiency of protein labeling, our work provides a robust chemical biology strategy to elucidate complex protein interactions, which are essential for understanding cellular processes and developing targeted therapeutic strategies, offering new insights into protein function and interaction dynamics in both health and disease."
"Visual recognition is limited by both object size (acuity) and spacing. The spacing limit, called ""crowding"", is the failure to recognize an object in the presence of other objects. Here, we take advantage of individual differences in crowding to investigate its biological basis. Crowding distance, the minimum object spacing needed for recognition, varies 2-fold among healthy adults. We test the conjecture that this variation in psychophysical crowding distance is due to variation in cortical map size. To test this, we made paired measurements of brain and behavior in 50 observers. We used psychophysics to measure crowding distance and calculate{lambda} , the number of letters that fit into each observers visual field without crowding. In the same observers, we used fMRI to measure the surface area A (mm{superscript 2}) of retinotopic maps V1, V2, V3, and V4. Across observers,{lambda} is proportional to the surface area of V4 but is uncorrelated with the surface area of V1 to V3. The proportional relationship of{lambda} to area of V4 indicates conservation of cortical crowding distance across individuals: letters can be recognized if they are spaced by at least 1.4 mm on the V4 map, irrespective of map size and psychophysical crowding distance. We conclude that the size of V4 predicts the spacing limit of visual perception."
"Rapidly developing microbial resistance to existing antimicrobials poses a growing threat to public health and global food security. Current chemical-based treatments target cells by inhibiting growth or metabolic function, but their effectiveness is diminishing. To address the growing antimicrobial resistance crisis, there is an urgent need for innovative therapies. Conjugative plasmids, a natural mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, have been repurposed to deliver toxic genetic cargo to recipient cells, showing promise as next-generation antimicrobial agents. However, the ecological risks posed by unintended gene transfer require robust biocontainment strategies. In this study, we developed inducible conjugative plasmids to solve these challenges. Utilizing an arabinose-inducible promoter, we evaluated 13 plasmids with single essential gene deletions, identifying trbC and trbF as strong candidates for stringent regulation. These plasmids demonstrated inducibility in both cis and trans configurations, with induction resulting in up to a 5-log increase in conjugation efficiency compared to uninduced conditions. Although challenges such as reduced conjugation efficiency and promoter leakiness persist, this work establishes a foundation for the controlled transfer of plasmids, paving the way for safer and more effective antimicrobial technologies."
"The exponential growth of scientific publications presents opportunities for researchers to identify valuable knowledge, especially in the highly interdisciplinary field --- biomaterials, where exploiting possible connections between unmet clinical needs and materials properties from literatures is crucial. However, with traditional literature reading, it is extremely challenging to marry unmet clinical needs with existing materials reported for different applications or other purposes. Here, to provide a not-renally cleared therapeutics for renally impaired hyperuricemia patients, we designed a multi-tiered framework MatWISE that fuses state-of-the-art natural language processing, semantic relationship mapping, and machine learning to automate the complex process of material discovery from a sea of scientific literatures published until December of 2022, and successfully identified and optimized {delta}-MnO2 into an orally administered, nonabsorbable uric acid (UA) lowering biomaterial. {delta}-MnO2 had superior serum and urine UA-lowering effect in three hyperuricemia mouse models, by comparing with a standard of care drug. {delta}-MnO2 is highly promising to serve as a safe and effective UA-lowering drug for renally impaired hyperuricemia patients. We demonstrated a new research paradigm for biomaterials that combining state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and a handful of experiments to discover a translationally relevant material from the massive existing research, for an unmet clinical need."
"Phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein at serine 129 (PS129) has been strongly associated with aggregates and implicated in the synucleinopathy disease processes. Recent findings suggest that PS129 is abundant in the non-synucleinopathy mammalian brain, in a brain region-specific and context-dependent manner, raising important questions about the significance of PS129 for synucleinopathy disease processes. Here, we identified and described phosphatase labile physiological PS129 in the mammalian brain using a range of specimens from rodent to human surgically resected temporal lobectomy tissues. Results confirmed phosphatase-sensitive physiological PS129 in the non-synucleinopathy human temporal lobe and hippocampus when the post-mortem interval was eliminated (i.e., surgically resected human samples or perfusion-fixed animal brain). In the non-synucleinopathy mammalian brain, PS129 fluctuated between 2-45% of the total asyn pool in a case-specific and brain region-specific manner. In agreement with previous studies, physiological PS129 was abundantly distributed throughout the layers of the hippocampus and cortex. Physiological PS129 was not observed in PD brain, or non-synucleinopathy specimens of >2h post-mortem interval. Remarkably, in the PD brain, the PS129 to asyn ratio was similar ([~]5-40%) to that in the non-synucleinopathy brain. Despite physiological PS129 being associated with neuronal activity, physiological PS129 did not correlate with cFos expression. Conclusions: Physiological PS129 is abundant in the human brain, and apparent pathological enrichment, in part, can be explained by the enzymatic resistance of aggregates and not disease-driven phosphorylation events."
"MotivationStudying protein isoforms is an essential step in biomedical research; at present, the main approach for analyzing proteins is via bottom-up mass spectrometry proteomics, which return peptide identifications, that are indirectly used to infer the presence of protein isoforms. However, the detection and quantification processes are noisy; in particular, peptides may be erroneously detected, and most peptides, known as shared peptides, are associated to multiple protein isoforms. As a consequence, studying individual protein isoforms is challenging, and inferred protein results are often abstracted to the gene-level or to groups of protein isoforms.

ResultsHere, we introduce IsoBayes, a novel statistical method to perform inference at the isoform level. Our method enhances the information available, by integrating mass spectrometry proteomics and transcriptomics data in a Bayesian probabilistic framework. To account for the uncertainty in the measurement process, we propose a two-layer latent variable approach: first, we sample if a peptide has been correctly detected (or, alternatively filter peptides); second, we allocate the abundance of such selected peptides across the protein(s) they are compatible with. This enables us, starting from peptide-level data, to recover protein-level data; in particular, we: i) infer the presence/absence of each protein isoform (via a posterior probability), ii) estimate its abundance (and credible interval), and iii) target isoforms where transcript and protein relative abundances significantly differ.

We benchmarked our approach in simulations, and in two multi-protease real datasets: our method displays good sensitivity and specificity when detecting protein isoforms, its estimated abundances highly correlate with the ground truth, and can detect changes between protein and transcript relative abundances.

Availability and implementationIsoBayes is freely distributed as a Bioconductor R package, and is accompanied by an example usage vignette."
"Plasma membranes (PMs) exhibit asymmetry between their two leaflets in terms of phospholipid headgroups, unsaturation, and resulting membrane properties such as packing and fluidity. Lateral heterogeneity, including the formation of lipid domains, is another crucial aspect of PMs with significant biological implications. However, the nature and even the existence of lipid domains in the two leaflets of PMs remain elusive, hindering a complete understanding of the significance of lipid asymmetry. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of the asymmetric PM, we find that the outer leaflet predominantly adopts a liquid-ordered state, whereas the inner leaflet separates into nanoscale ({approx}10 nm) liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domains, exhibiting highly dynamic fusion and fission events. This structural asymmetry is further reinforced by asymmetric lateral stress resulting from a cholesterol bias toward the outer leaflet. These findings suggest distinct functional roles for the two leaflets, modulated by asym-metric lateral stress. Additionally, comparing the phase behavior of asymmetric and fully scrambled PMs reveals a key determinant of domain size: intact PMs maintain nanoscale domains, while cell-derived giant PM vesicles, which have lost the strict lipid asymmetry, exhibit microscale domains."
"Cardiometabolic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogenous metabolic disease, which in the heart presents as left ventricle diastolic dysfunction, ventricular stiffness, and myocardial structural remodeling. Deleterious changes in cardiac metabolism are central to HFpEF pathophysiology, and proposed treatments for the disease have focused on repairing these defects. In this study, we used a preclinical mouse model that recapitulates cardiometabolic HFpEF to elucidate the molecular mechanisms driving cardiac dysfunction, and tested whether recombinant Adropin (a liver- and brain-derived peptide hormone) could reverse observed defects. We show that long-term treatment with Adropin reversed multiple markers of HFpEF-related cardiac dysfunction (including fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy). Using untargeted metabolomics, we found that Adropin treatment restricted deleterious metabolite entry into the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, leading to a reduction in the inhibitory O-GlcNAcylation of the cardiac fatty acid oxidation enzyme long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Our results suggest that Adropin may restore cardiac metabolic function in HFpEF, and that targeting this pathway may be a novel therapeutic avenue for this disease."
"Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has revolutionized treatment for B-cell malignancies, yet over 60% of patients relapse within one year, often due to insufficient CAR-T persistence. While mouse and primary cell models have been instrumental in advancing CAR-T therapy, they frequently fail to predict clinical outcomes, underscoring the need for more translationally relevant models. To address this limitation, we conducted the first systematic evaluation of CAR structure-function relationships in an immunocompetent nonhuman primate (NHP) model. We engineered an array of 20 CD20-targeted CARs with distinct combinations of hinge, transmembrane, and costimulatory domains. Following ex vivo characterization, we administered pooled autologous CAR-T arrays to three NHPs and tracked CAR abundance longitudinally using a novel digital droplet PCR assay. Ex vivo, CAR-T cells incorporating the MyD88-CD40 costimulatory domain exhibited markedly distinct functional profiles, including increased activation, unique cytokine secretion, tonic signaling, and resistance to exhaustion. In vivo, MyD88-CD40 CARs expanded dramatically, comprising up to 100% of peripheral T cells and significantly outperforming canonical CD28- and 4-1BB-based CARs. This expansion was associated with robust B-cell depletion across all animals. MyD88-CD40 CARs, particularly those with a CD28 hinge and transmembrane domain, demonstrated superior trafficking to secondary lymphoid tissues and persistence through study endpoint, unlike other CARs which waned by day 28. Our findings highlight the value of NHP models for screening CAR designs and identify MyD88-CD40 CARs as candidates with unmatched potency. The unique functional attributes conferred by this domain may provide key insights into features that drive enhanced CAR-T cell activity.

Key pointsO_LIWe developed the first pooled CAR-T screening platform in an immunocompetent nonhuman primate model to directly compare CAR designs.
C_LIO_LIWe identified MyD88-CD40 costimulatory domain as vastly superior to conventional domains in proliferation, trafficking and persistence.

"Maternal aggression is a core feature of rodent maternal behaviour to defend their offspring from potential threats and is modulated by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and oxytocin (OXT) systems signalling. Here, we investigated the involvement of those neuropeptide systems in maternal aggression within the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh), a central region of the reward and maternal circuits. Infusion of CRF or Urocortin3 (CRF-receptor 2 agonist), as well as an OXT receptor antagonist, reduced maternal aggression, suggesting a role in pup defence. Furthermore, the effects of CRF infusion in the NAcSh continued beyond the maternal defence test (MDT), reducing nursing and increasing self-grooming. Corroborating the involvement of the stress system in maternal aggression, colocalization of CRF and cFos immunoreactive cells were increased in response to the MDT, regardless of pup presence. In addition, MDT exposure increased intra-NAc OXT release in lactating rats, which could be also triggered by local retrodialysis of CRF, but not Urocortin3. However, both ligands of the CRF system elicited dopamine (DA) release in different dynamics. Crh-r1 were predominantly expressed in the medial NAc on medium-sized spiny neurons (MSN), but also in the rostral part on GABAergic interneurons. Crh-r2 were mainly expressed in the rostral NAc and its expression on GABAergic interneurons increased towards the caudal pole. Lastly, we identified CRF-enriched projections to the NAcSh descending from the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the paraventricular thalamus, among others.

In conclusion, intra-NAcSh dampened CRF system activity and enhanced OXT system transmission are indispensable for successful pup defence. Any perturbations like increased CRF system signalling might activate compensatory mechanisms to ensure adequate maternal behaviour."
"Antibody translation across species offers a compelling strategy to extend the vast and expensive investments in human therapeutic antibodies to veterinary oncology, with applications in both veterinary medicine and comparative oncology.

While precise, low-immunogenic treatments are essential for canine cancer care, traditional species conversion methods rely on ad hoc bioinformatics modifications. These methods often implicitly decouple the framework (FR) and complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), ignoring how structural changes in FRs can affect the conformation and function of CDRs. This can compromise binding specificity and require costly high-throughput in vitro screening.

To address this, we present DoggifAI, a transformer model that translates non-canine antibody sequences into canine ones by generating species-appropriate framework regions (FRs) based on desired CDRs. This allows the model to better preserve structural compatibility between FRs and CDRs. The model is pretrained in a T5-style text-to-text denoising task on a large multispecies antibody dataset, which allows further finetuning on a much smaller species-specific dataset.

DoggifAI generates highly canine-like antibodies and shows promising results in preserving binding specificity. To support further progress in this field, we also release a curated dataset of over 430,000 unique canine antibody chain sequences, significantly expanding the public sequence repertoire.

"The effect of salt on coacervation of synthetic or biological polyelectrolytes is well-studied. However, recent experiments showed that largely neutral IDPs like FUS also undergo LLPS at physiological salt concentrations, dissolve at higher salt concentration and again phase separate at higher salt concentrations such as, [Cion][~]3M. Here we use analytical theory and simulations to reveal the mechanism of these transitions. At low [Cion], the ionic solution acts as a highly correlated medium conferring long-range effective attractive interactions between spatially distant FUS monomers. In this regime the ion concentration inside the condensate is higher than in the bulk solution. As [Cion] increases, the correlation length in the ionic plasma decreases, and the condensate dissolves. Second LLPS at high [Cion] is due to the entropy-driven crowding, and ion concentration inside the condensate is lower than in the bulk. Our study unravels a general physical mechanism of salt-dependent reentrant behavior in LLPS in neutral IDPs."
