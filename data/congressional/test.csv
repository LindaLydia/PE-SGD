"Mr. Chair, the first quarter of 2025 figures I have been provided meet and exceed the reductions that have been targeted."
"We have long argued that Iran should not be capable of having a nuclear weapon, and what happened on Saturday night was a big step to alleviating that threat. That was the subject of many comments at the NATO summit, along with the congratulations for the ceasefire that has now been brokered and the emphasis we now need on getting Iran  around the negotiating table, because if it is to be irreversible and verifiable, it is important that it is done through negotiation. That is what we are focused on."
"a dream come true and answer to prayers has been the restoration of friendship of the people of Bulgaria with America after decades of separation by the Iron Curtain. The latest achievement has been the establishment in the National Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria of the Friendship Group Bulgaria-- USA. This duplicates the Bulgarian Caucus I founded in 2004 in the U.S. Congress, which I now co-chair with Congressman Brad Schneider of Illinois, confirming Republican and Democrat appreciation of Bulgaria and valued Bulgarian-Americans. My affection for the people of Bulgaria began when I was selected by Lee Atwater ofthe Reagan Administration to be an observer of the Bulgarian National Assembly elections on June 10, 1990, on behalf of the International Republican Institute. With the collapse of the Soviet Empire, countries of Europe, the Baltics, Central Europe, and Central Asia conducted the first post-communist elections, replacing totalitarian dictatorships. Before arriving in Sofia, my research incorrectly identified Bulgaria appreciated being the most subservient Soviet satellite. Upon arriving, I found that this was not true as it was instantly inspiring to meet courageous Bulgarian patriots restoring democracy, which had been destroyed by Nazis and communists. Additionally, getting my attention was that Bulgaria and my home state of South Carolina were so similar--beautiful beaches to the east, mountains to the west, and our respective capitals of Sofia and Columbia are both in the center. I enjoy confirming to Bulgarians that an extraordinary feature in Bulgaria that we do not have in South Carolina are the phenomenal structures and antiquities of ancient Thrace, Greece, and Rome being the foundation of Western Civilization and remain to remind us of our shared heritage. Pumping gas myself in college, I especially understand gas stations. In 1990, arriving Bulgaria, I only recognized that a pathetic building appearing as an outhouse was actually a gas station because there were lines of cars waiting patiently--with no gas. Then, I found out the cars were not actually cars, but Russian Ladas and East German Trabants, being 2-stroke motorcycle engines with a hood. Now, I see modern Circle K's convenience stores fully stocked with a Wendy's or a Lukoil with a Burger King. And especially good, many cars are now X-5 BMW's made in South Carolina--and I want every Bulgarian to have a BMW. The foundation of the Friendship Group Bulgaria--USA encourages Black Sea patriots of Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia who are under attack by war criminal Putin who is insanely seeking to resurrect the failed Soviet Union, oppressing the people of Russia. One day, Russians will liberate themselves for freedom. Last month, I was honored to meet with Defense Minister Atanas Zapryanov and Ambassador Georgi Panayatov, with talented Bulgarian pilots in Greenville, South Carolina, receiving F-22 jet fighters produced by Lockheed Martin. We join valued NATO allies Romania and Turkiye in support of Bulgaria, as Bulgaria is a vital ally with the Novo Selo NATO Base, where young Bulgarians and young Americans train side-by-side for Peace Through Strength."
"Moving on then, as that has answered my question--[Interruption.] Yes, it was an excellent answer. What steps are the Government taking to reduce the time that LGBTQ+ veterans are having to wait for their financial redress applications? I look forward to hearing an update on that later on. Finally, what action are the Government taking to address disproportionate rates of mental ill health and homelessness among the LGBTQ+ community? The Minister referred to a review, which I believe is to be chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, but we really do need urgent action now. Let's celebrate Pride Month while remembering that the fight for LGBTQ+ rights is far from over. The Liberal Democrats will continue to lead it, and we will not stop until everyone is free to live as their true selves, without fear and without apology."
"I thank the hon. Lady for her question, but the equalities analysis was done. Unusually, the poverty impact analysis was also published over the last year. I do not agree with the statement that she has just made, but she is right to say that we need to make sure that we are improving things for pensioners. As I said before, this Government's priority is to keep raising the state pension and to rescue the NHS. As I said, one in five over-75s are currently on an NHS waiting list, and the funding to make that happen is possible only because of the tax rises that I hear the Liberal Democrats oppose week in, week out."
"I welcome the sanctions outlined by my hon. Friend today, and I thank him for all the work he has done. I know his commitment to the Palestinian people and the concerns he has, which he shares with us on a regular basis. Action has been required for some time. The up and coming UN conference on a two-state solution is an opportunity to work with allies or alone to recognise the Palestinian state. May I add my voice to that request and ask my hon. Friend: if not then, when?"
Will the right hon. Member give way?
"Madam Chair, with all due respect, I think that is what the minister is presuming. Were these carbon tax rebate cheques that were sent out in the middle of an election to buy votes in eight provinces delivered without the tax that funded them being collected?"
"As the hon. Gentleman will know, chalk streams already have protections in national planning policy, but I am sure that we will continue this discussion on Report of the Planning and Infrastructure Bill later today."
"For questions and comments, the hon. member for Okanagan Lake West—South Kelowna has the floor."
"Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. My understanding is that the Member should shout and make it clear on the Floor of  the House that he does not wish the amendment to be put to the vote, so that Members can voice their opinion."
"I also welcome--[Interruption.] It is very unusual for me to welcome anything from the Secretary of State but I welcome this announcement, because nuclear is an important element in providing the baseload for electricity across the United Kingdom. He mentioned delivery five times in his statement, but this is an announcement not a delivery, and there is a period when we will still need the baseload to be provided. Can he tell us how he intends to ensure that the baseload is provided in that interim period, and what discussions he has had with the Economy Minister in Northern Ireland about the suitability of SMRs for supply in Northern Ireland?"
"Mr. Speaker, that is absolutely true, whether in this case or any other case where people find that administrative processes take a really long time or genuinely harm their financial situation. I would just like to come back to the subject to say one thing. What matters to this government in terms of administrative processes is integrating AI and making Canadians our primary concern. I would also like to remind everyone here that, rather than turning this into a partisan wedge issue, our responsibility as members of Parliament is to strengthen public confidence and put our trust in our public servants and in our system. This is the message we need to send to Canadians."
"Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. I have just seen the headline in The Telegraph that dropped at just after 10 o'clock this morning which says, ""I've read the Defence Review"". This journalist must have been fully briefed and handed a copy of it, long before anybody else. Surely that is an abuse."
"Mr. Speaker, although my colleague's speech was very interesting and very good, I would like to address two things that she said. First, she mentioned that old refrain from the election campaign, specifically “think big, be Canadian”. In other words, Canada has to be “big”. The President of the United States is a bad guy, and the situation is urgent. Then my colleague regurgitated all the old measures that were in the budget presented six months ago by the minister who replaced the former finance minister, who resigned because the previous budget was so bad. We keep hearing how serious the situation is. It was pretty obvious in question period today that the Minister of Finance has no interest in drafting a budget. He is interested in one thing: making announcements. When he is asked if there will be a budget, he replies that an announcement will be made in such and such a riding. The Minister of Finance is not interested in public finances. He is interested in making announcements. My colleague said in her speech that the government has made some great announcements. A government needs a budget to govern. Does my colleague believe that her government should present a budget this spring, as any responsible government would do?"
"I rise today to honor the life and legacy of the late Deacon Martin Prosper. Deacon Prosper was a kind and active member of the Prince George's County and Greater Washington community. His life embodied faith, perseverance, and community service. Deacon Prosper immigrated to the United States from Haiti in 1979 and settled in Capitol Heights, MD, where he quickly established a warm and inviting presence in the community. Affectionally known as ``25,'' his deep connection to the Haitian and African-American communities allowed him to bridge the gap between generations and positively impact countless lives. Above all, Deacon Prosper's life was rooted in his faith and ministry. In his role as deacon at Holy Temple Church of Christ, he ministered with humility and love and regularly opened his home as a safe haven to family and friends. Deacon Prosper's humility, professionalism, and compassion served him well in his hospitality career at the Holiday Inn Washington Capitol and Gaylord National Resort in National Harbor. He was also a proud member of UNITE HERE Local 25, where he championed worker dignity and solidarity. His exceptional hospitality earned him the Regional Apple of the Year Award in 1992. I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our appreciation and gratitude to the late Deacon Martin Prosper and his family for his enduring contributions to the hospitality industry and organized labor and his unwavering faith-based service."
"I move that the House do now adjourn. The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 4 o'clock and 27 minutesp.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow, Wednesday, June 25, 2025, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate."
"Mr. Speaker, I am very familiar with all the Liberal government touts. I have been hearing, over and again, the Liberal talking points for days. My point is that this top-down approach of cabinet ministers sitting in ivory towers in Ottawa has proven to not be effective at getting our natural resources developed. The people of Newfoundland and Labrador have suffered immensely as a result of this approach by government deciding it knows best. This is the problem: the arrogance and the idea that it knows best and it touts itself. Meanwhile, people are out of work, out of money and out of time. It is time to get to work."
"Holyhead Towing in my constituency has vessels in the middle east, specifically in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE. The company is keeping its crew updated to the best of its knowledge. What official advice or guidance is available for UK maritime operators working in the region?"
"Is that all that the right hon. Lady can go on? After 14 years, the Conservatives broke the education system. As I said, guidance is already in place for schools, and the majority of schools already have a ban on mobile phone use."
The hon. member for Windsor West.
"The last Conservative Government added 27,000 extra teachers. Although we would never know it from the Minister's answer, there are 400 fewer teachers in our schools than last year. Labour promised 6,500 more teachers, but it is ignoring the loss of 2,900 primary school teachers, because apparently they do not count. The loss of teachers is not a coincidence. The Confederation of School Trusts and the Association of School and College Leaders have shown that schools have been left up to 35% short in compensation for the national insurance rise. Will Ministers finally admit that they broke their promise to fully compensate schools for that tax rise?"
"during the week of June 2, 2025, I was unable to attend several votes due to a family medical issue. Had I been present, I would have voted: YEA on Roll Call No. 146; YEA on Roll Call No. 147; YEA on Roll Call No. 150; YEA on Roll Call No. 151; YEA on Roll Call No. 152; NAY on Roll Call No. 153; YEA on Roll Call No. 154; and NAY on Roll Call No. 155."
"Mr. Chair, I do not."
"Mr. Chair, that is an excellent answer. I will come back to that. Where would one find in the main estimates how much money flowed to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission?"
"I am delighted that my hon. Friend's constituents will benefit from the PS70 million investment. These machines are game changing and will reduce the number of visits for his constituents. They are also  more reliable, which gives more capacity to the system. That is better for staff, as there will be less appointment cancellations. That is exactly the sort of thing we want to see more of, and we are delivering that under this Government. It is the result of our drive to reduce long waits and treat more people quicker. That was reinforced in last week's spending review, and it is exactly what his constituents deserve."
"I was diagnosed and went through the journey of early-stage breast cancer during the covid pandemic. Does my hon. Friend agree that it is important that the system understands that breast cancer can present in younger women, not just in older women?"
"The Minister is well aware of my interest in the F-35 programme. Lockheed Martin manufactures around 150 jets a year, and there are nearly 600 on order by everyone from Switzerland to Singapore. On top of that, there are 1,200 still to be delivered to the US air force, so whereabouts are we in the queue? She mentioned that we would expect the first deliveries before the end of decade, but are we cutting to the front of the line? Given that the orders from some allies are not due to be fulfilled until 2032, will delivery of all 12 planes be completed within a decade? On refuelling, will she clarify that we have no sovereign air-to-air refuelling capability outside of a NATO mission?"
"Barking community hospital in my constituency has been providing antenatal services to mothers in Barking for many years, and women also use its services to give birth. I was therefore really disappointed when I heard last week that the maternity birthing unit is likely to close. Many in my community are deeply concerned. They are being redirected to Newham hospital, which the Care Quality Commission has rated as ""requires improvement"". Women deserve to give birth in a safe clinical environment. Will Ministers ensure that additional attention and resources are provided to Newham hospital, so that it improves its standards and my constituents who are being redirected to give birth there can do so in a safe clinical space?"
"Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague is trying to give a speech. We cannot hear him because there is—"
"I rise today to honor Sergeant Stephan Wiggins, a Vero Beach native and Vietnam war hero who was recently awarded the Army Commendation Medal for his past service this past Memorial Day, 57 years after making the ultimate sacrifice in service to our Nation. In 1967, Sergeant Wiggins was drafted into the United States Army and quickly rose to the rank of sergeant and tank commander. Sergeant Wiggins was leading a combat patrol during the Tet Offensive when his unit encountered an obstacle. Acting quickly, he directed his track through a nearby gap, exposing a hidden enemy ambush and drawing heavy fire. The 4-hour firefight claimed 10 American lives, including Wiggins', whose bravery saved many others. I am proud to have been part of a recent ceremony honoring his legacy and his bravery to the American public."
"Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the speech, and it honestly sounded like most of it was written by the government PR department. It was something I might have heard on a reel in EPCOT Center at the Canada Pavilion, although there was some discussion about Bill C-3 . When this was at committee last, Conservatives asked many questions about how many people it would potentially give citizenship to, and we had trouble getting a number from the government. I wonder if the member can enlighten us on how many people this bill would affect and how many new citizens it would create. If she does not have a number, I would ask if she thinks it makes sense to create a new citizenship bill without actually knowing how it is going to impact Canada."
Order. I could not hear anything. The member can start over.
"First, the Ministers, who I like personally and rate a lot, unfortunately do not control the timetable of Government business. Secondly, they do not have a Bill in the King's Speech. Thirdly, my prediction is that they will be promoted before this new Bill comes to pass. The speeches were honest, but what they exposed is that there is no time commitment whatever from those on the Government Benches to bring back a Bill to this House to address the current property theft raining down on the UK creative industries. That is why the creative industries and the debate in the other place, which we listened to yesterday, are so passionate. Theft of the property rights of composers, writers, filmmakers and other creatives have been happening for years. They continue to happen and will continue to happen until the new Bill comes forward; greater and greater volumes of intellectual property and hard-fought rights falling into the AI hopper never to be seen again, and no system of redress other than expensive legal action to get it back. How would we feel if it was our own property, business or land--if it was removed without us even being asked, with the gentle reassurance that we could take action retrospectively? Creatives are desperate. Most do not have the workers' rights the majority of us have, or things such as pensions or holiday pay; all they have is their intellectual property rights. Where will the incentive be now to toil for weeks, months and years creating a piece of music or writing a text, only to have it snatched away when success arrives?  There is an irony, with the Government returning shortly with the Employment Rights Bill, that creative workers' rights continue to be so eroded. The transparency amendment in front of us today is a much diluted version of the previous Kidron amendments sent to us from the other place. It sets out a clear timeline for when the Government must return with a Bill, which is a modest request; the Government will still be able to delay the Bill, should they want to, and, to be honest, the creative industries will still not have the opportunity to protect their works in the meantime. The amendment should be accepted because it will provide reassurance to a key UK sector. However, it should also be accepted as an example of our two Chambers respecting each other. No one in the debate yesterday, listening to the words of Baroness Kidron, Lord Forsyth or others, could feel they were trying to cause the Government problems. Each and every supporter of the amendment did so on the basis of support for the rights of those working in one of the UK's leading economic sectors, who are pleading with us for their survival and to work positively with this new technological development. Our politics is currently jam-packed with black and white positions and an instinct to jump to disagreement and polarisation. The Lords amendment before us today represents a modest proposal to disagree well, and the Government should accept it."
"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The hon. Member will want to be accurate in what she says about prison places. Does she accept that we added 13,000 prison places during our time in office?"
"Mr. Speaker, the reality of the situation is that when Pierre Poilievre sat in the Conservative caucus with Stephen Harper, they cancelled the ability for someone to sponsor a mother, a father or a grandparent. They cancelled it and did not allow people to do that. They also hit the delete button on the skilled worker employment program, literally deleting hundreds of thousands of people in the system even though they spent thousands of dollars individually to get into the system. The member makes reference to the waiting time for marriages, which is not three years, but I can tell him that under Stephen Harper, it was up to six years. If I were provided the time, I could assure the member that the immigration system today is better. We finally have a new Prime Minister who is committed to not only improving the system, but ensuring the long-term stability of the program."
"Mr. Speaker, we need to do several things at once. We need to build our economy. We need to build our economy with legislation that will give us one Canadian economy instead of 13. We need to build our economy with projects of national significance. Yes, we need to negotiate with the Americans. These negotiations are taking place at a very sensitive time, but we are going to win, and so are the Edmonton Oilers."
"today, I rise to recognize Lisa Gissendaner, who retired recently as the Canton Program Director for The Ohio State University Young Scholars Program as this week's Champion of the Week for Ohio's 13th Congressional District. Throughout her career, Lisa helped and supported countless students in Canton City Schools who aspired to be the first member of their family to attend college. Through her work, she has made a lasting impact on our community, undoubtedly inspiring many more to strive for higher education. The Young Scholars Program fosters generational change by instilling a college-going culture in underserved areas, inspiring younger siblings and peers to pursue higher education. For her outstanding devotion, Lisa earned the respect and esteem of many. In the wake of her departure, I know her numerous contributions will not be forgotten. I am confident that her fine character and decisive leadership will be sorely missed. Again, I thank Lisa Gissendaner for her distinguished career serving our community and congratulate her for being this week's 13th Congressional District Champion of the Week."
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).
The hon. member for Shefford.
The hon. member.
"Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada has accepted all of the Auditor General's previous recommendations. However, our opposition colleagues are telling us the opposite. Did the Auditor General make any other recommendations in her last report?"
"I want to take a few moments to recognize Amber Moyerman on her dedicated service to the U.S. Senate. After more than 25 years in the Senate, including 18 years in my office as deputy chief of staff and administrative director, she will be retiring at the end of the month. Amber grew up in Indian Head, MD. She graduated from St. Mary's Ryken High School in Leonardtown, MD. She continued her education at the College of Southern Maryland where she earned an associate's degree. In 2000, Amber began her career on Capitol Hill as a staff assistant on the Senate Committee on Finance under the leadership of Chairman William Roth. She quickly rose through the ranks on the committee and served for many years as the deputy clerk. In2006, Amber started a new role as administrative manager for Wyoming's U.S. Senator Craig Thomas. When I was appointed to the U.S. Senate in June 2007, Amber agreed to stay on board and continue working for the people of Wyoming. As my deputy chief of staff, she has served with distinction, professionalism, and grace. Since day one, Amber has helped guide my office. She was always the first staffer to get into the office every day. Her dependability, dedication, and organizational skills made Amber an indispensable member of my team. She also routinely went above and beyond to make sure our staff had the resources they needed to succeed at work and at home. While we are all sad to see Amber go, we are all happy to know she is retiring to sunny Florida with her beloved husband Shane and daughter Alexandra. I am grateful Amber chose to dedicate her career to helping make Wyoming and our country a better place. We wish her every success as she embarks on this new adventure."
"Mr. Chair, I certainly do."
"Mr. Speaker, do members know what it is called when a company submits an invoice and accepts payment for work that was not done? It is called fraud. It is called theft. Under the Liberals, GC Strategies robbed taxpayers for millions. Will the Liberals finally take responsibility and vote with the Conservatives to get taxpayers their money back?"
"I am grateful to the shadow Foreign Secretary for the tone of her remarks. She is absolutely right to pay tribute to Fabian Picardo, the Chief Minister of Gibraltar, who has been fantastic to work with throughout this. As I said to him, nothing about Gibraltar without Gibraltar. He has been in the room every time that talks have been conducted. I am grateful to previous Foreign Secretaries for the briefing that they gave me in office. May I be clear that the military base will continue to operate as it does today? There will be zero change. It is vital for UK national security, and it is protected by this agreement. That was a red line for us throughout the negotiations. The right hon. Lady asks whether the arrangement changed with the change of government. On the red lines that were set out by the Gibraltar Government, the answer is no. The only thing that changed was that I insisted that there was a sovereignty clause, which she will see when the treaty is published. The right hon. Lady asks how quickly we will be able to share the treaty. We hope to do so as quickly as possible. She will recognise that there is a lot of technical detail. Work is ongoing with lawyers to draft the treaty, and between the European Union and Spain to ensure that the language in it is aligned, but we will get to that point as quickly as we can. The right hon. Lady asks about parliamentary scrutiny. I assure her that we will follow the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act process, as is right. Parliament will be able fully to scrutinise the treaty, and to debate the terms of the treaty if it wishes, as she would expect. The right hon. Lady asks about Schengen. As I said in the statement, this was never on the table. I give her the assurance that immigration, policing and justice in Gibraltar will remain the responsibility of the Gibraltar authorities. The right hon. Lady asks about VAT. I assure her that Gibraltar will not be applying VAT and will maintain its fiscal sovereignty. The right hon. Lady asks about the 90-day rule. Because there will, in effect, now not be checks at the land border, it is right that Gibraltarians can come and stay as long as they want. But for those who are travelling into Gibraltar from Spain, or those who are arriving in Gibraltar at the airport, I can confirm that the 90-day rule will apply across both Gibraltar and Spain. I recognise that these questions touch on the issues that dominated this House following the decision to leave the European Union, which was, of course, a decision that divided the nation. But this moment, this deal and this arrangement, for which Gibraltar was in the room, represent a conclusion to that period. I am very grateful for the tone that the Official Opposition have taken."
"Mr. Chair, prior to the minister's 2015 election, he practised business, real estate and human international rights law, but never criminal law. Is that correct?"
"I really welcome the Bill and the creation of a mechanism to increase the supply of sustainable aviation fuel. Can I add that, as we look towards airspace modernisation, we will have not only cleaner and quicker but quieter flights?"
"Mr. Chair, this falls under the minister for ESDC, but there is $87.5 billion for pension and benefits, including disability benefits."
"No, our continuous at-sea deterrent has been the policy of both governing parties for many years and that has not changed. The announcement today is about our joining the NATO nuclear mission, which carries US weapons that are already accounted for under the non-proliferation treaty. This is not about increasing the number of nuclear weapons that we hold, so it is not, therefore, a breach of the non-proliferation treaty."
"Mr. Speaker, I would remind my colleague that one of the problems that caused deadlines to be pushed back and requests to pile up is that the Liberals wasted the House's time last fall by hiding all the information about the green fund. Furthermore, on January 6, former prime minister Trudeau decided to prorogue Parliament. Because the Liberals had so much trouble managing their own affairs, deadlines have now come and gone."
"Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to what my colleague from Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles said and I know that he has been very involved in the Roxham Road file, which has become very problematic for Quebec. He has talked about people who decided to cross the border while there were already hundreds of people waiting in line who had followed all the proper steps to settle in Canada. After 10 years of laxness and chaos with regard to immigration, does my colleague think it's time to clean things up and take back control over this lost immigration which has practically turned the offices of members from all parties into branches of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada?"
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1520, the Charlotte Woodward Organ Transplant Discrimination Prevention Act led by my good friend Mrs. Cammack. She is on a roll. This legislation prohibits healthcare providers and other entities from denying an individual's access to organ transplants based solely on the basis of an individual's disability. According to the National Council on Disability, such denials are usually based on assumptions regarding the patient's quality of life and misinterpretations surrounding the ability for these individuals to comply with postoperative care. Though existing Federal laws prohibit organ transplant centers from discriminating on the basis of disability, there is limited enforcement and a lack of Federal guidance to ensure patients are protected. No one should be denied access to an organ transplant just because they have a disability. H.R. 1520 clarifies that individuals with disabilities shall not be denied an organ transplant or related services based solely on the individual's disability and includes an expedited review and enforcement mechanism through the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Civil Rights. This is a must-pass bill. We must protect individuals, our constituents, and in some cases family members, with disabilities. They should not be discriminated against. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 1520, and I reserve the balance of my time."
"Mr. Chair, if the government does not remove people from Canada, why do we have an immigration minister to begin with?"
"Order. Colleagues can see how busy the Chamber is, and will understand that not everybody will get in, but if speeches are longer than five minutes, even fewer colleagues will get in. I call Dr Beccy Cooper."
"I would like to be recognized to make some comments about the conflict we are watching unfold on our television between Iran, Israel, and now the United States. Someone asked me: What is this talk all about? I think a good title would be: ``What is this all about?'' To the American people, what is this all about? Let me tell you what it is all about. It is all about religion. A fanatical string of Shi'ism is now in charge of Iran, and they have three goals: to purify Islam--about 80 percent of Islam is Sunni; Saudi Arabia is the center of that part of the religion--to purify Islam in the image of the Ayatollah, to destroy the Jewish State, to drive us out of the Mideast because we are infidels. This is not a democracy. It is a theocracy. If you have got any time on your hands, go on the internet andcheck out the theological bases of this regime. You would understand why Israel has to get this right as well as we do. But it was not always that way. Iran is not inherently a radical group of people, a radical place. As a matter of fact, it is a very cultured place. It used to be one of the real ``Pearls of the Middle East.'' Before 1979, Iran shared intelligence, had economic ties, and military cooperation with Israel and the United States. This is from 1950, where Ben-Gurion--the first President of Israel--is talking to an Iranian diplomat in Israel. Iran had a very vibrant Jewish population. So it has not always been this way. So what happened? They had a revolution. In 1979 to 1981, there was an uprising in Iran that led to the installing of the Ayatollah as the leader of Iran, the first Ayatollah Khomeini. Now we are on the second one, Khamenei. What is this thing all about? These are students pouring over the U.S. Embassy. Our Embassy personnel--50 American hostages--were held for 444 days by these nutjobs. They were subjected to intense physical and psychological torture throughout their captivity, such as mob executions, beatings, solitary confinement, and very bad living conditions. This is what they did when they took over. They came after us, held our people hostage, and treated us very brutally. In 1984, the United States made Iran a state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law because of the way the Iranian regime, under the Ayatollah, was conducting himself. They were wreaking havoc throughout the region, and they were doing things against Israel and the United States that justified their designation in 1984 as a state sponsor of terrorism. And that has not changed. Why are they a state sponsor of terrorism? Because they are terrorists, and they support terrorists. Hezbollah--$700 million, we project, was given to Iran by Hezbollah. It is almost their entire budget. They are a terrorist group, mainly in Lebanon, of the Shia branch of the tree.  Hamas, who conducted the October 7 attack against Israel--Israel projects that 93 percent of Hamas's military budget came from Iran. We have the Houthis. All of their missiles and rockets came from Iran. We have got Shiite groups in Iraq funded by Iran. Why are they a state sponsor of terrorism? Because they sponsor terrorism all over the world, and they did it with petrodollars from the Iran nuclear deal and other sources of revenue, which was a really bad idea. That is why Trump pulled out. Here is the reporting over the period here:  Hamas-Iran alliance: Captured documents expose decades-long terror funding.  When Israel began to liberate Gaza from Hamas and drive out Hamas terrorists, they found a treasure trove of documents showing the history between Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran--suitcases stuffed with cash, U.S. flow of funds to Yemen to help the Houthis. What else have they done other than funding terrorist groups? They have threatened to kill American officials: President Trump, Brian Hook, General McKenzie, Robert O'Brien, Mike Pompeo, former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. All these people were involved in the Soleimani attack. Why did we go after Soleimani? Because he was the leader of the more radical elements of their military that had been targeting Americans and he was planning to attack our forces in Iraq and Trump took him out: in 1983, the Beirut barracks bombing, Hezbollah, supported by Iran; Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, a terrorist group supported by Iran. That is why they are terrorists. They have been coming after our interests. They have attacked our shipping in the Red Sea, the Houthis have. They couldn't fire one missile without Iranian support because that is where all their rockets come from. Some cast of characters here. The recent new President was sworn in, in Iran. During the swearing-in of the Iranian President, the crowd started chanting: ``Death to America,'' ``Death to America'' during the swearing-in of the new President not long ago, July 30, 2024. It is not quite a year ago. People wonder what they are up to. Let me tell you what they are up to. They are up to enacting a religious agenda that has no place for anybody but them. If you are a Christian, they want to destroy your faith. If you are Jewish, they want to wipe you off the planet. And if you are a Muslim and you don't agree with them, which most don't, they want to take over the entire faith and make you bend a knee to their view. These people are religious fanatics. What is this all about? Religion. Do you want any of these people to have a nuclear weapon? I don't. They are religious Nazis. Are there any telltale signs that may tell us what they are up to? Do you really have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure this out? This is a missile in Iran. In Hebrew, it says: ``Death to Israel.'' This is the freaking missile they took a photo of in Hebrew that said ``Death to Israel.'' I wonder what they want to do with that missile. If you are confused about this regime, you should not be allowed to drive because you are a danger to yourself and others. If you think this is not our conflict, you have missed a lot. You have been like asleep at the switch since 1979. You don't know anything about these people. You are talking gibberish. If you don't think this is our concern, look what they have done. They have attacked Americans. They have American blood on their hands. They are trying to build a nuclear bomb, and one of their targets is us. How do I know that? Because that is what they say. Last July, they were chanting, ``Death to America'' while they were swearing in their President. We don't do that here. Why? Because we are not crazy. These people are crazy. The Iranian people are not, but the people ruling the place are fanatical religious Nazis. If you don't think it is our concern, you really have missed a lot. You need to study before you talk. If that is not enough, the missile that says ``Death to Israel''-- let's see, when was this? Oh, 2015. ``Amid Nuke Talks, Ayatollah Says: `Death to America.' '' This is during negotiations that Obama had. In 2022, they had 95 pounds of highly enriched uranium at 60 percent. Is there a commercial purpose for uranium enriched at 60 percent? No. In 2025, 3 years later, they have 900 pounds of this stuff. So, clearly, they are not stopping their enrichment program; they are accelerating it, and they are enriching it at a level that has no commercial purpose. They actually have one reactor in Iran. The fuel for that reactor comes from Russia. They haven't taken 1 gram of their enrichment program to run the peaceful reactor they claim they want. To run a reactor, you need to enrich between 3\1/2\ and 5 percent, not 60. Weapons-grade enrichment is 90 percent; 60 to 90 is like walking across the street. If you can't figure out what they have been up to, again, you should not be allowed to drive. They are trying to build nuclear weapons. They are making material consistent with a bomb, not a peaceful nuclear powerplant. They chant ``Death to America.'' They chant ``Death to Israel.'' They kill their own people. They are the largest sponsor of terrorism on the planet. They have been that way since 1979. I wonder what they want to do. The Ayatollah's nuclear ambitions have been spread and fed for decades now. I take him seriously. Hitler wrote a book. Nobody believed he wanted to kill all the Jews. They should have. Hitler wrote a book about a master race. People should have taken him seriously. They wrote it off as just talk. They excused Hitler's provocative behavior, saying: He is just saying these things. Well, we know that didn't work out too well. Last month was the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, the Nazi regime. One of the centerpieces of the Nazi regime was to kill the Jewish people. They put the Jewish people in concentration camps, gas chambers, and they tried to extinguish an entire race of people--our Jewish brothers and sisters--killing 6 million. Just a few years ago, the Jewish people got back to the numbers before the war. Eighty years later, we are having a discussion about what should we do, as civilized people, regarding Iran. I will tell you what we should do. We should do something different than we did with Hitler--because if we do the same old thing, there goes Israel and, eventually, us.  So their nuclear ambitions are not to build peaceful nuclear powerplants and fuel them. Their enrichment program is designed to make bombs. They intend to use these bombs because they are religious fanatics. Does anybody doubt that if Adolf Hitler had a bomb, he would have used it? If you doubt that the Ayatollah would use a bomb against the State of Israel, you don't understand his religion. What drove Hitler: a sick, twisted, distorted view of the master race. These people want a master religion, not a master race. They want to dominate the world religiously. That is what they are all about. They export terrorism in the name of religion. They support groups that want to take down secular regimes. They want a master religion like the Nazis wanted a master race. And let me tell you what our friends in Israel are saying: Hell, no. Once is enough. So what should Israel do? Here is what Israel should do. They should fight back. To the American people: What would our country do if there was one missile shot into South Carolina or Alabama from a foreign power that killed our citizens? Everybody in South Carolina and Alabama would be wanting to end the terror and go after the people who did it, and it would be the entire Nation. Why should we expect Israel to tolerate what we wouldn't tolerate? There have been over 1,000 missiles shot into Israel. Since their founding, people have been trying to kill them all. Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis have one thing in common: They are all funded by Iran. All the weapons come from the Iranians. What is this all about? Killing the Jews and, eventually, us and dominating the world religiously. If you think that is weird, then you need to get on the internet and listen to what they are doing. You need to watch their behavior. And they mean what they say. And don't be like the people in the thirties that got it wrong. Israel is not going to get it wrong the second time. Donald Trump. God bless President Donald J. Trump. I am so glad he won. What has he tried to do? Make peace, not war. He gave the Ayatollah 60 days to find a peaceful settlement regarding their enrichment program. They could have nuclear power, but they can't enrich. There are 20 nations that have nuclear power that get the fuel for their reactors outside of their country. We would have done that for Iran. They were tapping him along. Then 61 days go by, and the rest is history. They are not interested in peace. They are interested in fulfilling a religious agenda that has no place for us or the State of Israel. Hitler didn't want peace. There was not a part of a country you could give him to stop him from enacting his sick and twisted agenda. He didn't want German-speaking populations. He wanted the entire world to speak German. He wanted the entire world to fall under his Nazi regime. He was nuts. And it took a bunch of people from all over the world, particularly America, to destroy the Third Reich, and about 60 million people died because we got it wrong in the thirties--6 million Jews. We are not going to let that happen again as long as I am around, the Presiding Officer, or President Trump and the people of Israel. We are not going to let that happen. We are going to stick with Israel because sticking with them is helping us. They are fighting the people that want to kill us as much as they want to kill all the Jews. Their fight, in my view, is our fight. Operation Midnight Hammer: After day 60, all the negotiations went nowhere because the Iranians didn't want them to go anywhere. President Trump acted, and it was brilliant, it was bold, and it will live in history. To all those who took part in this, God bless you. We have the finest military on Earth. We proved that yet again. But you can have the best military, and if you don't have the right Commander in Chief, nothing happens. We got the right Commander in Chief married up with the strongest military in history, which will make us safer. We are not looking to take over Iran. We are not looking to invade Iran. We are looking to make sure that the fanatics who run Iran can't hurt us and can't destroy our friends in Israel. And President Trump did something about it. He sent B-2s to Iran, and everybody thought: Well, what is that all about? Well, they missed the other B-2s that went to Iran and put a hurting on these three enrichment sites. To the pilots, to the air crews, to everybody involved: Well done. I spent 30-something years in the Air Force, and I have never been more proud. Fly, fight, win. What is next? They shot missiles at our airbase in Qatar--the Iranians did--today, about 16 or 19. One may have gotten through. I think they called us. But just remember what I said. They shot missiles at us today. They shot missiles at Israel last night.  The strikes a couple of days ago were designed to shut down the enrichment facilities used to make this weapons-grade uranium. I think we were substantially successful, and I have never been more proud of President Trump and our military. And I think we set back their military program substantially. But here is what we didn't do: We didn't change their desire for a nuclear weapon. We changed the capability to make one. Here is my goal: to have people in charge of Iran who don't want a nuclear weapon to destroy Israel, who will not be the largest state sponsor of terrorism but live in peace with their neighbors and have a good relationship with the United States. That is what I want. And if you don't want that, there is something wrong with you. How do you get that? Two ways: The religious fanatics reject their agenda; they change their behavior. Maybe that will happen. I don't know. Or you change the people and you replace the religious fanatics with people in Iran who do not want to destroy the world, who do not want to create a master religion, who want to live in peace. And I think that is the vast majority of the Iranians. If we get this right, stick with Israel, stand up to this bully--this religious, fanatical regime--let Israel do what they need to do, then I think peace is coming. The Presiding Officer and myself went to Saudi Arabia and Israel to talk about Saudi Arabia recognizing the Jewish State under certain conditions. Before the attack of October 7, we were very close to expanding the Abraham Accords to include a deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel that, basically, would end the Arab-Israeli conflict--an amazing moment in history. October 7 comes along: a vicious, brutal attack on Israel by Hamas, which is fully funded by Iran--raping women, killing children in front of their parents, and doing things that we really don't need to be talking about on the floor. That was designed to stop reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Israel because, for the Iranian fanatical regime, the worst nightmare is for the Arab world to make peace with Israel and move toward the light. These people want darkness for the world. So what do we do now? Israel has had it. I talked to the Prime Minister yesterday before I went on television, and I asked him: What would you like me to tell America, Bibi? He said: Three things. We are profoundly grateful to the American people for what you do to help the Jewish State. We couldn't be here without you. We are profoundly grateful to President Trump for his strong leadership. He also wanted me to urge the people of Iran to seize the moment to end the nightmare you have been living. And the third thing he wanted me to tell the American people is: Israel is not going to live this way anymore. They are not going to raise their children in bomb shelters. They are not going to have their life interrupted daily by ballistic missiles coming from religious Nazis who want to kill all the Jews like Hitler. They are not going to put up with that. Regime change is coming to Iran, one or two ways: The regime renounces what they have been doing since 1979 and changes course, or it is replaced. To expect Israel to do anything else is offensive to me. You are asking Israel to accept as normal being attacked every day and every night by over 500 ballistic missiles? Over 24 Israeli citizens have been killed. The missiles going into Israel are designed to kill children. The attacks by theIsraelis are designed to shut down the regime's nuclear capability. But the targets are changing. They are now going after the police force that keeps the Ayatollah in power, the intelligence services that scare people into submission, the prisons that house dissidents. Israel has made a fateful decision to go to the heart of this regime, to take these religious Nazis down one way or the other--reject Nazism and the former religion or get new people. And I am with them. I am with them to the bitter end. I am with them because being with them is in your own interest if you are an American. Being with them is in your own interest if you believe in religious tolerance. Being with Israel means you reject a regime that would take a 16-year-old girl off a bus and beat her to death because she didn't have a head cover. This is evil we are fighting. They are as evil as the Nazis. Now, 80 years later, we are having a debate about what the Jewish people should do to a group that wants to kill them all? Really? We are debating among ourselves what is too much against a regime trying to build dozens of nuclear weapons to blow people off the planet they don't like or agree with? What kind of world are we living in? To all those who want to hold Israel back, what would you do if it were our country? Would you hold us back? If you tried to, we would run you over. We are not going to live this way as Americans. So what is this all about? I am going to end where I began. It is about a fanatical regime that took over the country by force, that started out imprisoning Americans, has been trying to build nuclear bombs--multiple nuclear bombs--has been the largest state sponsor of terrorism since 1984, has American blood on its hands, has attacked Israel over and over and over again, has suppressed its own people. It is about a religious agenda. Why do they do what they do? Religious, fanatical beliefs; a master religion for the world. And if you don't believe that, you have missed a lot. That is what they want, and the only way they are not going to get there is for somebody to stop them. What did Hitler want? To take over the entire world and create a master race--anybody that didn't fit his definition of the right kind of person was in prison or killed. The Ayatollah and his henchmen have that same view, but it is religiously driven. So what happens in the next few days is going to determine the course of history for the State of Israel and the region for decades to come. To our friends in Israel: Finish the job. Do what you have to do to bring about the regime change that will allow your children to sleep through the night. To the American people: Wake up. Understand what we are fighting. The Ayatollah is not normal. These are not normal people. Stand with Israel. Standing with Israel, you are standing by your--you are helping your own self; you are helping your own families. I will make a prediction. Israel is going to win, and this regime is going to fall. This regime is going to fall of its own weight. The people in Iran are going to have their chance, as the regime gets weakened, to rise up and take back their own lives. I don't know when that day is coming, but it is coming soon. I believe that. I believe that the day of reckoning is here for the religious Nazis running Iran; that their terrorism is coming to an end; that it is going to be replaced by a region that moves together, where Sunnis and Shias and Israelis and all different groups--Christians-- work together to build economies for all those rights. We live in a time of choosing. I choose to stand up to evil. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
"Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to my colleague's speech. I have been listening to the discussion all day, and one thing that keeps coming up is the fact that Quebec did not pay this tax, so Quebec did not receive any payment. I hear my colleagues saying that their constituents need government support to buy homes and to do many of the things that are covered by bills we have introduced in the House. Can my colleague tell us whether he will support these bills and therefore answer his constituents' questions?"
"Labour Members can shout as much as they like, but we all know the truth. We used to be a strategic player on the global stage, advancing Britain's interests with confidence, and now we are on the sidelines. Over the last few weeks, historic events unfolded in the middle east, and at every stage Britain has been out of step with the US and out of the loop with Israel. Last week, the Prime Minister came back from the G7 insisting that there was nothing President Trump said that would indicate he was about to get involved in this conflict. Days later, the US launched its attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, and the Prime Minister had no idea what was going on. The week before, Israel launched an attack on Iran, and it became apparent that the UK was not even informed about the attack in advance, despite us having been involved in previous preventive action. How is that standing up on the world stage? On Tuesday, the Foreign Secretary--a lawyer--repeatedly could not say whether the US strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities were legal. This is a Government who do not know what they are doing. Let me make the Conservative position clear: Iran has been a direct threat to the UK for years, plotting terrorism on British soil. It must not get nuclear weapons. This is a time for Europe to step up, and the UK should be leading; instead, we have an Attorney General using international law to constrain and restrict the UK while the Prime Minister hovers indecisively on the sidelines. What we need is a leader--instead, we have three lawyers. Last week, I wrote to the Prime Minister about how this conflict has underscored the folly of the Government's PS30 billion Chagos surrender deal. The Diego Garcia base is of obvious strategic importance for conflicts in the middle east. [Interruption.] Labour Members are shaking their heads--they do not understand. It is obvious; Diego Garcia was used extensively during the war in Afghanistan, including by the United States. At Prime Minister's questions, the Prime Minister said that this Chagos surrender had been ""opposed by our adversaries, Russia, China and Iran"".--[Official Report, 4 June 2025; Vol. 302.] Since then, it has been widely reported that China has offered massive congratulations on the deal and conveyed that it fully supports Mauritius. Will the Prime Minister now admit that he was incorrect to state on the Floor of this House that China opposes the Chagos deal, and can he confirm whether he still views China as an adversary? Under the terms of the Prime Minister's deal, if the US were to launch an attack from the military base on Diego Garcia, we would have to inform the Chinese-allied Mauritius Government. Will he abandon the deeply flawed surrender deal? If not, when will he introduce the legislation setting out the details of the Chagos surrender, so that Parliament can consider and debate it? We welcome the announcement that the UK will be buying F-35A fighter jets, and I am pleased that the Labour party has now moved on from its previous position of not supporting NATO and advocating against the nuclear deterrent. [Interruption.] Labour Members pretend that it never happened, but we have the receipts. Conservatives are proud of exceeding the NATO baseline of 2% of GDP spent on defence, and we led NATO in getting there. However, the Government's aspiration to get spending on national security to 5% is just hope--the reality is that Labour does not have a plan to get to 3%. It is all smoke and mirrors, and we do not know what the Government will spend the extra 1.5% component on. Can the Prime Minister confirm whether this is  money we are already spending, or whether there will be any new money? So long as this plan remains unfunded, these are just words. Instead of using smoke and mirrors to inflate defence spending, Labour should heed our call to hit 3% by the end of this Parliament with a fully funded plan to get there. Look at the money the Government claim they are going to save through their welfare Bill--PS5 billion is nowhere near the tens, if not hundreds, of billions we are going to need to find if we are to meet that defence spending target. This is the problem, Mr Speaker: it is one thing to talk about spending money on planes and infrastructure and to make announcements about reviews, but it is another to be clear about where the money will come from and how it will be spent efficiently to secure the defence of our nation. [Interruption.] Labour Members can mutter all they like; we all know that they are terrified of doing anything that is even remotely difficult. It is crucial that there is a clear, united front in full support of Ukraine that secures peace on Ukraine's terms. The stakes could not be higher. We need the Government to be leveraging British influence in every way they can for Ukraine, so can the Prime Minister tell us whether he pushed for clearer language in the NATO communique about Russia being the aggressor in this conflict? Can he update us on the UK's current position on Ukraine's accession to NATO, given the absence of detail in this year's communique? We must ensure that our leading role continues, but that requires strong leadership and an ability to influence. The Prime Minister may have finally returned to this House after a fortnight away, but in truth, he is all at sea--irrelevant on the world stage and impotent in the face of rising illegal immigration. Now, with 126 of his own MPs openly undermining his authority, his Government are incapable of making even the smallest changes to bring down the cost of our ever-expanding welfare bill; there is no way that they are going to be able to pay for our defence. This is a Government who are paralysed by their own legal advice, paralysed by their rebellious Back Benchers, and paralysed by the fear of being found out for having no real vision for this country."
"The Minister can expect an autographed copy of the book by the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Alan Gemmell) to be spinning its way towards his office as we speak. I very much welcome the UK-India free trade agreement. It is good news, but Northern Ireland has a particular protocol issue. I know that the Minister is keen-- I know it for a fact, because his answers are always good--that Northern Ireland can receive the same benefits as the rest of the United Kingdom: England, Scotland and Wales. Can he assure us that we in Northern Ireland will also be benefactors?"
"Mr. Chair, the anticipation is about 179,000."
"I congratulate the hon. Member for Blyth and Ashington (Ian Lavery) on setting the scene and on his introduction of the issue. As an MP for an area that has been hard hit by the removal of 11 banks, first in rural villages and now increasingly in even the main towns of Strangford, the issue is incredibly important. We need the regulation of access to banking services in legislation and to stop the drain towards online and city-centre banking only. Millions of people in the UK still rely on cash day to day; in fact, some 1.1 million people in the UK remain unbanked and rely entirely on cash, while more than 8 million adults report that they would struggle to cope in a cashless society. A YouGov survey found that nearly 28% of small businesses use cash at least weekly. The British Retail Consortium has shown a rise in the use of cash for the second year in a row to 20% of transactions in 2023, as more and more people use cash to manage their budgets in a difficult economic environment. While closing branches, banks have managed to increase their profits by some PS2.5 billion. It is clear where their focus is. However, once the banks are closed and the profits are allocated to shareholders, how will they continue to up the profits? What services will be removed next?  The percentage of branch closures is lower in larger and medium-sized towns and highest in villages and smaller communities, at 50% and 70% respectively."
"Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a bit about the Churchill—Keewatinook Aski riding and the work we have to do to support people throughout it. This riding is three-quarters of Manitoba. It has 68 communities, 40 of which are first nations communities. There are also 20 remote isolated communities, meaning we can only get into these communities by winter road or by fly-in. The efforts being made have to take these considerations into account. When we think about the coordination that is happening across the province, across the country or even just for my riding, we have to work with all levels of government to do that. That is what we did. As soon as a state of emergency was called, one thing I did was reach out to Premier Kinew from Manitoba just to make sure our efforts were in sync and that we were listening to what was happening on the ground. I also reached out to a number of community people to make sure they were receiving supports in their communities, and I will continue to do that work until everybody is safe."
"Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member for Spadina—Harbourfront on her first remarks in this House of Commons. We share one thing in common: We are both former parliamentary interns. I welcome her to the House of Commons. I would encourage her to use her voice in this chamber. The Liberal Party has a tradition of allowing the member for Winnipeg North to disproportionately take up all the time. Therefore, I encourage her to stand so that we hear less from the member for Winnipeg North. So far, the government has tabled Bill C-2 , Bill C-3 , Bill C-4 and Bill C-5 . Today we heard from the government that it is going to spend billions upon billions of dollars more on defence. We are also facing the reality that the Liberal budget misallocated over $20 billion in its fiscal projections on what the government would be collecting on tariffs. Amidst all the uncertainty and the major defence spending commitments, why has the government not committed to tabling a budget this spring, in this session, to give Canadians clarity?"
"I am just going to make some progress, if I may. But, as I was saying, it is an either/or decision for us today: either we vote for the safe, effective, workable reform contained in this Bill, or we say that the status quo is acceptable. Over recent months, I have heard hundreds of stories from people who have lost loved ones in deeply difficult and traumatic circumstances, along with many terminally   ill people themselves. I spent some time with some of these families yesterday. They are real people with real stories and they deserve to be heard. Adil's terminally ill father took his own life by buying drugs on the dark web. It was his third attempt, and Adil found him in a truly desperate state. He and his sister will never get over that night, nor the police investigation that followed. Katie waved her mum off as she made the lonely and costly journey to Switzerland, where she had a peaceful and dignified death. But the family had no chance to say a proper goodbye and her dad made the journey home grieving and alone. Others have had to watch their loved ones die harrowing deaths despite receiving excellent end-of-life care. Warwick's wife Ann, suffering from peritoneal cancer, had the maximum dose of sedative, but it was not enough to stop the choking and suffocation, and she begged him to help her put an end to her suffering. But he did not want her last memory to be of him stood over her with a pillow. There are many, many more such stories. Perhaps most importantly, I have spoken to terminally ill people themselves. We have spent a lot of time talking about them, but not always with them. Pamela and Sophie both have terminal breast cancer, and they shared their stories yesterday. Pamela is a proud Christian who just wants to have choice when her time comes. Sophie, who is allergic to opioids, wants to ensure that her beautiful daughter has nothing but happy memories of their time together. Not supporting the Bill today is not a neutral act. It is a vote for the status quo. It fills me with despair to think that MPs could be here in another 10 years' time hearing the same stories."
"moved for leave to introduce Bill C-212, An Act to establish the Office of the Ombud for the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and to make related and consequential amendments to other Acts . Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce a private member's bill to establish an independent ombud office for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, with a mandate to examine the department's practices to ensure that they are fair, equitable, unbiased, non-racist and non-discriminatory. I thank the member for Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie for seconding the bill and for defending the values of fairness, justice and equality. New Democrats know that immigration is an exercise in nation building, but shortcomings in addressing biases, unfairness and racism at IRCC undermine this goal. If passed, the bill would create a dedicated oversight body to ensure fairness and accountability within IRCC and an ombud office that could serve as an impartial entity to address individual complaints and concerns, which is a gap in the system that every member in this House will know about. This office would also have a mandate to review concerns about differential treatment and discriminatory practices within IRCC and be empowered to look at trends and patterns to identify systemic issues. Trust in Canada's immigration system depends upon its being just, effective and equitable for all. I hope all members of this House will agree and support the bill. (Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed)"
The hon. member.
"Mr. Chair, the government committed to letting hundreds of thousands of immigrants into Canada. How many of these people will be allowed to come here without comprehensive vetting and interviews?"
"I rise today for the 19th time to call on the Trump administration to restore funding for lifesaving food aid for malnourished children. I am a father. I have a 3-year-old and 1-year-old at home, Max and Lucy. Like any parent, I want the very best for my kids. I am so lucky that I do not have to worry about whether they will be fed today or tomorrow. Yet, around the world, malnutrition and starvation is the number one cause of death for children. When a child suffers from malnutrition, it stunts their growth. Their organs shut down. For toddlers, like my 3-year-old, they can have their body weight reduced to be as low as an infant's. When they suffer from extreme malnutrition, they can't be fed traditional food anymore. In order to save their lives and to cure their malnutrition, they need this: Plumpy'Nut. It is a packet of fortified paste. They take one of these per day. After a month, they are back up to normal body weight and healthy once again. Edesia Nutrition in North Kingstown is one of two places in the country that produces Plumpy'Nut. All the ingredients, the peanuts, soybeans, sugar, and dairy, come from American farms andfactories. It is manufactured here in the United States and, until recently, was shipped around the world, reaching 400,000 children a month. Think about that, Mr. Speaker. That is 400,000 children a month whose lives were being saved--that is, until Elon Musk and the Trump administration cut off funding for this program. There is nothing woke about this. This is not waste. This is not fraud. This is nutrition for starving kids, and it needs to be restored. These production lines have been shut down. There are boxes and boxes of this stuff sitting in a warehouse in Rhode Island instead of getting to the kids who need it. What is the impact of this halt in funding? Not only does it mean that there are more kids starving around the world by the thousands, but it also means that our adversaries, particularly China, have a golden opportunity to swoop in to the rescue and build good will with nations all around the world. Mr. Speaker, foreign aid is not just charity. It serves our interests as a country, as well, when we build good will with nations that have rare earth minerals and can assist us in intelligence gathering against terrorist organizations and our other adversaries. This is part of how we build strong relationships around the world to make Americans safer. When we cut off this aid, which is a tiny, tiny fraction of the Federal budget, then it only helps our adversaries. The entire funding for this program was about $80 million a year. The Cannon House Office Building across the street is being renovated at a cost of $800 million. We are spending 10 times as much to renovate our office building as we were spending a year to save the lives of thousands and thousands of children suffering from malnutrition. What kind of priorities are those? Here is the thing: The good news is that Trump administration officials, including Secretary Rubio, have said over and over that they are going to restore funding for this program. They admit that this is not waste or fraud but that this is part of the core mission of what USAID was supposed to be. That is great. Why haven't they sent the money? What is the holdup? It has been 5 months now, and they have said over and over that they intend to restore funding for emergency food aid. They just haven't done it yet. Why not? Every day that goes by is a day that children are unnecessarily going hungry. Once again, I am going to rise in this Chamber every day until the administration keeps their word and restores funding for emergency food aid for children around the world."
(Clause 3 agreed to) Shall clause 4 carry?
"I totally agree. It has been too easy to invest in our metropolitan and city areas, so areas such as ours have missed out time and again. The fact that my hon. Friend's constituency is in the far corner of England has made it far too difficult for previous Governments and industries to think about her communities and what they need in order to be strong again. I am so delighted that we have a Labour Government who are focused on the same priorities that we all share."
"The barbarism of Benjamin Netanyahu's Government against the Palestinian people is beyond belief. We should not be negotiating trade deals with the Israeli Government, we should not have trade envoys on the ground, and we should not delay recognition of the state of Palestine. The Business and Trade Committee, backed by my hon. Friend the Members for Slough (Mr Dhesi) and for Rotherham (Sarah Champion), is determined to get to the bottom of UK arms exports. I am grateful to the Business Minister for confirming last night that he will appear before the Committee before the summer recess. Can the Minister confirm tonight that a Foreign Office Minister will be alongside him?"
"Mr. Speaker, I will caution the member opposite that there are no wrong places to build housing in Canada. We are focused on building housing across this country. We are focused on building affordable housing across this country. The reason there are new ministers here like me is for our new plan to deliver affordable housing all across Canada in communities that need it."
"I rise today to say happy birthday to the U.S. Army. On June 14, we will celebrate a remarkable milestone: the 250th birthday of the United States Army. For 2\1/2\ centuries, the Army has stood as a pillar of strength, sacrifice, and service. From the earliest days of our Nation's founding to today's complex challenges, Army soldiers have defended our freedoms, upheld our values, and protected the American people with unwavering courage. This historic anniversary reminds us of the countless sacrifices made by generations of men and women in uniform, those who have answered the call to serve, often at great personal cost. On this special occasion, we honor their legacy of dedication and resilience that continues to inspire all of us. To the brave soldiers, past and present, I thank them for their service. Happy 250th birthday, U.S. Army.  Congratulating Dr. Anjan Bose"
"Mr. Speaker, I know that all of us in the House can agree on one thing, which is that the integrity of our procurement processes is of utmost importance. It is taxpayers' money that is in question, and we take that matter very seriously. We have conducted an investigation through the office of supplier integrity and compliance. They deemed GC Strategies to be ineligible to receive any federal government contracts for seven years, and we have referred this matter to the RCMP for legal action."
"I rise today for the 14th time to demand restoration of funding for global food aid for malnourished children. It has been 1 month since I began speaking on this floor every legislative day and 4 months since this aid was frozen, when the Trump administration began. Since then, hundreds of thousands of children around the world have not been able to get the lifesaving food aid that they need because the funding has been cut off. During a normal year, Edesia Nutrition in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, produces enough of this nutritional paste to save the lives of 400,000 children in a single month. Yet, those production lines have slowed to a near halt. Warehouses are full of this product when they should be getting shipped to the children who need it. We have heard enough excuses from the administration. They keep saying that they intend to restore emergency food aid, but they have yet to actually do so. They need to act instead of just giving us hollow words."
"Madam Chair, if the minister has the will, does he not have the time, then, to prepare it?"
"Mr. Speaker, on Monday, I had the opportunity to visit the Nova Exhibition in my riding of Eglinton—Lawrence for the second time. It was my first visit alongside the member of Parliament for Toronto—St. Paul's and the Prime Minister . The exhibition commemorates the brutal massacre carried out by Hamas at the Nova music festival on October 7, 2023, which tragically claimed the lives of 1,200 Israelis and eight Canadians and had over 251 men, women and children taken hostage. The exhibition is deeply moving as it retraces the harrowing events of October 7 and highlights the resilience of those who attended the festival. Sadly, it requires heightened security, a stark reminder of the continued threats faced by the Jewish community. Just this week, the National Holocaust Monument was vandalized right here in Ottawa. We must stand united against the global rise of anti-Semitism. This exhibition stands as a timely and powerful call to confront anti-Semitism."
"I know that the hon. Gentleman's constituents will have noted, through his representations as a constituency MP, that he could not have fought harder to save that service. We devolve these sorts of decisions to ICBs, in order that they make decisions closer to the communities that they serve, with the conviction that those sorts of decisions are better taken locally than centralised in Whitehall. I understand the case that he makes, but having given ICBs a challenge, resources and freedom, we Ministers must resist the temptation to meddle every time they make decisions that they believe are right for the community, even if those decisions are controversial."
"Mr. Speaker, we currently have an outstanding plan to build a Canadian economy. First, we need to break down barriers between the provinces, which is an unique initiative that should have been done a long time ago. Second, we need a plan to ensure that Canada is a superpower, especially when it comes to energy. All the initiatives we are going to undertake will move forward with the agreement of all levels of government. Once the provinces and territories agree on a project that has been submitted, that project can move forward quickly thanks to the new bill we introduced to build one Canadian economy."
"Indeed. The hon. Lady is right in raising those points. The fact is that this scheme does not fit the requirement any longer, and I think it is, in many senses, quite brutal and inhumane. I will deal with a couple of the problems here, then I will deal with a personal case. First, the scheme is utterly slow and bureaucratic. I will say to the Minister from the start that this debate is not party political; it is very much about a scheme that we brought in and that the Government have inherited, and I hope that it can be changed."
"I am sorry to hear that the hon. Member has not had a response to his correspondence and questions. I do not have details about the Camelford bypass in my folder, but I will certainly take that up with Ministers and ensure that he gets a response."
"I am very grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way. As she knows, the leading experts in palliative care have come out to oppose the Bill, and they point to the fact that hospices are underfunded and do not have the same ability to serve patients. I therefore gently question whether we are in a position today to make a judgment that patients truly would have a choice at the end of life."
"Mr. Speaker, we hear the government announcing even more spending. Earlier this week, it announced a whopping $9 billion in spending. Now we are looking at a bill that includes incentives, tax cuts and some fairly significant tax measures. I would like to ask my colleague if she is as eager as I am to see a budget or, at the very least, an economic statement. Presenting a budget would be the least the Liberals could do."
"Diplomacy is the best way to prevent and de-escalate risk and ensure long-term security. What discussions took place on how to escalate the focus on diplomacy in the middle east in order to resolve the situation in Gaza--clearly, the architecture is not delivering at pace--as well as on the forgotten war in Sudan?"
The hon. member.
"I rise today to honor Mr. Robert Headley, for receiving the Student Organization Leader of the Year Award at Georgia Southern University.  This award is presented annually to a student who demonstrates exceptional leadership, embodies their organization's values, and positively impacts student life on campus. As president of the Interfraternity Council during the 2024-2025 academic year, he played an essential role in advancing Greek life and fostering collaboration among Greek organizations. Robert is an outstanding young man who has consistently excelled in all of the mentioned areas. I congratulate Robert on this remarkable achievement. I wish him the best in his future endeavors.  Honoring Nicholas Pappas"
"for the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation I report favorably the following nomination list which was printed in the Record on the date indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save the expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that this nomination lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of Senators."
"Before I was elected to this place, I was a member of HS2's independent panel for the community and environment fund and business and local economy fund. The Secretary of State's statement makes for pretty shocking reading. There is talk of fraud and shambolic mismanagement--things that should bring shame on everybody involved. One of the problems with HS2 was always the name, which put the focus on speed, rather than capacity. My Hazel Grove constituents use the west coast main line, and they talk to me about the capacity problems that remain. Indeed, I see them every week when I come up and down to work. The Secretary of State says that she is not reinstating the line north of Birmingham. She also says that trans-Pennine work is under way. What specific work is being undertaken by her Department on capacity on the west coast main line north of Birmingham?"
Will the Minister give way on that point.
"Mr. Speaker, once again it is so shocking, in a moment when our auto industry is under fire from the unjustified tariffs from the United States, that we have the Conservatives talking down a growing industry right in our country. We are going to stand up for our auto workers, we are going to support our auto workers and we are going to make sure Canadians have access to a growing area for vehicles. It is actually growing globally. We are going to make sure Canadians have access to zero-emission vehicles."
"On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. During Question Time today, the Secretary of State for Wales--I have endeavoured to contact her about this--accused me of unintentionally misleading the House when I raised concerns about the reclassification of the east-west Oxford to Cambridge rail line as an England and Wales project, thereby denying Wales its full share of consequential funding. She claimed that the previous classification of England-only was merely a Conservative publishing error and insisted that all heavy rail projects would now be classified in such a way--so as to deny funding to Wales. To my surprise, however, the 2025 statement of funding policy still lists the Oxford to Cambridge line as England-only. That contradicts the Secretary of State's assertion and raises questions about the accuracy of her comments in the House. What steps should I take when I have been accused of misleading the House yet Treasury documents suggest that it is the Secretary of State who has done so?"
"I want to congratulate John Foster, a Louisiana native and fellow LSU Tiger, on an impressive run on American Idol. John was the runner-up on this season of American Idol. And while it was not the outcome everyone in Louisiana was hoping for, he represented himself and Louisiana well on a national stage. John's performances were excellent and inspiring. He was also practicing and performing as he is pursuing pre-med. John, well done on pursuing both your dream and your education. From all of us back home, keep singing. You are first place in Louisiana."
"Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague on his speech. We agree in principle with a tax cut and eliminating the GST on new homes. That said, it brings the spending up to about $30 billion. The problem is that there is no budget. We do not know where that money is going to come from. Will it come from a reduction in health transfers? Is the government going to abandon the measures to compensate workers in the current context of tariff threats? Where is the money going to come from?"
"I mean, the right hon. Gentleman has only just walked in. If he wants to start heckling me, I am happy to have a discussion with him in the Tea Room afterwards, but there is no point in him heckling me from a sedentary position when he has not taken part in the debate. [Interruption.] It is very kind of the right hon. Gentleman to allow me to continue my speech. I am trying to answer questions posed by the Chairman of the Select Committee, whose debate this is. We know that NATO will--as it usually does--check each nation's spending against its expectations on a yearly basis, so that will be an obvious way in which we can see progress being made towards our goal. We will also continue to report, as ever, and I have no doubt that we will get to 3% in the next Parliament and that there will be a trajectory towards 5% overall, with the  1.5% security and resilience spending. Instead of making allegations about that commitment being smoke and mirrors, it would be better for the Opposition to say that they would do the same if they were in Government. If they did so, we would have a proper consensus to give industry certainty that this is what we are committed to do as a nation. I welcome the fact that the Liberal Democrats said that they would commit themselves to that goal. I look forward to engaging with the Chairman of the Select Committee on the recommendations in the report, and I intend to make sure he is satisfied by what we come back with. He had some particular requests about Ajax--we all know that notorious name--including when the 180 vehicles would be delivered. The initial operating capability of Ajax will be by December 2025; I am hoping it might be sooner, but as far as I am aware, that commitment is on track and at least 180 vehicles will be delivered by that time. Morpheus and the broader land environment tactical communications and information systems programme has been a troubled programme in some respects. It is a PS6.5 billion, 10-year programme. It involves lots of things fitting together, as the hon. Gentleman will recall. We are trying to make sure that the programme delivers what it is supposed to deliver. Some of the programmes we have inherited have troubled histories. That is one of the reasons why we are committed to defence reform. One of the problems with our procurement and acquisition system--this was mentioned, including by those who have perhaps experienced it in their professional life, whether in the forces or in the Department--is that it is not fit for purpose when it comes to doing things quickly and delivering what it says it will. The defence reform agenda is not about reorganising for the sake of it. That is not what we ought to be doing. Were the system in perfect order, we would not be reforming it. This reform is about ensuring that the national armaments director is accountable to Ministers and the services for delivering the equipment that the services need in a timely fashion, because that is not what happens now. Currently, each service goes off on frolics of their own. They have their equipment budgets and top-level budgets, and know what they want, and they never really talk to each other across services. As the hon. Gentleman said, a programme might get started because people think that they want the equipment, and it is a 10-year programme that is not funded right to the end, so money gets wasted. We have to do better. One way we will do better is by having much clearer accountability. The NAD is a tremendously important figure in that. We will also make sure that we shorten our acquisition timescales. We cannot just have CADMID-- concept, assessment, demonstration, manufacture, in service and disposal--for everything, with pre-contract phases and so on. We cannot do that any longer. We are not in times when we can get away with taking 10 years to produce something that is not quite what we wanted in the first place. There has been too much of that, and that is why we are segmenting our acquisition budget. The NAD will be in charge of delivering the capabilities that all our services need in much shorter timescales. As for drones and that kind of capability, we are trying to get to contract within three months. By standing up UK Defence Innovation with a ringfenced budget of  PS400 million this year, and 10% of our investment budget in future, we aim to ensure that there is the money to innovate fast and get lethality into the hands of our warfighters faster. That is essential. We need to shorten the time it takes to get there, even for nuclear submarines. Members will have seen the aspiration in the SDR to get the time to contract down from an average of six years for those kinds of things to two years. That is a challenging aim. On spiral upgrades and the new radars for our existing capabilities, we need to make sure that we get the time to contract down to a year. We need a much faster pace of innovation, change and improvement. The NAD will be responsible for that. There will be direct lines of accountability, and direct budget lines for which he is accountable. We have to ensure culture change to empower those at a lower level, so that we do not slip back into the old way of doing things. That is a challenge, but we need to meet it, given the times we are in."
"Mr. Speaker, what this government will do is pass the one Canadian economy act to get the economy going again."
"We have a really important programme of work across all arms-length bodies of the Department for Transport, including the DVSA. It is really important that we provide public services in an efficient and effective way. I am conscious that my hon. Friend's constituents and others may be very keen for rapid progress on driving test wait times. I can assure him that the issue is a focus of discussions that I am having with the DVSA."
"My hon. Friend is of course an outstanding champion for his constituents in Stoke-on-Trent North. During 2024-25, more than 800 compliance inspections were conducted at Severn Trent Water sites. The Environment Agency will be attending more minor pollution incidents and will continue to attend all serious pollution incidents. We have, of course, given Ofwat the power to ban the payment of bonuses to water bosses who damage the environment and let customers down. I congratulate my hon. Friend on supporting those tough new measures."
"My hon. Friend raises such an important point. There is a good tradition of apprenticeships in nuclear. I have seen it at Hinkley Point C and we will see it at Sizewell. I am sure, and I will make sure, that we will see it in the SMR programme as well. These are fantastic opportunities for young people and opportunities that we intend to make happen."
"Mr. Chair, I mean, the CBSA would be the department that would be able to answer questions like that."
"Mr. Speaker, a week ago, I was in Saskatoon with the Prime Minister and the provincial and territorial premiers, including the Premier of Quebec. All the provincial and territorial premiers talked about the need to build major projects across Canada, such as the Contrecœur port in Montreal. I talked about that project today with my Quebec counterpart, Minister Guilbault. We must build Canada today. We must build it together."
"I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that point. I probably will not have time to go into detail, but the amendment is not required because what my hon. Friend describes is not what the Bill is intended to do. I am very happy to speak to her outside the Chamber about that, but I reassure her that that is not its intention. On amendment 157, the Home Office regularly engages with frontline delivery partners and practitioners to understand how the antisocial behaviour powers are being used, and their effectiveness in preventing and tackling ASB. That is why the Bill includes measures to strengthen the powers available to police and local authorities. New requirements in the Bill for local agencies to provide information about ASB to the Government will further enhance our understanding of how the ASB powers are used to tackle antisocial behaviour. On amendment 158, I want to make it clear that housing injunctions and youth injunctions are not novel. They are already provided for in legislation in the form of the civil injunction, which is being split into three separate orders: the respect order, the youth injunction and the housing injunction. The youth and housing injunctions retain elements of the existing civil injunction that are not covered by the new respect orders--namely, elements relating to offenders under 18 and housing-related nuisance ASB. I also assure the House that any revisions to the ASB statutory guidance are extensively consulted on with relevant stakeholders, including frontline practitioners. The Liberal Democrat spokesperson, the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, also spoke to amendment 3, tabled by the hon. Member for Wells and Mendip Hills (Tessa Munt), which would apply the duty to report child sexual abuse to anyone working or volunteering in any capacity for religious, belief or faith groups. I know that she has had an opportunity to discuss that amendment in recent days with the Minister who has responsibility for safeguarding. Turning to the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for North West Cambridgeshire (Sam Carling), I thought it was very helpful and useful for the House to hear his experience and knowledge of the issues involving Jehovah's Witness groups, and he brought to life what it means when such reports are made. On amendment 10, the Government do not consider that it would be proportionate to provide for a criminal sanction that may inadvertently create a chilling effect on those who wish to volunteer with children or enter certain professions. We are creating a specific offence of preventing or deterring a person from complying with the duty to report, and anyone who seeks deliberately to prevent someone from fulfilling their mandatory duty to report child sexual abuse will face the full force of the law."
"Mr. Speaker, I think we are in a time of crisis. We can see that several communities have told people that they are welcome in their community. I am very proud that several first nations invited people to come and opened the doors of their communities to welcome them. I come from a nation where I have had the same experience. A number of municipalities around my nation also opened their doors to welcome people. It is truly a collaborative process to ensure that we are providing fair, quality service for people in evacuation centres. The Department of Indigenous Services is working with several partners, including the Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience and our provincial partners. One of our priorities is to improve the way we communicate. During this process, my team oversaw several discussions directly with the communities, chiefs and the people responsible for emergency processes to ensure that the way communities are evacuated in times of crisis has been clearly understood and follows a process that fosters greater respect for cultural needs and that allows evacuees to be served in their language and by their own people."
"I certainly think we should get on and do it. My hon. Friend raises an important point about whether primary legislation is needed. It is clear that the Government believe it is, and the evidence our Committee heard is that the Government are trying to find time for that. My hon. Friend makes an innovative suggestion, and I am sure the Government will listen. I think there is agreement across the House that this is important. It was the policy of the previous Government, but it was never brought forward; it is the policy of this Government, and it has never been brought forward. I think we would all agree that it is tremendously important for ratification to take place."
"I rise today to commend and celebrate the remarkable entrepreneurial spirit and culinary success of Ms. Yasmine Curtis, the visionary owner of Two Fish, a thriving and beloved food business on the Southside of Chicago. Ms. Yasmine's dedication and the flourishing of Two Fish exemplify the vital role that local, independently owned enterprises play in strengthening our communities and enriching the lives of our constituents. In the competitive landscape of the food industry, Ms. Yasmine has carved out a significant niche, building a successful business that not only serves delicious fare, but also contributes significantly to the economic and social fabric of the Southside. Her commitment to excellence has earned Two Fish a reputation for outstanding cuisine and a loyal following. The success of businesses like Two Fish is paramount to the vitality of neighborhoods across the Southside of Chicago. They create jobs, foster local pride, and provide unique culinary experiences that reflect the rich culture and diversity of the area. Ms. Yasmine's journey with Two Fish stands as an inspiring example of what can be achieved through hard work, innovation, and a deep connection to one's community. She has demonstrated how a local food business can become a cornerstone of its neighborhood, drawing people together and contributing to a vibrant local economy. Ms. Yasmine's entrepreneurial prowess and her commitment to delivering exceptional food have made Two Fish a true success story. She has not only built a profitable enterprise but has also cultivated a space that brings joy and sustenance to her patrons. It is with great honor and admiration that we acknowledge Ms. Yasmine and the outstanding achievements of Two Fish. Their success is a beacon for local entrepreneurship and a powerful example of how small businesses can make a monumental impact. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in extending our deepest congratulations to Ms. Yasmine Curtis for her outstanding contributions. May her success continue to inspire us all."
"I thank the member for the additional information for the Speaker. Again, I will take that information, and the Speaker and the clerks will come back with a decision later today. The parliamentary secretary to the government House leader is rising on a new point of order."
"I thank the hon. Gentleman for securing this debate. I have been engaging with the Oxford NHS trust, which is not yet providing givinostat to boys in Oxfordshire. Its own business case suggests that it would cost less than PS2,000 per boy and PS66,000 in total for the 35 boys. Clearly, as a country, we should be able to afford such a sum. Does he agree that a hospital that wants to be world-leading should be providing it? Does he further agree that this is exactly the sort of thing we need Government intervention on, so that these boys can get treatment as soon as possible?"
"I congratulate the Minister, and his team and officials, on all that they have done. I do not underestimate the amount of work that has been put in, especially the work with our international allies that has brought us to where we are. As the Minister can see, however, there is always a demand for more, as there should be given what we know is going on. May I add my voice to those of all who have said that hopefully this is the lead-up a successful announcement next week, with our allies, about recognition of the Palestinian state?"
"Mr. Chair, will the hon. Minister of Transport commit to bringing back Bill C-33 on rail safety and ports that was at report stage when it died on the Order Paper?"
"I recently had the privilege of visiting the cyber centre at Queen's university in Belfast, which is doing fantastic research in this area. The hon. Member is right to draw attention to the importance of subsea cables. These carry critical data between us and overseas countries every day and it is certainly part of our strategy to do everything that we can to protect our subsea cable infrastructure."
"I come to the floor this very day to correct the public record. That public record has become so distorted by fanatical allegations of Republican tyranny that it no longer records actual history. My Democratic colleagues have obscured the transcript with tales of a constitutional crisis, corrupt law enforcement, and Democratic knighthood defending the very rule of law that they abandoned for open borders not 1 year ago. Dare they pause in their breathless accusations, the historical record might reflect the consequences of Democratic leadership. It was Democrats who threw open our southern border with foolish policies that paroled over 6,000 criminals and terrorists into the United States and lost track of over 2 million known ``got-aways.'' Those same Democrats are now criticizing efforts to remove those threats. They have hurled one-sided accusations of ``masked agents acting with unnecessary force.'' This inflammatory rhetoric is a breeding ground for physical threats. As we have seen on TV, law enforcement have been pelted with rocks, assaulted with homemade explosives, and defamed and doxed by the far left. At a hearing I just held, agents told the Senate Judiciary Committee of an officer whose photograph was taken during an operation and posted on Instagram with a message that the community needed to remind him where he came from and where he was. The officer felt so threatened, he changed his appearance to protect his family. In another example, an FBI agent was threatened to back down from an investigation with photos of his children. These men and women held the line against every national security threat while Democrat Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas and Director Wray of the FBI refused to appear for their annual congressional report on threats to the homeland because they didn't want to face the tough questions they would get on why they weren't enforcing the law. Congress didn't make this Nation's laws subject to the whims of purported righteous indignation. Passionate protests don't justify laying hands on law enforcement, and bleeding hearts don't erase immigration laws critical to our national security. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
Order. Hon. members know they cannot make reference to the presence or absence of members in this place. I just ask the member to carry on without that particular piece of commentary. We have a point of order from the member for Courtenay—Alberni.
"Mr. Speaker, just one last time, I want to hear an answer to this question. Does either minister believe that oil coming from Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Ecuador or Colombia should be subject to the same rigorous emission standards as oil coming from Alberta, Saskatchewan or Newfoundland and Labrador? Please answer the question."
"I rise today to recognize the exceptional courage and service of Lieutenant Brandon Hall of Buchanan County, Virginia. On May 1st, Lieutenant Hall responded to an emergency in which a camper had filled with dangerous levels of carbon monoxide. Inside the camper were two adults and a child, all unconscious. When faced with an invisible but deadly threat, Lieutenant Hall entered the camper, removed the victims, and quickly administered critical first aid. In a moment of crisis, Lieutenant Hall was among the first to arrive, and when faced with danger, he did not pause. Lieutenant Hall's bravery and quick thinking saved these lives and stand as a testament to the selfless courage of the public servants in Virginia's Ninth Congressional District. Today, we recognize Lieutenant Hall for his swift and courageous response. The strength and skill he demonstrated in a time of emergency, reflect the very best of Southwest Virginia. We thank him for his service and are deeply grateful for his dedication."
It will not surprise my hon. Friend to hear that I agree wholeheartedly. I recognise that that was a major reason that many colleagues gave at earlier points in our discussions and deliberations.
"In 1993, my constituents Liz and Steve Fitzgerald tragically lost their daughter Claire and 11 other pupils in a school minibus accident. Together, we have been campaigning to make school minibus travel safer. The NASUWT union found that many teachers are still being pressured to drive school minibuses without the appropriate training, because of a licence exemption for schools. That exemption does not exist for private schools. Will the Leader of the House find time for the House to discuss the issue of school minibus safety?"
"I very much welcome the Secretary of State's commitment to social and affordable housing. I know that she will be concerned by the new analysis by the National Housing Federation, which finds that local authorities in England with the most severe shortage of social housing now have waiting lists exceeding 100 years for a family-sized social home. With nearly 6,000 people on the waiting list in Salford alone, will she outline what support she will give local authorities and the social housing sector to deliver desperately needed social homes?"
"Mr. Speaker, the government might like to put its head in the sand, but Canadian workers are struggling, and China is deliberately targeting them. Canadian canola, seafood and pork have all been hit with punishing tariffs, and the government is standing by while a critical infrastructure contract goes to a Chinese state enterprise. China uses trade as a weapon and detains our citizens. Is it the Liberals' economic strategy to let China take our jobs, jail Canadians and punish our exporters while Canadian industries get left out in the cold?"
"I must note that it has been nearly 3 months since the Senate passed the bipartisan District of Columbia Local Funds Act, which would undo the $1 billion cut to the local D.C. budget in the House Republican-drafted fiscal year bill. The Republican-led Senate understood immediately the cut's harms and passed the District of Columbia Local Funds Act within 4 hours of its introduction by the Republican Senator, Susan Collins, the chair on the Committee on Appropriations. The local D.C. budget consists entirely of revenue raised by D.C. It is raised by the District of Columbia, which is why the Congressional Budget Office concluded that the District of Columbia Local Funds Act would have zero effect on the Federal budget. For the prior two decades, Congress had allowed the District of Columbia to spend under its current local budget for the duration of every continuing resolution. However, the fiscal year 2025 full-year continuing resolution forced D.C. to revert to its fiscal year 2024 local budget. It did so halfway through the fiscal year. In doing so, the continuing resolution sabotaged the D.C. local budget. There was no time to respond. On March 28, President Trump called on the House to pass the District of Columbia Local Funds Act immediately. Last month, Speaker Johnson said the House had been too busy to act on the District of Columbia Local Funds Act, while it worked on the reconciliation bill. The House somehow found time to rename the Gulf of Mexico. The House passed the reconciliation bill on May 22. The House has found time this week to take up three bills to overturn the ability of the people of Washington, D.C., to govern themselves. The House is now out of excuses on the District of Columbia Local Funds Act.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the motion to recommit, and I yield back the balance of my time."
"It is very important that those who have pensions get a return, so that their pensions are beneficial. It is also important to ensure that net zero is delivered, because many people who have pensions want to see that happen. It is about getting a balance, so how will the Minister get that balance?"
"Madam Speaker, on the same point of order, in case the member was not paying attention, the parliamentary secretary talked about how Bill C-4 would eliminate the consumer carbon tax from the law. That is why he explained what Bill C-4 would do. If the member had been following the debate, I would suggest that he would see that the parliamentary secretary was, indeed, quite in order."
"I completely agree. The point is that this is about not only getting people out of poverty but growing the economy. People need access to bus routes; otherwise they are left with expensive and much more environmentally damaging private transport. Put simply, a poor or non-existent bus service is not just an inconvenience. It is a barrier to opportunity, a brake on economic growth, and an obstacle to achieving net zero. Given the decline in local bus services under the Conservatives, my party and I warmly welcome the Government's renewed focus on this issue. The Bill includes measures that are long overdue and that my party will support."
"My understanding is that we offered to brief the Chair of the Defence Committee, but I will stand corrected if that is not the case. I hear what the hon. Member says, and I think that across Government, Ministers, civil servants and everybody else must take their responsibilities to Select Committees incredibly seriously. Select Committees are a very important part of accountability to this House. I know that the Secretary of State for Defence--someone I speak to regularly--takes his responsibilities to the House incredibly seriously, and I am sure he will look forward to coming before the Committee to be questioned and scrutinised at length about the SDR and many other matters."
"Mr. Speaker, I sincerely believe that we are comparing apples and oranges here. The Quebec system is based on a cap-and-trade mechanism, not a pricing mechanism. The federal system, on the other hand, is based on a mechanism that sets a price per tonne, which sends a signal to the market and consumers to reduce their emissions. These are two completely different systems. The federal government has long recognized Quebec's leadership and, for several years, we have recognized that the Quebec system is equivalent to the federal system."
"it is a privilege to rise today to recognize Mr. Jamen Monbarren for his service at Withlacoochee River Electric Cooperative (WREC) and his remarkable role in the Light Up Navajo Project. In May, a courageous team of 16 WREC employees traveled over 1,800 miles to the remote, rugged terrains of Arizona and New Mexico, where they spent two weeks installing vital electrical infrastructure for Navajo families who have lived without power for generations. Their efforts brought light, safety, and hope to communities long overlooked, allowing children to study after dark, families to preserve food, and elders to live with greater comfort. Despite daunting challenges and limited equipment, the WREC team completed a demanding project in just eight days--far ahead of expectations--demonstrating professionalism, humility, and unwavering commitment to this life-changing mission. The impact of WREC's work goes far beyond electricity; it represents a bridge to connection, opportunity and the return of future generations to their ancestral homes. The emotional moment when power was turned on for the impacted families--bringing tears of joy and renewed hope--is a testament to the profound difference this project made. WREC's participation in the ``Light Up Navajo'' initiative reflects not only their technical expertise but also their heart and respect for the people they serve. Their dedication has energized ten homesteads and countless lives, creating a legacy of service that embodies the true spirit of cooperative values. The WREC team's journey inspires us all, proving that with compassion and teamwork, even the most daunting challenges can be overcome to light up lives and communities. I commend the entire team for their efforts on this worthwhile endeavor and for their ongoing service to our local community."
"I introduced the Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act, S. 257, with Senators Blackburn and Blunt Rochester to mitigate or prevent disruptions of critical supply chains that could have a devastating impact on the U.S. economy. The bill charges the Department of Commerce's Assistant Secretary for Industry and Analysis with promoting the stability and resilience of critical supply chains. It creates a new government-wide Supply Chain Resilience Working Group, led by the Assistant Secretary, to prepare for and respond to supply chain shocks by mapping, monitoring, and modeling U.S. supply chains for critical industries and emerging technologies in consultation with the private sector. The group will identify any gaps or vulnerabilities for critical goods, including any gaps in manufacturing, warehousing, transportation, and distribution and providing strategies to mitigate supply chain shocks. The bill calls for consultation with allies and key international partner nations to identify potential critical goods or manufacturing capacity in their countries that might be needed to avert supply chain disruptions. Finally, the bill requires ongoing reporting to inform Congress and the public, including a national strategy and review on critical supply chain resiliency and U.S. manufacturing."
"yesterday, the U.S. Senate got an update from the administration about Saturday's strike on Iran. We heard from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe, and Gen. Dan Caine, who is Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They told us, beyond a doubt, the Iran strikes were successful. Two things are clear: one, President Trump protected our country; and, two, America drew a redline on Iran--no nuclear weapons--and President Trump enforced it. Every recent President has said a nuclear Iran is unacceptable. Bill Clinton said it. George W. Bush said it. Barack Obama said it. Joe Biden said it. Even Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said back in 2015:  If there is only a 10 percent chance Iran uses a nuclear weapon, it is vital we prevent it.  That is exactly what President Trump did, and he did it effectively. For over 40 years, Iran has targeted, threatened, and terrorized the United States and our allies. We know from our own intelligence and from independent experts that Iran was dangerously close to getting nuclear weapons. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have called for diplomacy. Well, President Trump tried diplomacy for months. President Trump laid down guidelines and deadlines, and then he drew a redline. Iran used diplomatic talks to stall. It did so as it continued to race toward a nuclear weapon. As Commander in Chief, President Trump has the full authority to act. He did so consistent with article II, section 2 of the Constitution, and he did so decisively. It was a limited, powerful, and precise strike. It was aimed specifically at Iran's nuclear facilities--not at Iran's leadership, not at the Iranian people. And here is more good news: No American lives were lost--absolutely none. This was a powerful message to Iran, but not just to Iran--also to Russia, to China, to North Korea, and to anyone else who is an adversary of the United States. The message is this: America means what it says, and America will keep our people safe. Now, Democrats, of course, rushed to turn this successful strike into a political fight. Even today, they are forcing the Senate to vote this very afternoon on a resolution that says the President lacked the authority to do what he did. They have gone so far as to imply that the successful protection of the American people is an impeachable offense. Democrats are calling for the President's impeachment because of his successful attack on the Iranian nuclear program. National security should be something that unites us. But let's not forget that Democrats have said Presidents can act without a vote of Congress. They have said it many times in the past. Recall, when President Obama struck Libya in 2011, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress wasn't needed because the strike was ``limited.'' Now that there is a Republican in the White House, what we are seeing is that Democrats are suddenly trying to rewrite the rules. National security moves fast. That is why our Constitution gives the Commander in Chief real authority. President Trump seized the moment. He did it responsibly; he did it decisively; and he did it constitutionally. America and our allies are safer today because of it. And the resolution from Senator Kaine that we are voting on today I believe is not needed, and I most certainly will oppose it. If passed, it would prevent the President from protecting us in the future. I urge all of my colleagues to reject it."
"Mr. Speaker, Canadians do not need more photo ops. They need somebody to fight for them and actually get results. During the campaign, Trump endorsed the Liberal Prime Minister , and it is no wonder why. The Prime Minister said his government would collect $20 billion from U.S. tariffs. That was his big talking point, but when the pressure came, he went to his friend Trump and quietly dropped all those tariffs, leaving our steel and aluminum workers blindsided and betrayed. Will the Liberals listen to Parliament, be transparent and table a budget so that Canadians can see how much, if anything, was ever collected from the so-called elbows-up tariffs?"
"I rise today to recognize a momentous achievement by the men's volleyball team at Southern Virginia University in Buena Vista, Virginia, which has brought home the school's first-ever NCAA Division III National Championship victory. On Monday night in Salem, Virginia, the Knights defeated powerhouse Springfield College in a thrilling straight-set sweep of 25-20, 25-23, and 27-25, capping an extraordinary 35-1 season. This victory wasn't just a win on the court but the culmination of years of hard work, perseverance, and belief. Led by veteran Coach Tom Peterson, who has now guided three different programs to NCAA titles, the Knights embodied excellence in every sense. Senior outside hitter, Christian Sheaffer, named the tournament's most outstanding player, led the charge with 13 kills, while his teammates, including Kristo Bianchin, Kyler Evans, Justin Madsen, and sophomore setter Gehrig Tolman, delivered in every critical moment. From a heartbreaking quarterfinal loss last season to the national championship podium this year, this team exemplifies resilience and heart. I congratulate the Knights, Coach Peterson, and the entire SVU community. This championship belongs to all of them.  Honoring 75th Anniversary of Norfolk and Western Class J No. 611 Locomotive"
"Given the scandals we have seen in healthcare over many years, from infected blood and medicines that should not have been prescribed to what happened at Mid Staffs hospital, it is clear that having that independent, robust oversight from the chief medical officer is a good way forward if people are going to be able to trust this legislation, if it comes into law."
"The Minister has spoken many times about the importance of shifting from hospital to the community. I have visited many local pharmacies and met the chair of Community Pharmacy Nottinghamshire, seeing at first hand the important work they do to support communities in Mansfield. Does the Minister agree that community pharmacies have a key role to play in that shift and could help to take pressure off GP surgeries?"
I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.
The hon. member for Edmonton Southeast is rising on a point of order.
"Growth needs to be delivered and felt in all parts of the country, and the infrastructure strategy, changes to the Green Book and the PS1.8 billion secured for the north-east are a clear demonstration of our commitment to that. In my area, Moor Farm roundabout is blocking growth and causing misery for people locally. Does the Deputy Prime Minister agree that improving infrastructure in the north, like at Moor Farm, will show how we are investing in all parts of the country?"
"Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of anxiety in my riding, in the entire city, in fact. I ran for office not because I had a lifelong ambition to sit in this chamber, although I am truly honoured to be here, but because I believe that Canada can do better and that Windsor deserves better. We deserve policies that do not pit the environment against the economy. We deserve border infrastructure that actually serves our community. We deserve a federal government that listens before it announces something. Above all, we deserve to be seen, not just on a map, but as a force in this country's future."
"I reiterate my thanks to all members of the Bill Committee and to the Clerks and officials, who I know had plenty to be getting on with during our sittings. I am grateful for the support of my colleagues for the amendments I have tabled. The Liberal Democrats' new clause 22 on active travel, and new clause 114 on open spaces in new towns and other development corporation developments, and our amendments 88 and 89 on recreational land, form our key proposals for this part of the Bill. All of them urge the Government to go further when it comes to releasing land value for infrastructure that meets community and environmental needs. On part 5 of the Bill generally, our compulsory purchase proposals included that where major permissions of over 100 homes are not built out, greater powers to acquire that land for housing would be given to councils in a new ""use it or lose it"" planning permission. I was delighted to hear in the news that the Government are taking up that idea--although I gained a slightly different impression in Committee--even if the promise of more conditionally approved compulsory purchase orders will not give councils the same strong ""use it or lose it"" power that our amendment would have. Wary of your strictures to stay on topic, Madam Deputy Speaker, I hope you will briefly allow me to add my welcome to that of my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Max Wilkinson) of the fact that, following the introduction of his private Member's Bill, the Government, to their credit, have agreed that all new homes will be fitted with solar panels as standard--his sunshine Bill really is ""winning here""--bringing zero emissions a step closer, after all the hard work of Liberal Democrat and Labour Ministers on zero-carbon homes, before the Conservatives cancelled the programme in 2015. I turn to our amendments on compulsory purchase and development corporations. Our community-led approach is about the essential infrastructure people want to see being put in place ahead of the building of new homes. Clause 104 could support that by helping the building of council and social homes. It would reward landowners with a fair value, rather than inflated prices from an imaginary planning permission no one has ever applied for, as set out in section 14A of the Land Compensation Act 1961. Our manifesto supports that for the delivery of council houses, and we are supportive of steps that ensure that landowners are awarded fair compensation, rather than inflated prices, for specific types of development scheme. However, at my meeting with farmers in North Curry on Friday, there was concern about the idea--possibly as a result of rumours--that under the clause, farmers would lose land to Natural England so that it could carry out its environmental delivery plans, and in return would get only a reduced payment. I am not convinced that is what the clause does, but family farms have had a tough time recently. They provide food for our tables, and they have been hit hard by risky trade deals with Australia and New Zealand under the last Government, followed by a new inheritance tax on small family farms, the underspend of the agricultural budget, and the closing of the sustainable farming initiative. Given all that background, I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that the compensation proposals in clause 104, which removes hope value, will extend no more widely than the public interest categories, such as social housing, that were inserted into the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023 and into schedule 2A of the Land Compensation Act 1961 by the last Government. I am happy to write to the Minister on the detail, but in the light of the rumours that are circulating, I hope that he will give that reassurance to those running small farms in Taunton and Wellington, and across the country. I respect the experience of the shadow Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Kevin Hollinrake), in this area, so we have reviewed his proposed new clause 107, which would remove caps on the payments for compulsory purchase. However, our reading of it is that it relates not to the amounts paid for the value of the land or property being compulsorily acquired, which under law must be a fair value, but to payments made on top of the land value. Home loss payments, for example, are made, quite rightly, in addition to the property value to reflect the upset involved, but the proposed new clause would remove all caps and upper limits on how much would have to be paid for that by taxpayers. Under new clause 107, basic and occupiers' loss payments, which are made to recognise inconvenience, would be increased to the market value of the property, with the result that landowners would be paid the market value twice over for their property, under provisions intended only to recompense inconvenience. We cannot support the new clause because it would result in a reduction in the number of new social homes that it would be possible to provide, as hard-pressed councils, including town and parish councils, would have to pay so much money for these over-the-odds compulsory purchases, and taxpayers would effectively be clobbered to make sky-high extra payments to those with landed interests."
"I will just finish this point, if the hon. Lady will allow me. In addition, we are still working through a huge number of consultation responses. To prescribe a draft Bill in detail at this point would completely undermine that process and the policy work that is taking place. I would argue that not only is that bad policymaking, but it would completely disregard the input that so many respondents to the consultation have exhausted so much effort in providing."
"Mr. Chair, the Liberal government is talking about a high-speed rail project between Quebec City and Toronto. There is also the rail bypass. Which project is the minister's priority?"
"due to a flight travel delay, I could not be present for votes. My flight was originally scheduled to arrive at 4:15 p.m., ET, but due to the delay, arrived at 5:36 p.m., ET. Therefore, I could not make it to the Capitol in time for votes. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 146, and YEA on Roll Call No. 147."
"Will the Leader of the House join me in congratulating my excellent local schools in Romford and Hornchurch--Ardleigh Green infant school, Dame Tipping Church of England primary school, Hornchurch high school, Parklands primary school, Squirrels Heath junior school, St Edward's Church of England primary school, the Frances Bardsley academy for girls, and Towers infants school--for their superb Ofsted reports, both good and excellent? Will she join me in promoting, as my local schools do, more British values, more patriotism, singing the national anthem at assembly, and flying the Union Jack outside every school across our country?"
"That is a serious matter. There are poorer households, with people of all ages, that have been struggling with energy bills in recent years. I am sure that all of us across this House want to see those problems addressed. We have also seen increases in food prices over the last few years that are higher than we would like, and it is lower-income households that spend a higher proportion of their budget on essentials such as food, energy and housing. It is the policy of this Government to ensure that we are dealing with all those issues."
"Mr. Speaker, the Constitution gives the federal government jurisdiction over interprovincial trade, and that is under the purview of the minister. Has the Liberal government ever exercised federal jurisdiction in the last 10 years over interprovincial trade barriers?"
"I also rise today to recognize the Gainesville High School baseball team's historic State championship victory. In just their fourth season--they have only been a high school for 4 years--the Cardinals won their first State title, capping off the season with a 23-5 record. The championship game itself came down to the wire. With two outs and the tying run in scoring position, the Cardinals recorded the final out and sealed the win. I congratulate Gainesville High School on its historic championship- winning season and on all the hard work and hustle along the way.  Making Federal Government Cost-Efficient"
"Madam Speaker, under the previous Harper government the number of CBSA officers was reduced. We have made a commitment to increase the number of CBSA and RCMP officers by 1,000. I think it is an integral part of what will take place beyond the introduction of Bill C-2 . We will make those announcements in the coming days."
"I rise to speak in favour of this Bill. First, though, I thank the hon. Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater) for the way in which she has approached the Bill, and for having engaged with Members across the House on both sides of the argument on their various amendments. I voted in favour of the Bill on Second Reading on principle, but also because of something a constituent said to me about the status quo. She said, ""It is cruel"", and I cannot disagree with her. It was definitely cruel for my constituent Ann, who was interviewed by the police for supporting her husband in going to Dignitas. For weeks afterwards, in her grief, she faced the uncertainty of a police investigation. For me, the current system is unsatisfactory, and it was a real privilege to join others to scrutinise this Bill in Committee. It is my belief that it is stronger for having gone through that process. There is one change in particular I would like to speak to, which is the inclusion of social workers on the panel. People in that profession deal with complex, challenging, and sometimes dark family dynamics on a daily basis, and I believe that including them on the panel is the right thing to do. For those reasons, I will be supporting this Bill today, and I hope others will too."
"Mr. Speaker, this is good news for Canada, for Canadians and the Canadian Armed Forces. Yesterday, the Prime Minister announced a $9.3 billion investment in Canada's defence, which means that, in this fiscal year, we will meet NATO's 2% target. We are reinforcing Canada's role as a strong and reliable international partner in NATO while rebuilding and arming the Canadian Armed Forces."
The hon. member.
"I thank the hon. Member for expressing his solidarity, and he is right. The finding of the public inquiry that reported in September was devasting: the simple truth is that the deaths that occurred were all avoidable. I know we must respect the criminal investigation and avoid saying anything that jeopardises that process, but on behalf of our community, I simply say to our Government that until there is criminal accountability for those responsible, there will be no justice."
"Mr. Speaker, as the member wants to talk about numbers, I will go to the numbers. In 2023-24, the public debt charge percentage of nominal GDP was 1.2%. In 2023-24, it was 1.6%. Canada is in a very enviable position as a member of the G7."

What steps her Department is taking to help ensure that councils are financially stable
"My hon. Friend rightly points to the frustration of his constituents with the failed promises of the previous Conservative Government. This Labour Government--working with him, the brilliant Labour MP for his constituency--are making a difference. At the Budget last year, the Chancellor changed the fiscal rules to tax the wealthiest, and we are investing money in transport across the country, which will benefit not only those in combined authorities, but those in the broader travel-to-work region. Further announcements for towns and villages will be made next week at the spending review."
"Mr. Speaker, in short form, I do not accept the manner in which that question was phrased, but, no, I am not in support of removing the industrial carbon price. It is important for our economy and it is important for our industry's competitiveness worldwide."
"One of the recommendations in the strategic defence review was that we develop an integrated air and missile defence system in this country. We must take our homeland security more seriously than we have in the past, and that is exactly what we will do."

What assessment she has made of the potential impact of the child poverty taskforce on levels of child poverty in North Durham constituency
We are proud to be founding partners of Gavi. We have invested more than PS5 billion since 2000 helping to immunise more than 1 billion children. Gavi has enjoyed good cross-party support in this House and I am looking forward to updating the House accordingly.
"As the shadow Chief Secretary was comparing the records of our Governments earlier, I was reminded of the moment when they made all these transport announcements, and it turned out that half had been delivered already and the other half were cancelled within 24 hours. They included the Leamside line in the north-east, so I am absolutely delighted for my hon. Friend the Member for Washington and Gateshead South (Mrs Hodgson) that, after 20 years of campaigning, she has secured it, which is also great for growth generally in the north-east. As a champion for my community, I will keep banging the drum for the Weardale railway line and the West Auckland bypass. They will not be funded through this funding settlement, so my question is: will this be the only transport infrastructure spending this side of the next general election, or will there be future rounds that we can bid for?"
"Mr. Speaker, the plan was rolled out in phases, as I indicated, and it was a success, with more than four million Canadians being approved to be part of the plan and more than two million having already gone to get care. The plan, as it was presented, was effective and efficient, and people are getting the care they need."
"I congratulate the acting Chair of the Select Committee, the hon. Member for Birmingham Erdington (Paulette Hamilton), on securing this important debate and on her excellent opening speech on the risks inherent in the spending review settlement. The Conservatives left our NHS in a disgraceful state that is impacting every one of our constituents. On their watch, people with life-threatening emergencies were left waiting hours for ambulances, hospitals were left to crumble, and accessing a GP became a huge challenge. The collapse of NHS dentistry has left some people pulling out their own teeth at home. It is essential that the new Labour Government are bold and ambitious in turning the NHS and care sectors around. The Liberal Democrats support the principles of the Secretary of State's three shifts and have stated on many occasions the alternative means we would use to raise the necessary funds, but today's debate is about how the money should be spent. I was pleased that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury's statement last week incorporated a measure that the Liberal Democrats have long called for, not least in our last Opposition day debate in April: a ringfenced fund for maintenance, to deal with the huge repair backlog that has built up across the NHS estate. However, I must reiterate the need to go faster with the new hospital programme. We know that the Conservatives' plans were unfunded, but this capital spend must be brought forward so that crumbling hospitals in places like Torbay, Watford, St Helier and Stepping Hill can be rebuilt as soon as possible, because spending billions on maintaining buildings that face demolition in the next 20 years is not a wise use of taxpayers' money. The Liberal Democrats believe that the crisis in the NHS--particularly in accident and emergency--cannot be solved unless we transform social care. We have long argued that investment in the NHS will be pouring good money after bad if hospitals cannot discharge patients because there are no care workers to help them recover. The fair pay agreement for care workers is a start, but it will not touch the sides of the yawning abyss of current and forecast vacancies in the care sector. At a bare minimum, we need a higher minimum wage for care staff to stop the sector haemorrhaging workers. It is more urgent than ever that the cross-party talks for which the Government had such enthusiasm at the start of the year are reinstated. The terms of the Casey review, which leaves fundamental restructuring of the care sector to 2036, are not ambitious enough. The review needs to be completed this year, so that meaningful change is not put off while our population ages. I turn to mental health. The Darzi review outlined in stark terms the fact that mental and physical health are not given parity in the health service; mental ill health takes up 20% of the caseload and only 10% of the funds. Proper investment in mental health is essential to the shift from treatment to prevention. It was disappointing to see the Government abandon mental health waiting list targets and reduce the overall proportion of money spent on mental health, while proclaiming that they were meeting the mental health investment standard because, at integrated care board level, there had been a fractional increase. I urge the Minister to ensure that mental health is given priority, and to ensure that prevention, through early intervention, can bring about improved outcomes. Yesterday, the Secretary of State announced a new national investigation of maternity services. I was disappointed that no oral statement was made. Many MPs represent constituents whose families have been left distraught by maternity service failings at Shrewsbury and Telford, East Kent, Morecambe Bay, Nottingham, and potentially other trust areas. Those voices deserve to be heard in Parliament, but that opportunity was denied. I welcome the inquiry, but remain dismayed at the slow progress since Donna Ockenden's shocking report into the Shrewsbury and Telford hospital trust in spring 2022. She recommended 15 immediate and essential actions for national implementation; three years later, that has not happened, and the Government have removed the ringfence from funding intended to ensure safe staffing levels. Her findings were consistent with those after other maternity scandals, and the Government accepted her recommendations. It is vital that the inquiry moves the situation forward and is not used as a distraction tactic to delay real action. Before concluding, I will raise the subject of the fundamental reorganisation of the NHS, which is being undertaken without any meaningful parliamentary scrutiny. NHS England announced the decision to slash ICB running costs by 50% by the end of this year, with detailed plans to be submitted by the end of last month. No impact assessment for that drastic change was undertaken by the Department and, as far as I can see, there is no funding from the Treasury for potential redundancy costs and no confirmed redundancy scheme. ICBs will be expected to transfer some statutory duties   to other trusts without that change being on any formal statutory footing. The guidance from the soon-to-be-abolished NHS England has been hastily prepared. If ICB money can be spent more efficiently, the Secretary of State has our support, but surely such radical change requires scrutiny, particularly when it was not in the Labour manifesto and there has been no White Paper, no consultation, no legislation, and not even a short ministerial statement on the subject. We would all appreciate the opportunity to better understand how the process will improve outcomes for our constituents. The new Labour Government face an enormous challenge in turning around an NHS left at breaking point by the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats' job as an effective Opposition party is to urge the new Government to go further, faster, in tackling the issue of access to GPs and dentists, in ending the appalling scandal of corridor care and dangerous ambulance waiting times, and in bringing urgency to the issues of spiralling mental health waiting lists and the crisis in social care."
"Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister and the energy minister say there will be no pipelines without a consensus, but buzzwords do not build pipelines. How is consensus realistic when the NDP Premier of B.C. has already ruled out a new pipeline. There is currently no proponent for an eastern pipeline, and the Prime Minister himself called for Canada to be an energy superpower one day, and the next day, he insisted that half of the other reserves need to stay in the ground. Half of the PM's own cabinet wanted to see Canada's oil industries die, and they spent the past decade trying to kill it. If the Prime Minister cannot find consensus within his own cabinet, how does he plan to approve a pipeline?"
"if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous order. There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:33 p.m., adjourned until Saturday, June 28, 2025, at 2 p.m."
"All actions of the UK Government are in compliance with international humanitarian law. We want to see an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. We have fewer than five personnel from Israel on non-combat academic courses currently, but we keep all our training under review."
"last week, President Trump sent to Congress a request to rescind $9.4 billion in fiscal year 2025 and 2024 funds that a majority of Republicans and Democrats had debated and had voted for. Those appropriations were signed into law by President Trump. I want to briefly discuss the impact these rescissions would have because of the consequences for Americans, for our relationships with other governments, and for millions of people around the world. Also, I want to speak about what this does to the appropriations power and authority and responsibility of Congress. We are seeing, from my view, an abdication of article I authority that belongs under the Constitution to Congress and delegating that to the Chief Executive. It is a violation of our separation of powers, which is a pillar of the checks and balances that is essential to the well-being of our democracy. First, talking about the rescissions: The White House--as it says about everything that we do appropriate money for--the White House claims it is waste, fraud, and abuse and also claims that it contributes to the ballooning deficit. There is a contradiction here because according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the so-called Big Beautiful Bill that the President is determined to pass will add $2.4 trillion to the deficit-- $2.4 trillion. And that is before we add the increased debt service that will be required to pay it. In this country, taxpayers are now on the verge of paying a trillion dollars annually in interest payments, and that is dead money. It doesn't support our military. It doesn't support our schools. It doesn't support scientific research. It is paid to bondholders, many of whom are in China. Most of the funds that the President is proposing to cancel were approved 2\1/2\ months ago for fiscal year 2025. And there has been absolutely no showing that any of these funds--not a single dollar-- cannot or should not be used for the purposes for which they were appropriated by a bipartisan majority in Congress. There has been absolutely no showing--none--of any waste, fraud, and abuse. These funds were deemed worthy of funding 2 months ago, and the President himself agreed. He signed it. This is an end run around the article I authority of Congress: We pass a budget, and then the Executive rescinds what it is we appropriated our funds for--an enormous erosion of the responsibility of Congress under article I. But let me just mention a few specific examples of the funds that are on the chopping block: the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In the case of Vermont, it is called Vermont Public. It is our public radio station, and it is our public broadcasting. Every State has the Public Broadcasting System. In Vermont--and I know we are not unique--it is essential programming that knits together our community and provided information that was crucial, constantly, when we had floods in July of 2023 and July of 2024. Federal funding is about 10 percent of our budget, but in many States it is about 40, 50 percent. The administration is proposing to get rid of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting altogether. I totally and completely oppose that. It is the equivalent of $1.60 for each American annually. It provides a source of local news at a time when we have news deserts all around the country. The pressure on our local newspapers, on our local broadcasters, on our local radio stations is enormous. We need public broadcasting. I saw it in Vermont, as I mentioned, when we had the enormous benefit of the information we needed desperately to deal with the floods. My Republican colleagues in North Carolina had a similar experience. It was local public media markets and outlets that provided lifesaving emergency alert information to ensure that victims knew which roads they could travel, which food distribution centers were open. The elimination of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting puts all of this at risk.  Another program said to be eliminated is PEPFAR. PEPFAR is a flagship HIV/AIDS prevention program. It was started by President George W. Bush. It has saved millions of lives. It has created enormous goodwill for the United States around the entire world. The chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee has strongly opposed any rescission of PEPFAR funds, and I agree with Senator Collins and cannot, for the life of me, understand how anyone would support rescinding those funds that provide so much to so many for so little. Here are some other programs: Global Health--$500 million would be cut. These activities on Global Health protect child and maternal health. They combat HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases. We would be rescinding funds that fight malaria, Ebola, polio, HIV and AIDS, and other diseases that have been kept under control and out of the United States--in many cases, thanks to these programs--but could easily explode into full-blown epidemics.  There is $800 million being cut for refugees, like those who are fleeing genocide in Darfur and Burma. Should we turn our back on the Afghan refugee folks who served our men and women in uniform during the course of the Afghan war? Another cut is $83 million for programs that have supported democracy through organizations like the International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute, and Freedom House. These have all historically received bipartisan support and strong support. This rescission would put them out of business, even though we kept them in business by a bipartisan vote just 2\1/2\ months ago. There is a cut of $1.65 billion for the Economic Support Fund. It may not necessarily be apparent on its face, but that fund account funds our economic assistance for Jordan, which has been an incredibly important ally to kind of release pressure in the Middle East, Egypt, Indonesia, Lebanon, and other programs that combat corruption, transnational money laundering, terrorist financing, human trafficking, and wildlife trafficking. These programs also, by the way, expand and build markets for U.S. exports, creating good, high-paying jobs in the United States of America. There is a cut of $460 million for assistance for Georgia, Armenia, Macedonia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other former Soviet Republics. We want them to be our friend. We are in a contest with Russia. Walking away from these on-the-edge countries, fragile countries, would send the message that Putin wants, even while he is seeking to overtake Ukraine. There is a cut of $496 million for international disaster assistance. That, by the way, provides lifesaving aid for victims of natural and manmade disasters, from earthquakes and hurricanes to armed conflicts. This is the United States doing its share as the major power in the world to help those who have been impacted by these extreme events that cause immense harm and suffering to people, through no cause of their own. Also, it would cut $202 million for some specialized Agencies, including UNICEF that has traditionally been led by an American. And the Chinese love this because where we leave, they have made it no secret that they want to replace us. These are just a few of the examples of the irreparable harm these rescissions could cause to programs and organizations that have had longstanding bipartisan support. They serve our interests, and they promote U.S. global leadership. I understand the White House is looking everywhere it can--except the defense budget--to find revenue, and they need that revenue to offset the tax breaks that will go, by and large, to the richest Americans. But these rescissions are thoughtless, and they are reckless. Leadership of the United States is not solely a function of military power. Soft power really makes a difference, and it is a function and a power that we have to use our resources to act as a full force multiplier for democratic principles for free markets and for building alliances. If these rescissions are approved, we will be asked to explain why Congress did an about-face literally in a matter of 2\1/2\ months and ceded U.S. global engagement influence to China. None of us want that; all of us will get that. The President likes to talk about his historic mandate. He did win. It was 2 million votes out of 152 million cast. It was a small margin of victory--the smallest by a Republican Presidential candidate since the 1900s. My point here is not so much the size of the mandate. Whatever the mandate, a President should embrace the responsibility that he or she has to the entire country, and that includes folks who didn't vote for him. I do not believe even those who did were voting to risk the lives and their children's lives by cutting funds to stop the spread of Ebola or measles or West Nile virus. This wasn't a mandate to shut down programs to defend democracy where it is under assault. This was not a vote to withdraw from UNICEF. This was not a vote, necessarily, to turn our back on the world's refugees, including, in particular, Afghan refugees who saved the lives of our men and women in uniform. In the talk about wasteful spending, we are with everybody. I have yet to meet a Member of the U.S. Senate who is in favor of waste, fraud, and abuse. But we have got to identify it and then attack it, not assert the deficit justification for ending a program like PEPFAR that has proven to be efficient and effective in saving lives at very little cost. The final point I think all of us have to consider is the one I made at the beginning, and that is about the article I responsibility of Congress. Alexander Hamilton warned about the excessive power that could reside in any one branch of government and that for the well-being of our democracy, we had to maintain that competition between the branches, which required them to exercise and assert the authority that was given to each branch in the Constitution. Of course, article I gives to the Congress the power to tax and the power to spend, and it is absolutely essential that we do that carefully and wisely because our constituents are the ones who are going to pay the bill through taxes we assess, and they are the ones who are going to receive the benefits through appropriations we make. To abdicate that power, which is essentially what rescission would accommodate for the Executive, is to turn over that power to the President. And it is not just a matter of being this President; it is any President. In order for us to meet our responsibilities, we have to adhere to our constitutional responsibility under article I that we are the ones who are subject to the will of the people--in the House, every 2 years; in the Senate, every 6 years--to account for how we tax and how we spend. Let's not dodge by delegating that power to the Executive. I yield the floor."
"Mr. Speaker, I was the Conservative MP in Edmonton Griesbach from 2015 to 2021. Our team narrowly lost the 2021 election, but we won big in 2025, and it is great to be back. Politics is a team sport, and I am grateful for all the people who helped us win. The nomination campaign itself took tremendous work. My team and I knocked on doors seven days a week for a year and a half. My thanks go to some of those nomination team members, in no particular order: Paul Currie, Burt Schoeppe, Carol Kozlevcar, Stella McNeill, Cheryl McCracken, Daphne Price, Heather Markland and Leo Huang. My thanks also go to Rhoda Lupaschuk, Beenadd Sebhat, Jason Steele, Mark Hillman, Justin Thomas, Elisabeth Talbot-Jones, Peng Wu and Patrick Stewart. My thanks go to everyone who helped us win the main campaign. I thank my wife, Clare Denman, who always works on my campaigns, and a huge thanks to Edmonton Griesbach voters."
"I forgot to say this earlier, Mr Speaker: a very happy birthday from me and my constituents. I commend the Secretary of State for seeing the need to reform our energy sector, given that people across north Wales are currently paying some of the highest energy bills in the country. Will he assure me that any proposed alternative to the current energy model will not put any one nation or region at a relative disadvantage?"
"I welcome this announcement from the Government. In Stafford, Eccleshall and the villages, it means a massive 47% increase in eligibility for free school meals, but the work will not be done until all children who are eligible for free school meals are able to access them, and I have asked my local council leader to do everything they can to ensure that. I know that the Government are considering this, but does the Minister agree that councils need to be doing everything they can to ensure that all children who are eligible are able to access their free school meals?"
"As an operating department practitioner with more than 20 years of experience, I emphasise that controlling and administering drugs is already a key part of every healthcare professional's practice. Medicines   management is at the front and centre of everything we do when handling drugs. Does my hon. Friend agree that the safeguards added to this Bill, along with the existing frameworks, are more than adequate to deal with this?"
"Mr. Chair, is the minister aware that the Canada Lands Company does not just own the CN Tower and the port of Montreal but in fact is a land developer and is wholly owned by the federal government?"
"Mr. Speaker, within the legislation, we will see border control agents being able to go to a warehouse and have access to it so they can inspect. There are some very progressive measures within this legislation that border control officers are no doubt very pleased about. I think it is a holistic approach to dealing with a number of very serious issues. That is the reason why I am anticipating that, at some point, it will go to committee and we will get all sorts of presentations. If history has anything to do with it, we will see a government that is very open to ideas and thoughts in terms of how the legislation might be improved."
The hon. member for Fundy Royal.
"Mr. Chair, if $4.4 billion will be spent with no account of how many homes will be built, does the hon. minister have a problem with that?"
"Madam Chair, I absolutely agree with my colleague, and I do want to point out to the members opposite that for all of us, our job is to be partisan, but that there are times when we can work together. One of the things I was very proud of was that when Canada finally concluded CETA, our trade deal with Europe, I was able, in the House, to thank the wonderful Ed Fast, and we were able, together, to celebrate an agreement that was initiated by a Conservative government and concluded by a Liberal government to the benefit of all Canadians, and it is more valuable today than ever. Therefore, perhaps we will be able to look at free trade in Canada and the “one Canadian economy” effort in a similar non-partisan way."
I call the shadow Secretary of State.
Order. I call the Home Secretary.
"The number of health visitors in England has reached an all-time low, with just 7,000 remaining, and there is a forecast shortfall of 37,000 community nurses by 2036. The Department's own Skills England sectoral report shows that the health and social care sectors face the highest vacancy rates, at 41%. Has there been any specific assessment of how removing level 7 apprenticeship funding for those over 21 will impact the pipeline of specialist community public health nurses into critical shortage roles, and is Skills England working with the Department of Health on NHS workforce planning?"
"I thank the Chancellor for announcement of the extra funding for crumbling schools. As we know, schools across the country were left to fail under the 14 years of the previous Government. How can establishments such as Forest high school in my constituency, which is literally crumbling day by day and at serious risk of closure, access the vital funds so we can provide the service required by students in the Forest of Dean?"
"Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to join Parliament virtually to present a petition on behalf of constituents who are petitioning the Government of Canada to take action to implement a guaranteed livable income. The petitioners point out that this would be essentially a tax measure. It does not include administrative burden, as it would be relying on the social insurance number, and it would not be needs-based. The petitioners point out that savings would occur through decreased pressure on our health care system, criminal justice system and demand for social services. Reducing poverty is to the benefit of all Canadians, and the petitioners hope the Government of Canada will respond favourably to the petition."
The amendment is in order. Questions and comments. The hon. Leader of the Government in the House of Commons.
"The SNP welcomes the Bill, which will support the expanding use of sustainable aviation fuel. We view that as an important action among the range of actions that are needed to meet our legal and--most importantly --moral obligations to reduce carbon and support global efforts to tackle climate change. My constituency has already played an important role in the use of SAF, with RAF Lossiemouth being the first Air Force base to use a SAF fuel blend for routine operations, for both the Poseidon submarine hunters and the Typhoon squadrons operating with a SAF mix. The RAF has also conducted demonstrator flights with 100% SAF-fuelled aircraft, and refuelled jets in the air with SAF. Indeed, Group Captain Sarah Brewin, the station commander at RAF Lossiemouth, has stated: ""The use of sustainable aviation fuel represents a significant milestone in the RAF's journey towards helping mitigate against climate change. By integrating sustainable practices into our  operations, we are not only enhancing our ability to protect the nation and deliver excellence on operations, but also contributing to a more sustainable future for generations to come."" I welcome the fact that the RAF has some ambitious targets to reduce its aviation carbon emissions. Inverness airport, publicly owned by Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd and responsible to the Scottish Government, has offered SAF to operators since 2023--a vital piece of work towards the Scottish Government's deliberately ambitious goal of creating the world's first net zero aviation region by 2040. Offshore supply flights are one of the most promising parts of our aviation sector for SAF potential. With Scotland having the lion's share of these flights from Aberdeen airport, it is vital that we see investment in SAF production in Scotland. Aberdeen airport, operated by AGS Airports, has supplied SAF since 2022, helping offshore industries to reduce their emissions. In 2021, one of the first fully-SAF helicopter flights in the UK took off from Aberdeen airport. BP is working with Bristow Helicopters to ensure that flights to BP platforms have used a SAF blend for more than two and a half years. Scotland has an immense SAF production potential. The Bill alone is insufficient to see us reach that potential, but it is an important part of that. Scotland's SAF progress has been held back by the inaction of successive UK Governments on funding the Scottish carbon capture, usage and storage cluster. The CCUS cluster is, in turn, integral to the investment in SAF production at Grangemouth. Industry body Sustainable Aviation found that a UK SAF industry could deliver PS2.9 billion annually to the UK economy, and create more than 20,000 jobs. It is vital that, with long-overdue funding finally confirmed today--something that the SNP has campaigned on for over a decade--the full detail is rapidly made clear and that pace is further injected into the process if that overdue cash is to be converted to construction and processing. My SNP colleague and Transport Secretary in the Scottish Government has put in place an expert working group on sustainable aviation fuel to exploit the potential for the Scottish economy. I have covered our broad welcome for the Bill, but there is one area that the Government must address, which is ensuring that feedstocks are coming from sustainable sources. We welcome the Secretary of State's comments on further design work in the process and we will see that come through in the passage of the Bill. However, the Government must set out how they plan to manage the sourcing of sustainable aviation fuel feedstocks, so that the waste hierarchy is adhered to, and that existing businesses are not damaged by the introduction of the revenue certainty mechanism. The most obvious illustration of this is the potential use of high-quality wood as one potential feedstock for SAF production. Some Members, but I suspect not all, will be aware that current demand for wood will outstrip supply by 2035. It will be obvious to everyone that it takes more than 10 years to grow a forest, so there is a real and well-articulated concern from organisations such as the Wood Panel Industry Federation and the many sawmill operators throughout the UK. The UK wood panel industry currently supplies 65% of the UK's demand for wood panel products, utilising 25% of the annual roundwood harvest basket and 25% of the annual waste wood basket. Fully 10% of the UK economy utilises wood panel products and, again, it will not be lost on the Government that, in order to achieve a 1.5 million new homes target--something the SNP welcomes, given our own substantial success in social and affordable housing build in Scotland--protecting and growing wood supply will be absolutely vital. The eligibility criteria for the SAF mandate stipulates that feedstock materials must be waste that cannot be prevented, reused or recycled in accordance with the waste hierarchy. While the mandate acknowledges the waste hierarchy, which in principle would prioritise the use of waste wood for recycling before energy recovery, it is not clear how it will be monitored and enforced, leaving supplies of waste wood vulnerable to being used in SAF, against the eligibility criteria. There is a risk that the introduction of a revenue certainty mechanism will incentivise producers wishing to use this essential raw material for SAF production. There will be time during the passage of the Bill for Ministers to mitigate this risk and address this issue across the Departments involved, of which there are several. I particularly hope that the Deputy Prime Minister's responsibility for housing will help to focus ministerial and wider departmental minds on ensuring that the final iteration of the Bill supports sustainable SAF feedstocks. There are many good ways to manufacture SAF, and there are some bad ones. Let us get the mix right in this Bill."
"Mr. Speaker, again, I am going to reiterate that the reason we are here today is a decision made by a court that rendered these provisions unconstitutional. If we do absolutely nothing, it will put Canadians at risk, and it would really be a tragedy for those who have been waiting for years to have their citizenship recognized. I very much look forward to members discussing and debating this and receiving any amendments or constructive advice."
"I simply ask our Members on both sides of the aisle--I believe there will be Members on the other side of the aisle--to vote for both of these resolutions. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."
"Madam Speaker, I thank my distinguished colleague from Lac-Saint-Jean for his question. He is absolutely right to raise this point. That is basically what I was trying to highlight in my response to the first question. The Liberals are very good at making generic speeches. They say they are going to help seniors but, in their minds, that might mean a small increase to the GIS for the poorest seniors, and it would be a very small increase because that costs less. However, when we want to properly improve people's standard of living, when we want to build Quebec and Canada, we are told that $3 billion a year is far too expensive to improve the standard of living for seniors, people we should respect. At the same time, they spent $6 billion before the holidays to scrap the tax on chips. That was not too expensive. They also spent billions of dollars refunding the carbon tax, even though people had not even paid it. They pulled that off by pilfering $814 million of our money. That was not too expensive either. They choose who they are going to give the money to. I find that shocking and shameful. I hope people will realize that."
"Madam Chair, this is not a bail reform bill. This is a bill on borders."
"Mr. Chair, I will tell them we are about to make the biggest investment in tackling homelessness that Canada has ever seen, and we hope to have their support."
"Mr. Speaker, it is tragic that at a time when we are seeing a record number of overdoses, the Liberal government is taking a tough-on-crime approach, totally throwing people suffering from mental health and addictions to the side and making it a non-topic for the government. Certainly, in my riding of Winnipeg Centre, we have had a record number of people die from toxic drugs. The fact that so many people in the riding of Winnipeg Centre have been left out by the government shows it is turning its back on the people most in need of assistance."
I call the shadow Minister.
"Mr. Speaker, the government is committed to taking action on housing. That is why we have rolled out the GST break for first-time homebuyers, saving them $50,000 on up to a $1-million purchase. That is why we have rolled out a tax break for 22 million Canadians to help them afford housing. We are taking action, and we will continue to take action at a pace that I hope the members opposite will support us on."
"As with any application, there is a process that my Department will go through. We will look at any application in a fair and objective way."
"Mr. Chair, Vancouver became the least affordable housing market in North America during the minister's disastrous tenure as mayor. Why should Canadians trust him to be in charge of the housing industry nationally?"
"I rise today because I got this message from an Oregonian named Donna. She says: ``Please fight to protect Federal employee retirement benefits. They should not be slashed. Federal employees are currently putting up with so much to keep this country running. ``Immediately reducing our pay and benefits on top of everything else is a kick in the teeth. It is also a bait and switch. It should not be legal. I was promised certain benefits when I started, and they should not be taken away from me when I am less than 2 years from retirement. ``Who is going to run the government? You know, provide services that keep the planes in the sky, the power flowing, the food safe, and warn of pending major life-threatening events, events like hurricanes and infectious diseases? Who will want to work for the American people after this latest attack? Stop abusing us.'' Mr. Speaker, I challenge you to explain these cuts to Donna."
"Mr. Speaker, our colleague from Winnipeg North says that it is more important to first get things right and that it would be better to wait before coming up with a budget. I fail to understand how he can say that. I respect him enough not to believe for one second that he would hand his money over to people who would announce all sorts of spending but promise to tell him how they would finance it only in the fall. No one would do that. My colleague from Winnipeg North is smart enough to agree with me. On what basis is he able to tell us that it is fine to spend money now, that the government will try to figure out how to pay for it over the summer and that they will let us know what they came up with next year?"
"today I celebrate the storied career of Officer John Salb, who will be retiring today after proudly serving the Capitol Police for over 30 years. Officer Salb first joined the Capitol Police in 1993 when he was hired as a security aide, before being hired as a full-time officer the following year. Working in Capitol Divisions 2 and 3, Officer Salb has protected this Capitol and its millions of visitors and workers with honor. After 30 years, he likely has enough stories to fill this House Chamber. A number of those include his brother, William, as the two served together from 1994 until 2008. In 2011, John made his way down to the House Intelligence Committee, where he spent every day for the last 14 years securing our Members and staff. For over a decade, John has been a valuable asset to our intelligence team, not only providing security but also serving as the committee expert on all things Capitals and Commanders. While everyone at Intel will miss our friend, we wish him the best as he embarks on his next great journey. May John enjoy his retirement."
"I thank my hon. Friend for her work in championing those issues. We are fundamentally reforming how we assess councils' relative needs and resources, to ensure that funding is distributed to where it is needed most. That includes accounting for councils' ability to raise resources locally, which the previous Government promised to do but ultimately failed to do in balancing the numbers. Targeting funding in that way will enable councils that have had to scale back services the most to be able to catch up and to ensure that everybody, across the whole of England, is able to access decent public services."
"Have a good one, Mr Speaker! The big issues to consider in this decision-making process will be the economic and environmental impacts. As the Government develop their thinking, will they consider and report to the House on another issue? Ithaca is one of the companies seeking to benefit from the large profits from the Rosebank development. It is owned by Delek, an Israeli oil conglomerate that has been listed recently by the UN for human rights abuses in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. I do not believe that our Government would want to be associated with a company like that, and many pension funds are now divesting from that company, too. Can we have a report as the Government's thinking develops on that crucial matter?"
"Mr. Speaker, Mascouche is celebrating its 275th anniversary. This city, whose name comes from an Algonquin word meaning “bear cub”, is one of the oldest communities in Quebec. Known for its history and architectural heritage, this city has transcended time and has has reinvented itself from one century to the next. What sets it apart is the special way it blends nature and bucolic charm with a vibrant city life. This duality gives it a certain je ne sais quoi that creates a unique atmosphere. I know what I am talking about, as I have lived there for 35 years. When I think of Mascouche, I think of Jardin Moore, the equestrian trail, the walking trail on the seigneurial estate, the beautiful farmland, the Chez-Nous du Communautaire des Moulins co-operative, festivals like Grande Tribu, CHAPO, Frissons and Octenbulle, as well as the Côte à Côte theatre and the many family-friendly celebrations that make Mascouche a great place for young families. I wish the people of Mascouche a happy 275th anniversary."
The UK flour sector is really important. I very much welcome the work that that sector does for us. It is right to raise the point about trade deals. We are determined to make sure that we do nothing to undermine a very successful sector that helps keep food security at high levels in this country.
"today, we mourn the passing of a legend in Westchester County, the Honorable Eddie Mae Barnes. She was a role model for women in our area, as one of the first African-American female leaders elected to public office. She served four 4-year terms on the Greenburgh Town Board, 16 years as a voice for those who had no voice across the community, especially in the Fairview neighborhood. She was the author of the town's Police/ Community Advisory Commission, bringing residents and law enforcement closer together. She was the driving force behind naming the local community center in honor of Theodore D. Young, who did so much good for young people in Greenburgh. She was, by profession, a nurse with a BS degree from Dillard University and an M.S. degree from Teachers College at Columbia. For 32 years, she was director of nursing at Rye Hospital Center. She was a true healthcare professional. She was kind and loving. She was as tough as nails. She fought for the things she believed in, and she offered a hug to all. Eddie Mae Barnes was a wonderful friend, and we will deeply miss her."
"Mr. Chair, they are in the main estimates. It is a pass-through. It changes each year based on the value. I can get the number for this past year—"
"Mr. Speaker, I am splitting my time. Does the Minister of Finance support the construction of new Canadian pipelines?"
"Mr. Speaker, that is a backhanded compliment if I ever heard one. I can think of one internal combustion engine that my hon. colleague could maybe come help me with, and I could go help him with his, and that is the lawnmower. We will be ripping the cord on that after a long session. We will be ripping the cord on the internal combustion lawnmower and getting caught up on some household duties. I want to echo everything that my hon. colleague said and thank all the parliamentary staff, the Speaker, the clerks, all the personnel who support the table, the cafeteria, the food service staff and, of course, the PPS. I congratulate them on their 10th anniversary and echo everything said about the pages. I thank them for their service and thank them for their time here. We have been delighted to have them and wish them well as their studies progress. I also want to thank the members of the official opposition, the official opposition chief whip and the opposition House leader. I also want to thank the House leader of the Bloc Québécois and the whip of the Bloc Québécois. There is also the former whip whom I still see in the House, and I know that she is giving very good advice to her successor. I also thank the NDP and the Green Party and all their teams. There are a lot of people who support us in our respective roles, and that is very important. I want to single one person out. I am sure the opposition House leader will indulge me. I want to thank Sarah Leclair. Thank God she was there. I thank her for supporting the Liberal caucus, the Liberal government for these years. We wish her well as she relocates to another part of our great nation. Returning to the matter at hand, this afternoon we will resume debate at second reading of Bill C‑3 , an act to amend the Citizenship Act. As per our solemn promise to the people of Canada, tomorrow we will begin the debate at report stage and at third reading of Bill C‑5 , an act to enact the free trade and labour mobility in Canada act and the building Canada act, which hopefully will be delivered to Canadians in time for Canada Day, along with the income tax cut, which will benefit 22 million Canadians as of July 1. I wish a happy Canada Day to our great country and all the people who call it home."
"Mr. Speaker, I do not think it is for me to speak to any feelings anyone has, particularly the feelings I am hearing from across the way. The most important part is that we work in unity in this moment."
"Mr. Chair, I would like a simple yes or no. Is the minister aware that a passenger can be sued by an airline in Federal Court?"
"When this Government came to power, we were elected on a promise to deliver a decade of national renewal, and from day one, we have worked to fulfil that promise. Less than a year into the job, we have already started to see the results: the fastest growing economy in the G7 in the first quarter of the year, interest rates cut four times and real wages rising more in the first 10 months of our Government than they did in the first 10 years under the Conservatives. However, we are under no illusions about the challenges ahead. We will be going further and faster to turn the page on 14 years of chaos and mismanagement from the Conservative party, and to deliver the decade of national renewal that we promised. That is the backdrop against which I present this strategy to the House today. I put on record my thanks to everyone whose input has helped to shape the document, including those involved in the review I led when in opposition, which resulted in this strategy and the creation of the National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority, about which I will say more shortly. Infrastructure is key to unlocking growth across the country. Our roads, railways, airports and digital infrastructure connect people to businesses, public services and one another; our energy, water and housing infrastructures create and support communities; and our schools, hospitals, prisons and social infrastructure provide high-quality public services and help to keep us safe. But good infrastructure means improved productivity and efficiency in our economy too: increased resilience to shocks, stronger public services, more jobs and ultimately higher wages for working people. From the development of the railways to the 2012 Olympic games, we have a proud history in Britain of innovating, developing and building high-quality infrastructure, but the reality is that we have now fallen behind many of our international competitors. Too many investors now question our intentions and our capabilities. When we say we will build something, they will often ask if we will and whether we can. That is because for too long the Conservatives cut capital investment, promised major projects one minute then abandoned them the next, and left the public estate to crumble for 14 long years, from the roads we drive on to the schools we send our children to. They wasted money, time and effort, saw a decline in productivity and wages, and there was stagnant growth and an increasing belief that politics cannot change things for the better. However, with this new Labour Government, we will prove once again that change is possible. The spending review last week set out how our Government are investing in the renewal of Britain, allocating an additional PS120 billion of capital investment over the course of this Parliament, with new road and rail projects to connect our towns and city regions. That includes PS3.5 billion more for the trans-Pennine route upgrade to reduce journey times between Manchester and Leeds, benefiting communities along the train line. We are also investing in the next phase of the midlands rail hub to strengthen connections between Birmingham and the wider midlands to the south-west and Wales. In Wales, we are investing PS445 million in new rail projects in  north and south Wales over 10 years to connect cities, towns and manufacturing hubs, with two Labour Governments working together for the people of Wales. We will set out further details on our plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail in the coming weeks. This is not just about transport. We are delivering the biggest roll-out of nuclear power for half a century, with a PS30 billion commitment to our nuclear-powered future. We are providing PS39 billion for the affordable homes programme over the next decade, which is the biggest cash injection into social and affordable housing in 50 years. We are backing British industry in its pioneering work in carbon capture, usage and storage, including with support for the Acorn project, with benefits felt right across Scotland. The task before us now is to ensure that this investment is spent effectively and efficiently--a real change in approach from the Conservatives' time in government--and to plan for not only the next five years, but the long term. That is the driving force behind the 10-year infrastructure strategy. Crucially, it is our hope that this long-term approach will give investors and businesses the confidence to invest in skills and their workforce, hire more apprentices, create more jobs and improve wage rates in every part of the country. The strategy is by its nature thorough and detailed, but I will draw the attention of the House to five key elements today. First, we will provide certainty and stability through increased capital investment. We are committing to funding at least PS725 billion for infrastructure over the next decade, ensuring that infrastructure spending continues to grow in line with inflation after the current spending review period. At the spending review, we committed detailed capital spending plans for each Department until 2029-30. To provide further certainty and confidence in our plans, we are also confirming funding for the school rebuilding programme to 2035 and for the prison expansion programme to 2031. This long-term certainty needs to be translated into real jobs in every part of the country, so ahead of the summer recess we will publish a new online infrastructure pipeline. It will provide up-to-date information about what we will build and when, and where we will build it, giving industry and investors the confidence they need to invest in highly skilled jobs in every part of the country. Secondly, for the first time we are bringing economic infrastructure such as transport, energy and waste together with housing and social infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and prisons, into one overarching Government strategy. In doing so, we will expect stakeholders to think more strategically about the communities they are creating, not just the specific piece of infrastructure they are building. For example, as part of our review of the Green Book, we have decided to pilot place-based business cases, which will ensure that there is proper co-ordination between Departments when bidding for funding from the Treasury. I know that will be a huge relief for communities across the country, which have relied too often on poor planning on infrastructure and community benefit. That is the difference it makes to have Labour MPs who show up and listen and a Labour Government who get it. Thirdly, we are taking steps to address the soaring maintenance backlog in our public estate, which is estimated at more than PS49 billion. I am today announcing  a new maintenance fund to provide at least PS9 billion per year over the next decade to improve our public services and save money for the taxpayer. That includes at least PS6 billion per year to maintain and repair our hospitals, so that our loved ones can get the best possible treatment when they need it; PS600 million per year for our courts and prisons, so that justice can be served; and almost PS3 billion for our schools and colleges per year by 2035, so that every young person gets the best start in life. Fourthly, we will leverage the private capital needed to deliver this strategy. That means matching capital to individual projects and using Government debt and equity to invest alongside the private sector. We will also work with industry to explore the targeted use of new public-private partnerships where they can be shown to deliver value for money for the taxpayer. Any new model will learn lessons from the past to secure value for money into the future. Lastly, we have established the National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority. Based in the Treasury, NISTA brings oversight of infrastructure strategy and delivery together, and integrates assurance, design and delivery assessments into Treasury spending decisions. It will ensure that the strategy is implemented effectively across the whole country, including through formal reviews of progress every two years, aligned with the spending review cycle. It will also work across Government to provide expertise and support to delivery partners. By design, this 10-year infrastructure strategy is a technical policy document, and we will continue to work with businesses, investors, workers and trade unions, and local leaders to drive up ambition and improve delivery. However, the strategy is much more than that. Alongside our modern industrial strategy, it will provide certainty and confidence in Britain as an investment destination, and will establish the framework needed to deliver the step change in infrastructure investment announced by the Chancellor in last week's spending review. Done properly, it will result in tangible improvements to the fabric of our country: our local roads and high streets renewed so that communities are even better places to live; our public transport more available and more reliable, making it easier for people to get around and access opportunities; our schools, hospitals and GP surgeries fit for the future, to deliver for generations to come; and a country that will be stronger and more resilient. Communities will see the difference as this Labour Government deliver on the promise of change and a decade of national renewal. On that basis, I commend this statement to the House."
"Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if you were in the Speaker's chair when I told the House earlier today that June 12 is “Quebec Buy Local Day”. This is the first initiative of its kind in Quebec, and I want to encourage all my colleagues in the House, both the Bloc Québécois and the other political parties, to go buy a local Quebec product. Personally, I always keep a supply of rosemary-marinated eggs from Domaine du Paysan in my fridge. It is a great alternative for people who don't have the time to eat enough protein. Now, with my little advertising plug over, I have a question for my colleague. I want to know whether he really thinks that the government has taken concrete steps to seek justice in the courts against people who literally stole from and took advantage of taxpayers. Does my colleague think that the government is making every effort to catch the people who abused the system?"
That important data gives force to my argument. We are not talking not about killing people's joy but enhancing joy in their lives so that they feel safe to walk in the roads in their villages.
"The whole House will have heard that the right hon. Lady did not repeat the Chancellor's promise not to raise taxes. Britain's businesses have today been put on notice: tax rises are coming. Specifically, in the right hon. Lady's own area, despite Labour's promises to freeze council tax, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says that the spending review will mean the biggest council tax increases in a generation--a PS7 billion tax rise. Yet the Chancellor and the Prime Minister have repeatedly claimed that the Government will not raise taxes on working people. Why does the right hon. Lady think that council tax is not paid by working people?"
"Despite the majority of hereditary peers leaving the other place and the limitations post- election on the Opposition's ability to appoint new peers, the House of Lords will remain disproportionately dominated by Opposition peers. Why not tweak the Fowler recommendations, set a new limit of 500 and legislate for that in the last year of this Parliament? When that is blocked, as it will be, why not leave reform of the House of Lords to be an issue at the next general election?"
I thank the Secretary of State for his point of order and for placing that on the record.
"Since the global financial crisis, listing on the London Stock Exchange has fallen by 40%, posing a significant barrier to growth, as liquidity and investor activity decline. What steps is my right hon. Friend taking to ensure that more British businesses are listed on the London Stock Exchange and that the UK remains a leading global financial sector?"
"Mr. Speaker, on June 24, 1975, the celebrated poet of Natashquan chose the feast day of Saint-Jean, soon to become our national holiday, to bestow upon Quebeckers a priceless treasure: a song they could all call their very own. For 50 years now, whenever we celebrate a loved one's birthday around the dinner table or out at a restaurant with friends and family, we all raise our voices to sing Gilles Vigneault's lyrics featuring the name of the birthday boy or girl. Nowhere else in the world are homes filled with the sound of this extraordinary song written to celebrate Quebec, a song we now use to celebrate each and every Quebecker. Vigneault's superbly poetic words speak directly to the heart: All we have left, when all's said and done Is the time we've taken to love one another The care we have shown, the seeds we have sown Will bloom in us forever In the garden to which time has flown People, o my people, it is your turn To receive the love you've earned [ Members sang ]"
Will the Minister give an update on the work the Department is doing with the North East Mayor Kim McGuinness's child poverty reduction unit to tackle the specific drivers of that issue in our region?
"Mr. Chair, I am truly humbled and honoured to learn from my colleague. He has extensive experience with being a parliamentarian and serving Canadians. Also, I have the opportunity to work under the leadership of our Prime Minister , a prime minister who has a legacy that no one else has. It is matchless. He is the only person who was appointed as governor at the national banks of two countries. This is because of his resilience, vision and strength to build economies. He not only helped Canadians avoid a recession a decade ago but also helped the U.K. to get on its feet. We have an opportunity, and I feel pride to work alongside and under the leadership of our Prime Minister . He has the vision to build Canada strong, the vision to build one economy instead of 13, the vision to invest in our social services and the vision to deliver priorities to Canadians. He has the vision to implement strategies to utilize technology, to improve productivity and to invest more and spend less. He is working to deliver for Canadians by removing the consumer carbon tax and delivering tax breaks to 22 million Canadians, as well as investing in defence to make Canada strong. I was hopeful my colleagues would ask questions about the main estimates. I wish they could have asked questions about those."
I ask unanimous consent to begin the vote now scheduled for a later time.
"My hon. Friend raises an important point. I am working with the Minister for Energy Consumers and others across Government on this as part of the warm homes plan. We have to make sure that those who can least afford it can take advantage of the huge opportunities of insulation, solar panels and batteries."
How big could this be?
"Mr. Speaker, I do not have an answer yet. Will a real estate broker from Ontario be able to work in British Columbia by Canada Day? Yes or no?"
"I am grateful for the confirmation that the Education Secretary does accept that primary school teachers are indeed teachers, but why is she then saying that they no longer count towards her manifesto pledge to recruit 6,500 more teachers? Is it because, contrary to the Department's social media posts, teacher numbers are in fact going down, not up?"
"It is not just the House as a whole; the Defence Committee also was not given advance sight of the report. Committee members were left texting journalists over the weekend to find out what was going on. At the beginning of this Parliament, the Defence Secretary committed to the Defence Committee that he would be more open and more transparent, and reset the relationship with the Committee. Does the Leader of the House think that the Secretary of State is living up to his commitment to be more transparent, after what has happened today?"
"Mr. Chair, under the one Canadian economy act, we would get major projects built. We are interested in making Canada a conventional and renewable energy—"
"No, because I will not get any more time. Given the cost of care, people could convince themselves that elderly relatives would be better off out of the way, in order to get the younger generation on the ladder. We know from the experience of other places that once assisted dying is allowed, the scope broadens--depressed 12-year-olds in Holland can get it--and the incentive to fix palliative care will lessen. Why now, with the state of the NHS? What of Suicide Prevention Week? Yes, we know that public opinion is in favour of assisted dying, but public opinion also supports bringing back hanging."
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for South Shore—St. Margarets on her detailed speech on housing. Because I come from a rural riding, I will ask this: How is the housing strategy that our government has presented going to help rural communities meet their housing requirements?"
"This is another issue where the Conservatives can perhaps give more information to those on the Government Benches. We have real issues in many parts of rural Britain with the energy infrastructure that has to go alongside solar farms--for example, the massive mega-pylons in East Anglia. If the energy can be used onsite or if there is existing energy infrastructure, as there often is around reservoirs due to hydro and other factors, that is another great reason why floating solar is a solution that everyone can get on board with."
"I pay tribute to John Gillespie, the former chairman of Unite Scotland. He sounds like someone who did a great deal to fight for people's rights and for social justice, and a great, trusted leader for his union and the wider workforce."
"As the hon. Gentleman said, health is devolved. I am happy to write to him with the details of how we expect this private Member's Bill to be implemented by the devolved Governments. Question put and agreed to."
"I, too, thank the Foreign Secretary for advance sight of his statement. The Liberal Democrats share in the condemnation of an Iranian regime that poses an existential threat to Israel and has terrorised its own people as surely as it has citizens from other countries around the world, including the UK. That is why we support the consensus in this House that Iran can never be allowed to have nuclear weapons. Yet it is not clear that military action by Israel and the US can provide the necessary long-term lock on Iran's nuclear ambitions. Following this weekend's strikes, it was reported that Iran will work at pace to develop weapons with what remains of its enriched uranium supplies. That should give pause to those on the Conservative and Reform Benches who have breathlessly echoed President Trump's line that the strikes have been an unrivalled success. Instead of bringing security, Trump and Netanyahu's unilateral actions have increased uncertainty and the risk of a full-scale regional war. Their belief that might is right both further erodes the rules-based international order and undermines the prospects of containing Iran and other rogue states in the long term. This is not the UK's interest. That is why Liberal Democrats have called consistently for the application of robust diplomacy, supported by International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring and grounded in international law, as the only sustainable  way permanently to limit Iran's nuclear ambitions. Our immediate priority must now be to ensure the safety and support of British nationals in the region, learning the lessons of unacceptable delays on previous occasions, so why has it taken over a week since the start of strikes to begin repatriating Britons from Israel? What more is being done to support those in the wider region who want to leave? The Government have also remained silent on the legality of this conflict. Will the Foreign Secretary now commit to publishing the Attorney General's advice on whether any UK involvement in the conflict would constitute a breach of international law? Will he confirm that this House will be given a vote before any decision for the UK to enter this conflict?"
"Mr. Speaker, Peel Regional Police busted an extortion ring. Unfortunately, of the 18 arrested, almost half were on a form of judicial release at the time of arrest. Under the Liberal government, extortion cases are up by almost 400%. Bill C-381 , introduced by Conservatives, would have given law enforcement officers the tools they require to go after extortionists. When will the Liberals stand with hard-working families and their safety? Will they adopt our Conservative plan to crack down on violent extortion?"
"Mr. Chair, I said that we are working on this project. We are going to get it done safely."
"Does the hon. Member agree that no matter how many new clauses we introduce, we cannot militate against people being vulnerable, particularly financially? According to the charity Mind, 2.7 million people in this country have considered suicide because of financial hardship. How could we militate against that?"
"I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, a fellow member of the Select Committee on Defence, for giving way, and I am proud to put my name to new clause 43 in his name. I also pay tribute to him for taking forward Greg Clark's previous work in a very cross-party way for the benefit of the community. Does he share my frustration and slight bewilderment at the way in which the Government appear to be blocking commencement?"
"Residents in Wellington, in Castlemoat Place in Taunton and in Agar Grove--homebuyers--are just some of a sample who have come to me, raising the scandal of house builders not properly finishing the buildings they have created, leaving them unsafe. What steps will the Minister take to bring forward measures to ensure that house builders repair and make safe their properties urgently, without people having to wait years?"
"Thank you for that, Madam Deputy Speaker--that has given me a few more minutes. The ARAP scheme was introduced to provide a lifesaving path to safety for Afghan nationals who directly supported the UK's mission in Afghanistan. At its core, it is a moral and strategic obligation. These individuals risked their lives working for UK forces, and I believe the UK must duly protect them. The Government were right at the time to introduce the scheme, and it is important to acknowledge that it has achieved something. However, in practice, I believe the scheme has fallen dramatically short both morally and logistically. Many eligible Afghans are still stranded under Taliban rule and fearing for their lives, which highlights the failures in the scheme's execution."
"Mr. Speaker, is Canada preparing a case at the WTO to challenge the legality of China's 100% tariffs under the new international trade rules?"
"Mr. Speaker, June marks Italian Heritage Month in Canada. Today we also recognize Festa della Repubblica , Italian Republic Day, a time to celebrate the rich culture, history and enduring spirit of Italy and its people. Almost 1.6 million Italian Canadians proudly call this country home. Many came to Canada with nothing, yet through grit and hard work helped build our cities, infrastructure and our communities. In my riding of Eglinton—Lawrence, we are proud to be home to a large Italian Canadian community, with the Columbus Centre and Villa Charities at Dufferin and Lawrence standing as the cultural and social heart of the community. Italian Canadians have not only contributed to our past but also continue to shape our future through younger generations who serve Canada with dedication and passion. To all those celebrating, I say buona Festa della Repubblica and happy Italian Heritage Month."
"I always shudder a little when I am invited to do any running, jogging, boxing or whatever else people get up to--we all have our own things we like doing. Although my hon. Friend's fabulous city is a great place to be, I will not be able to join in this weekend, but I wish good luck to everybody taking part. We all live in hope that the SNP might learn some lessons from what we are doing to fix our NHS. We remain willing to work with the SNP, and with anybody who wants to serve patients and get a better service for their taxes. If the SNP wants to get in touch, it can do so, but the best thing to do is to elect a Labour Government in Scotland, which will hopefully happen soon. My hon. Friend makes an important point about mental health. We are committed, as we said in our manifesto, to 8,500 more people working in mental health, and to ensure that our schools and young people have the support they deserve."
I send a cloture motion to the desk.
"Mr. Speaker, Canadians elected this new government to double construction and to make it more affordable across the country, and that is what we are going to deliver. We are focused on delivering tax breaks on GST and income tax. We are focused on lowering development costs. We are focused on delivering for Canadians with respect to affordability across housing, and we expect the members opposite to support that."
I ask unanimous consent to waive the mandatory quorum call with respect to the O'Neill nomination.
"I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. To expand on his comment about supermarkets, in Wetherby in my constituency, Morrisons has the only cashpoints and they are outside, but they had run out of cash by Saturday lunch time"
"Mr. Speaker, this is nearly a century in a minute. I rise today with a heavy yet grateful heart to honour my didu, Mrs. Sati Rani Kaur, who passed away peacefully at 94 on January 11 in Kolkata. Predeceased by my dadu, Mr. S. C. Kaur, she leaves behind three daughters; three sons-in-law; three grandchildren, including me; and three great-grandchildren. She was my last surviving grandparent, now with my father's parents, Hirenda Lal Majumdar and Sobhya Majumdar. Didu's life was a tapestry woven through 94 years across British India and through decades of partition, liberation and decolonization. Raised in Bangladesh, she carried the resilience of a land shaped by struggle and independence. A Sanskrit scholar and educator, she taught students, including my father, in Rangoon before the turbulence of Burma's military junta, in Delhi amid India's fight for freedom and later in Kolkata, a city pulsing with a cultural rebirth. Her strong will and Hindu heart defined her. She lived life on her own terms. Om Shanti ."
"Mr. Speaker, that has been one of the challenges we have seen over the last number of years. I can assure all the new people who are joining us in the House that it has been years during which the Liberal Party has talked about its plans, its communications and all these grandiose things it is going to do, yet it never delivers. I have to laugh when I hear new members come into the House to say they have to fix this problem. They are right. It is the problem you guys created, so thanks for showing up to give us a hand. We appreciate that—"
"Mr. Speaker, just about everything the member said in her intervention is wrong. Bill C-11 ensures that Canadian artists get rewarded, as they should, by online platforms. Bill C-11 makes sure that Canadian content can be discovered by Canadians, by my kids, by all of our kids, instead of just international artists. That is exactly what Bill C-11 does. It gives the opportunity for Canadians to discover Canadian artists, something we should all support."
"(Consideration in committee of the whole of all votes in the main estimates, Alexandra Mendès in the chair)"
"Yes; as I set out my statement, we intend to co-produce the Timms review with disabled people, the organisations that represent them, other experts  and MPs, so my hon. Friend's constituents will absolutely be able to feed their views into the review. We want to strike the right balance here, because co-production takes time. We want to do it as quickly as possible, but it has to be done as effectively as possible. I look forward to working with my hon. Friend and involving her constituents' views."
"I do not know where Scottish Labour MPs have been for the past six months, but the Scottish Government have already made it abundantly clear that we will reintroduce a winter fuel payment--and we would have done that with or without this embarrassing, screeching U-turn. Here is another place where the Minister can follow the Scottish Government: the two-child benefit cap. We vowed to ensure that it will disappear in Scotland. Will he now make the same pledge across the UK?"
I call the shadow Foreign Secretary.
"Mr. Speaker, I am the first to recognize that it is extremely important that the federal and provincial governments be able to agree on how to properly fund social programs. One example is the Canadian dental care plan. This program was implemented fairly quickly and very effectively, and it has yielded good results. As for pharmacare, discussions are still ongoing, as far as I know. If an agreement can be reached, so much the better."
"I would like to express my appreciation to all those who have worked on the legislation to develop and shape the policies,  whether they be the majority developed under the previous Conservative Government or members of the Bill team, who I am sure have provided helpful assistance to Ministers. As I am sure we will hear today, some of the measures in the Bill are the result of amazing people who have suffered the worst experiences, but who have worked to ensure that others do not have to suffer them in future. In addition, considering the context of the legislation, it is right to pay tribute to the excellent work of police officers across the country. Week in, week out, those serving in our police forces put themselves in harm's way to keep our streets safe. Those who serve and place themselves in danger cannot be thanked enough. Many people ask themselves whether they would have the bravery to stand up and intervene. Officers across the country do so on a daily basis. Thanks to the efforts of the previous Conservative Government, the police force numbered over 149,000 officers in 2024, with 149,769 recorded in March 2024. This was the highest number of officers, on both full-time equivalent and headcount basis, since comparable records began in March 2003."
"international trade is critical to the resilience and functioning of global supply chains, with goods and services--including industrial inputs and manufacturing equipment being imported and exported along the way. The trade policies and trade actions of the U.S. Government impact the structure, operation, efficiency, and security of U.S. supply chains, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) plays a key role in developing and coordinating the implementation of those trade policies and actions. USTR can provide valuable input to the Supply Chain Resilience Working Group, and the committees with jurisdiction over trade--the Senate Committee on Finance and House Committee on Ways and Means--can likewise provide valuable oversight. I look forward to working with my colleagues who sponsor this bill to bring those trade interests into the fold. In addition, I look forward to working to clarify the definition of ``ally or key international partner nation'' to ensure that this bill will focus on supporting more secure and resilient supply chains in the United States and reliable partner nations, while limiting our critical supply chains' exposure to foreign countries that may not be aligned with the economic or security interests of the United States. I thank my colleague Senator Cantwell for her work on this bill and her willingness to work with me on these issues."
What steps his Department is taking to tackle building maintenance backlogs in the NHS estate.
Will the hon. Member give way?
"The hon. Lady is right that the people of Gibraltar have been in limbo since the Brexit decision, which is why it was important that, in coming into  office and inheriting this from the last Government, we put every effort into it. Let me again pay tribute to the Minister for Europe who rolled up his sleeves and was a sherpa at a lot of those meetings, particularly over the last year. The hon. Lady asked about business. I assure her that I was with representatives from the business sector in Gibraltar yesterday morning discussing what a deal would mean for them if it were reached later in the afternoon. There was one word that they kept coming back to: certainty. They wanted certainty, and they wanted the opportunity of a more frictionless border arrangement with Spain and the opportunity to sell into the Spanish market unhindered. That is what they said and that is what we particularly took on board. The hon. Lady rightly asked about any ability to thwart the deal that might exist in parts of the Spanish parliamentary system. May I remind her that the deal, appropriately, is between the United Kingdom and the European Union, that we have always been a country that meets our treaty obligations seriously and that whatever one's views about the European Union, it is also an organisation that meets its obligations seriously? When we sign up to a treaty, that is what we are doing. As with the trade and co-operation agreement, there is a review mechanism that would allow the appropriate review; indeed, the UK-EU summit that we had a few weeks ago was an appropriate review. However, we met our obligations under the TCA in opposition, standing up for the agreement that had been struck by the last Government, and we would expect the same in this instance."
"Mr. Speaker, this is not my first rodeo, so to speak, in this place, so it is great to have this slot with all the members here. I know my Conservative colleagues in particular enjoy when I get up for debate. They will be champing at the bit to ask questions afterward. I am not our hon. colleague from Winnipeg North , so they have a fresh opportunity to engage with this side, although we do love our hon. colleague from Winnipeg North. It is a pleasure to join this opposition day debate. Any member who knows me in this House knows that I enjoy the opportunity to litigate the text of motions and the ideas that the opposition puts forward in this place, and I intend to do that this afternoon, even if it is after question period and Statements by Members. I have had the opportunity to review the principal elements of this motion, and I look forward to speaking to those points and to some ancillary points that will be important for all members to think about in the days ahead regarding the way this government is advancing its agenda. I want to start, from the hop, by talking about the fact that we are in week three of Parliament and this government is moving on significant issues of importance, including having one Canadian economy, defence spending up to 2% of our NATO target, working to make sure big projects get done and engagement on the international stage with the G7. This Parliament and this government are working, and I look forward to my opposition colleagues joining the efforts of what this government is trying to get accomplished. It is clear from public opinion and clear from the election results on April 28 that Canadians like what they are seeing from this Prime Minister , his government and the leadership regarding what we are trying to get accomplished with this new government, moving forward. The Conservative motion speaks to a company called GC Strategies. This was a two-person firm, an IT contractor. Canadians who have been watching the debate and the way that members have engaged may not recognize that the government, from day one of the Auditor General's report, has wanted to work to implement the what is in the reports. There was an absolute failure of procurement at the civil service level. It is important to separate those two things, because when we hear the way Conservative members in this place raise this issue, and we agree that it is an important issue to be raised, we hear the suggestion in their language that Liberal ministers themselves were involved in this. No, this was a failure of procurement at the civil service level. I know there are some new members to this House, particularly on the other side. It is important to separate our Westminster tradition into the elected element of government versus the civil servants who do the work on behalf of government. Yes, there is ministerial accountability, and the ministers of the former Liberal government have engaged and worked to move forward, but at the end of the day, there is a separation. I would caution Conservative colleagues, when they stand in this place, to separate the difference, because they make clips of these things and send them home to their constituents, and Canadians who are not watching closely would be led to believe from the comments of the members on the opposite side that ministers themselves were absolutely involved with what we on the government side suggest was a failure of procurement. That is a difference. That is about our level of engagement. It is a responsibility of every parliamentarian in this House to show a level of nuance, not to clip things, send them home and suggest that Liberal members or ministers are corrupt. That is dangerous language. That is not the way we should move forward. After we go to members' statements, I look forward to continuing to litigate this argument because it is important. I look forward to talking about the ways the government is addressing the concerns the opposition is raising and how we will have a process to get the money back for taxpayers."
"Madam Chair, that is not what I asked. I asked if the minister is okay with the fact that Bernardo is in medium security, yes or no."
"Madam Chair, I know the member is eager to present it to her constituents and have her constituents look at this great budget, but she will have to wait just a bit longer. It is going to be great, and she is going to be proud of the budget."
I reserve the balance of my time.
"Mr. Speaker, I am simply inviting my colleague to read the document carefully, because the goal is to give our police forces more resources and to facilitate their work and operations. I would also invite her to look at how this bill can be managed in a much more integrated way, rather than seeing it from a silo perspective or from the point of view of a single framework. That is the problem with the opposition. When work is done, when we take action or table bills, the opposition says that it is not enough. When we put forward a more comprehensive and integrated plan, it says that we are going too far. At some point, we really have to take a stand. I think that this bill will give our police forces all the resources they need. We will truly be adopting a more proactive and preventive approach, and I think that our streets will be much safer as a result. I sincerely invite our colleagues to collaborate and to start by reading the bill."
"I rise today to honor an extraordinary milestone--the 50th anniversary of Grand Valley State University's long-standing partnership with the Krakow University of Economics in Poland. For five decades, these two institutions have stood as a shining example of the power and promise of international collaboration in higher education, and I could not be prouder of the great work they have achieved together.  GVSU is a pillar of our community. Year after year, their commitment to academic excellence and innovation has led generations of students to reach their full potential. With a dedication to fostering global understanding, GVSU has always known the importance of offering students opportunities that extend beyond our borders, and they have worked tirelessly to connect their students with experiences that broaden their global understanding. This is why their partnership with the Krakow University of Economics is so meaningful--a true testament to their mission. This partnership began in 1975, at a time when the United States and Poland shared more differences than they did similarities. Still, they came together with a mission to educate, building a strong connection based on mutual respect and a shared goal of helping students grow through global learning. Over the course of 50 years, their partnership has helped foster not only academic excellence, but cultural exchange and understanding between our two nations. As our world becomes more interconnected than ever, this partnership continues to serve as a shining example of what can be achieved when we come together to learn and grow from each other. On behalf of Michigan's Third Congressional District, congratulations to those at both Grand Valley State University and the Krakow University of Economics who have maintained this collaboration over the years. This partnership has touched the lives of countless students, faculty, and communities across the globe. Today and every day, we thank both institutions for their lasting impact on the communities they serve."
"I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from the great State of Connecticut for yielding and for her tremendous leadership in pushing back against this reckless Republican rescissions package. It is extraordinary to me that, once again, we are on the floor of the House of Representatives not debating legislation that Republicans bring forward, Mr. Speaker, that is designed to lower the high cost of living in the United States of America, a promise that Republicans repeatedly made last year to the American people and now have repeatedly broken. Throughout this Congress, not a single bill has been brought to the House floor by my Republican colleagues that addresses the high cost of living in the United States of America--not a single bill.  House Republicans and President Trump promised that costs were going to go down in the United States of America. In fact, the majority has said that costs were going to go down on day one. Yet, we know that costs haven't gone down in this great country, Mr. Speaker. Costs have gone up. America is too expensive. Housing costs are too high. Grocery costs are too high. Utility costs are too high. Childcare costs are too high. Insurance costs are too high. America is too expensive. Republicans have decided that, in the face of this affordability crisis in the United States of America, the majority is going to undermine America's ability to protect our national security through the exercise of soft power and addressing in a bipartisan way the HIV and AIDS epidemic, a program that was first put into place by President George W. Bush and has saved the lives of millions of people across the world and, of course, people here at home by fighting against this epidemic. America is made safer when we are able to invest in diplomacy, development, and democracy across the world, particularly in the face of aggressive efforts by China, Russia, and other malignant actors to move the world in a different place. Mr. Speaker, this reckless Republican rescissions package will undermine America's national security and undermine public health here in this country and across the world. It actually represents an attack on children. This is extraordinary to me. We are on the floor of the House of Representatives not debating legislation that is designed to make this country and our economy more affordable but actually debating legislation that targets Elmo, Big Bird, Daniel Tiger, and ``Sesame Street.'' That is what we are doing by going after public broadcasting in the United States of America. ``Sesame Street'' has a letter of the day. I believe the letter of the day today is C. How appropriate because this Republican bill is cruel, and it cuts children's programming all across the country. How can this be that Republicans' priority right now does nothing on the economy, nothing to make life more affordable, and nothing to address the high cost of living? Instead, Republicans are attacking Elmo, ``Sesame Street,'' Big Bird, and Daniel Tiger. Republicans' priorities are all wrong. This is on top of a GOP tax scam, Mr. Speaker, where Republicans are trying to visit on the American people the largest cuts to healthcare in American history, targeting Medicaid, Medicare, the Affordable Care Act, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and women's health by trying to defund Planned Parenthood. That is what Republicans in this Congress are trying to do through the GOP tax scam, this disgusting abomination, the one big, ugly bill. My Republican colleagues are going after school lunch programs for children, supplemental nutrition assistance for children, and now children's programming. That doesn't suggest to me that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are actually trying to strengthen families. This legislation would weaken families. It would weaken our ability to lead throughout the free world and weaken public health and safety for everyday Americans and people all across this country. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote. Also, I am hopeful that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will at some point actually decide to focus on the issues that matter, to lift children up, not target them; to lift families up, not target them; to lift older Americans up, not target them; to lift veterans up, not target them; and to lift healthcare for everyday Americans up, not target them. That is what House Democrats will continue to do on behalf of the American people. It is high time that our Republican colleagues join us. Vote ``no'' against this reckless Republican rescissions package.  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, that was fear-mongering at its best. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson)."
"Mr. Speaker, I request a recorded vote."
"Mr. Speaker, I hate to be the exception, but I vote yes."
I would be very happy to ask the Rail Minister to meet the hon. Gentleman to talk about the stations in Birmingham that he mentions.
"I thank my hon. Friend for raising this issue. I am sure we are all familiar with the Golden Hinde from walking along the south bank. Restoring our heritage assets is really important to this Government,   and we announced additional funding to the heritage at risk programme in February. I hope that my hon. Friend and Southwark council can work together to do their bit to restore and bring back to life that great asset."
"Can the Minister tell me how many more children must die before the Government finally ban the sales and export of all UK arms, including component parts, to the murderous Netanyahu Government?"
"I rise today to recognize and congratulate Adam Bell of State College, Pennsylvania. Adam accepted a fully qualified appointment to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Adam is the son of Elizabeth and Jayce Bell, the grandson of E. Ann Wortman and the late Jerry Wortman, as well as Janie and Roy Bell. As a student at State College Area High School, Bell is involved in his high school's culinary program and has represented his school in competitions. He is a varsity athlete in three sports, diving, wrestling, and track, and participates in Model U.N. Whether in the kitchen, on the field, or in the classroom, Adam excels in every area. Bell will continue his athletic pursuits while at the Naval Academy as a pole vaulter for USNA's track and field team. His drive for success will help him excel at the Naval Academy. I wish Adam good luck as he begins the next chapter of his life as a midshipman and student athlete in Annapolis. Mr. Speaker, it was an honor to nominate these young students. Their dedication to serving our country is inspirational. I look forward to seeing their successes in the years to come. Mr. Speaker, I thank them all again for their commitment to our Nation."
"Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague on her speech, but I wish she had spoken more about the opposition day motion than Bill C-4 . Before I ask my question, I would first like to apologize to my colleague. Earlier today, when she asked me a question about my speech on the Bloc Québécois opposition day motion, I came down on her, saying that she would have to explain to her constituents why $10 million was diverted from her riding and given to the rest of Canada. I thought she was a Quebec MP, but she represents an Ontario riding. Consequently, her riding actually benefited from the diversion of those funds. I would like to know whether my colleague can tell me why no Quebec Liberal MP has risen today to speak on this issue. Is her party preventing them from speaking, or are they ashamed of their position?"
"Mr. Chair, given the lateness of the hour, and given the importance of TMX, I humoured the members of the House by talking about that. The fact is, I am Minister of Transport and Internal Trade. I—"
"Mr. Chair, by my clock, I have now used six minutes and 40 seconds. I have seven minutes and a half. I would like to suggest that it does not violate the rules of this place to do something unusual. I have been watching my colleagues, for the fifth night in a row, sitting in one place and abiding by our rules, which the Chair is executing brilliantly. It is tough. It is short answers. People are not having time to breathe or move. As an act of charity, I would like to take my last 10 seconds to count to 10, and I urge my colleagues to stand up and stretch: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. We can now go to the brilliant member for Edmonton Strathcona."
"Mr. Chair, again, it is a bit rich to hear Conservatives criticize the building of a pipeline. We got it built. The previous Conservative government did not. I am very proud of that pipeline. It is diversifying the Canadian economy today. It is giving us an alternative to the U.S. It is a nation-building project, and it is operating right now. It is making—"
"Mr. Speaker, as it is my first time rising in this Parliament, I would like to take the opportunity to express my appreciation and thanks to the people of Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam for electing me to a fourth term in this place. I am pleased about an important initiative in British Columbia, in the Lower Mainland, to save our local news. Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Burnaby, New Westminster, Anmore and Belcarra lost local news coverage when Glacier Media shuttered their papers. People no longer know what is happening in their council chambers, read news about their little league teams or learn about that new cookie shop downtown. Last week, I learned about the Save Our Local News campaign. Headed by former local reporters Janice Cleugh, Cornelia Naylor, Mario Bartel and Theresa McManus, it will create a new, reliable news outlet with the support of Unifor. Please join me to save our local news."
"if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous order. There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:55 p.m., adjourned until Tuesday, June 24, 2025, at 2:15 p.m."
"I do not think there is much to add, but I want to thank all the Members who have come here today and shared their personal experiences of dementia affecting family members and loved ones. I know it is not an easy thing to do, and we all have really difficult experiences. It has been very moving to hear those personal stories. We have a Minister who deeply feels these issues and understands what dementia means and the impact on the wider family. I would like to see properly trained dementia nurses in every GP surgery and acute hospital trust in this country, so that we can keep these people at home, look after them, look after their carers, and support the people who love them and do an incredible job. I pay tribute to the hundreds of organisations all over the country that are doing amazing work, many of them on a voluntary basis. Question put and agreed to. Resolved, That this House has considered dementia care."
"I thank my hon. Friend for making an important case for the transport infrastructure that her constituents rely on. The case that she makes for her constituency in Greater London is very similar to those being made for other parts of the country. People need to be able to get to the opportunities that we are creating; those opportunities need to be made available to them. The Government are ensuring that by investing in every nation and region across the United Kingdom, including London. I look forward to further announcements in the spending review that will fulfil the promise of change that she and the Government made to her constituents."
"Knowing the Leader of the House to be a decent person, I suspect that behind the scenes, when events of this sort happen, she probably argues quite strongly that announcements should be made to this House first and to the press afterwards. Does she think the reason that is not happening is that the Government genuinely think they will get less publicity to hold a press conference after there has been scrutiny in the House, or is it that they just have no confidence that they can stop their people leaking things in advance?"
"Mr. Chair, again, people whose visa expires, or people who should not be here, need to leave. If they do not, that is a CBSA—"
"For the benefit of younger Members, Bobby Davro was a comedian."
"I rise today to recognize the extraordinary achievement of the Davenport Assumption girls' soccer team, who have once again made Iowa history. With a 2-0 victory over the number one ranked Denver Cyclones, the Knights captured their record-setting 12th Iowa State Championship. This win marks their first title since 2021 and is a testament to the perseverance, heart, and teamwork that defines Iowa athletes. Led by senior Dru Dorsey and freshman Ruby Stevens, the Knights showed skill, leadership, and grit on the field. Dorsey scored one goal and assisted on the other, setting the tone and sealing the win. From defense to offense, the entire squad played with unity and determination. This moment is more than a victory. It is a legacy, and it speaks to what young women in sports can accomplish when they believe in each other, never give up, and have a level playing field. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Coach Elizabeth Maus, the players, and the entire Davenport Assumption community. They have made their sport, their school, and their State proud.  Recognizing Carla Eysink"
"I thank the hon. Member for her intervention. Of course there are situations in which a decision to end one's life is perfectly understandable--indeed, rational. I spent my career looking after people, many of whom presented to me and to medical services with thoughts about wanting to end their life. Many of them had mental illness. Some had terminal illness. The fundamental problem with the Bill is that it has a complete blind spot for those people who are highly vulnerable. It is scandalous that we have got to this point and are still having a debate about the core concepts. The Bill should have been dealt with properly from the start with a royal commission or a review so that we did not get to the point where we are still debating core principles on Report. Over the past months, I have tabled amendments that I thought would help get the Bill--if it becomes law--to a point of ensuring that the most vulnerable are protected. My amendments 19 and 20 would work to edit the code of practice for the Bill to ensure that there is clear guidance with regard to doctors' duties, suicide prevention, article 2 on the protection of human life, and interaction with the Mental Health Act. The Bill is currently blind on what to do with people detained in hospital and patients presenting with suicidal thoughts. I have great concerns that many people who are quite unwell psychologically will start presenting to services seeking an ""assisted death"" rather than presenting with suicidal ideation."
"I welcome the UK-India trade deal, which is good for salmon and good for whisky. Will the Secretary of State use his muscle to ensure that a chain of small distilleries in my constituency and across Scotland can sell a wee dram to India, as well as the big brands? Mr Speaker, I would like to draw the House's attention to reports of a crash on take-off of a London-bound Air India flight from India today, and allow the Secretary of State to express our concern."
"The right hon. Gentleman is exactly right that the entire Bill, to an extent, is about whistleblowing, because it allows anyone in our armed forces and their relevant family members to raise a concern outside the chain of command. Effectively, that is the very heart and soul of what we propose in this legislation. I will come to the amendment in lieu in a moment, but certainly, with that, we seek to strengthen the provisions that Baroness Goldie's amendments propose. We agree that there is an issue that needs to be addressed within our armed forces and we recognise that there are behaviours that are unacceptable. The Ministry of Defence's Raising our Standards work, which the Minister for Veterans and People leads on, is an important part of providing an opportunity for everyone who serves to raise those concerns and have confidence that they can do so within the chain of command, but where they feel unable to do so, there will be a route available to them through the Armed Forces Commissioner to raise those concerns. Equally, as I just mentioned to my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Michelle Scrogham), this is about the ability of family members, who may feel less constrained by the chain of command or the structure of the armed forces, to do so on behalf of their family unit. I entirely understand the purpose of the amendments and I agree with their spirit, but we seek to strengthen them in the amendment in lieu. One of the key parts of the amendments was to ensure that anyone who raises a concern will have their identity protected. It worth noting that the Armed Forces Commissioner will be bound by the data protection legislation that this House has passed, meaning that the personal information and details provided by anyone who contacts the commissioner will be subject to stringent controls. On the specifics of the word ""whistleblower"", we all understand what we mean when we hear that term, and it is important that we provide opportunities for those within our services to raise concerns. However, it is not completely straightforward from a legal point of view how that is enacted in this piece of legislation. Although there is some limited precedent for the use of the term, there is no single meaning and it requires additional context to explain what it means in each case. That  means some technical changes are required to Baroness Goldie's amendment to make it operable within the Bill, which is why we seek to strengthen it. The amendments seek to define the term in reference to certain people and topics, but importantly, no additional protections are created because the commissioner can already investigate anything that is contained in the amendment proposed by Baroness Goldie. However, it is a useful opportunity for us to restate the importance of being able to raise concerns, especially about the abuse that happens in our armed forces, and to state on the record from the Dispatch Box that there is no place for any of that abuse in our armed forces and that not only is the Ministry of Defence taking steps to tackle it but there are protections in the Bill to enable that. None the less, I understand the intention behind the amendments, which is to ensure that people feel better able to approach the commissioner without fear of repercussions or their identity being made public. I wholeheartedly agree with the spirit behind that. A united voice from this House, saying that we will not tolerate unacceptable behaviours, will send a strong message to those watching this debate--both perpetrators and complainants--that the zero tolerance approach we want for the armed forces is one that we will all get behind."
"Mr. Speaker, just as a point of clarification about the regulation they are talking about, which is not as they describe, let us be clear that there is no ban on gas-powered vehicles. They can read the regulations. To be clear, what we are doing is making sure that EVs are available to Canadians. Some 546,000 Canadians accessed our rebate to purchase vehicles because they wanted them."
"It has often been said that the courts rejected the legacy Act, at least in part. I am not aware of which part specifically they rejected, but I would like to remind the ministerial team that in 2017 the then Defence Committee examined in great detail whether it would be legal to have a statute of limitation that would put an end to these prosecutions. Four professors of law, including Philippe Sands, agreed that it would be, as long as there was an investigative process, possibly embodied in a truth recovery process. When the Government bring forward whatever alternative legislation to the legacy Act they propose, will they make sure that a statute of limitation is part of it?"
"I thank the Secretary of State for her statement, and for the recent move to protect existing claimants. I appreciate that the adult disability payment is devolved to the Scottish Government. However, my constituents are really concerned about the potential for different qualifying criteria across the nations, which may result in limited access to passported benefits from November 2026. What assurances can the Secretary of State give my constituents that they will not lose the benefits to which they currently have access, and the vital support on which their households rely? Following the Secretary of State's response to my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Helen Hayes), it is really unclear whether the House is being asked to agree to a four-point assessment without knowing the outcome of the Timms review with regard to descriptors--or could that review result in more fundamental reforms that would rip up the current PIP system?"
I thank the parliamentary secretary for his intervention. I thank the member for London—Fanshawe. Those are all matters of debate. I will let the parliamentary secretary to the secretary of state for combatting crime finish his speech.
"reserving the right to object, the naming ofnaval ships is a long and proud naval tradition that goes back to America's first frigates commissioned by Congress. Then, as now, the naming of a ship is not just a top-down affair. It demands the input and consideration of the journey men and women who constructed her, as well as her prospective crew and captain, right down to the lowest ranking sailor. Those individuals are known in naval tradition as plank owners, and that title brings with it an honor that they were the first to sail aboard a ship that will serve our country for generations. That is an honor that transcends political partisanship and differences of opinion, and it belongs to the sailors. It is no secret that the last administration took a top-down approach to the naming of our newest class of USNS oilers. In doing so, they broke with important naval customs and traditions and robbed the USNS plank owners of the chance to name these vessels after what mattered most to them. It is true that civilian leaders in Congress and the White House have always had a say in ship naming as well. George Washington selected the names of our first six frigates, but he did so from a list provided by the plank owners--the ships' crews and captains. Navy tradition, like the name of a ship, lives in the hearts and minds of every sailor, and these traditions are vital to preserving the morale and fighting spirit of our forces. Resetting the stage is not a political issue. It is bringing things back in line with naval custom and tradition. It will allow the Secretary of the Navy to consider the input of new ship plank owners so that he can name this class of ships after the things that matter most to America's sailors. For these reasons, I object."
"Mr. Speaker, I would argue that we have one of the leading economists in the world running our government right now. The fundamentals of our economy are strong. Canadians had a decision to make on April 28, and they resoundingly picked the Prime Minister to lead our country, because they have confidence in him and they have faith in him. When he speaks, he thinks. It is not about slogans. Our economy will be the best in the G7, just give us a bit of time."
"We are investing in our vital transport infrastructure and in skills, and getting the NHS back on its feet. Our landmark Employment Rights Bill will improve the quality of work, and our increases in the national minimum wage are helping make work pay. But alongside these vital steps, we need to reform the welfare state. The principles set out in our ""Pathways to Work"" Green Paper are rooted in values that I know many MPs share: that those who can work must work, but often need proper support to do so; that those who can never work must be protected; and that the welfare state must be fair both for those who need support and for taxpayers, so that it is sustainable for generations to come. But the system we inherited from the Conservative party is failing on all those fronts. It incentivises people to define themselves as incapable of work just to be able to afford to live. It then writes them off, and denies them any help or support. The result is 2.8 million of our fellow citizens now out of work due to long-term sickness, and almost 1 million young people not in education, employment or training, which is a staggering one in eight of all our young people. The future sustainability of the system has also been put at risk, with the number of people on personal independence payment set to more than double this decade to over 4 million, with awards increasing at twice the rate of increases in the prevalence of disabled people in our society, adding 1,000 new PIP awards every single day. I know that Government Members have welcomed many aspects of our reforms: our plans to bring in the first ever sustained, above-inflation rise to the universal credit standard allowance--the first permanent, real-terms increase in the headline rate of out-of-work benefits since the 1970s--which is an historic change in the direction of public policy; the biggest ever investment in employment support for sick and disabled people, quadrupling what we inherited from the Tories to PS1 billion  a year; our plans to ensure that people with severe, lifelong health conditions will never be reassessed, removing all the unnecessary and unacceptable anxiety this brings; and our plans to legislate for a right to try, guaranteeing that trying work in and of itself will never lead to a benefit reassessment and giving people the confidence to take the plunge and try work, which many organisations have called for for years. However, there have also been real concerns about our initial proposals. We have listened carefully, and we are making positive changes as a result. First and foremost, many Members of the House, alongside disabled people and their organisations, have been very concerned about requiring existing claimants to score a minimum of four points on at least one activity to be eligible for the daily living component of PIP when they are reassessed after November 2026. They have also been concerned that the pace of change was too fast. I fully understand that even though nine out of 10 people claiming PIP when the changes come in would be unaffected by the end of this Parliament, this has caused deep and widespread anxiety among existing claimants, because they rely on the income from PIP for so many different aspects of their lives. So we will now ensure that the new four-point requirement will apply only to new claims from November 2026. This means that no existing claimants will lose PIP because of the changes brought forward in the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill, and existing claimants of passported benefits such as carer's allowance will continue to get them, too. Some people have said they are concerned that this will create a two-tier system, but I say to the House, including Conservative Members, that our benefits system often protects existing claimants from new rates or new rules, because lives have been built around that support and it is often very hard for people to adjust. For example, some people still receive the severe disablement allowance, which was closed to new claims in 2001. When Labour introduced the local housing allowance in 2008, existing claimants stayed on the old, higher rates of housing benefit, and many people are still on disability living allowance, which PIP replaced in 2013. We believe that protecting existing claimants, while beginning to focus PIP on those with higher needs for new claimants, strikes the right and fair balance. The second important question raised by Members was about seeing more details of our wider review of the PIP assessment before being asked to vote on the changes in the Bill. Many MPs also want to know that the views and voices of disabled people will be heard at the heart of our plans. So we have today published the terms of reference for our wider PIP review, led by the Minister for Social Security and Disability, to ensure that this vital benefit is fit for the future, taking account of changes in society since it was first introduced. The review will look at the role of the PIP assessment, including activities, descriptors and the associated points, to ensure that they properly capture the impact of long-term health conditions and disability in the modern world. It will be co-produced with disabled people, their organisations, clinicians, other experts and MPs before reporting to the Secretary of State by autumn next year, and implemented as soon as possible thereafter. The third issue of concern was that our plans to freeze the universal credit health top-up for existing claimants, and for future claimants with severe lifelong health  conditions and those at the end of life, would not protect incomes in real terms, even with the increase in the universal credit standard allowance. I can today confirm that we will ensure, for those groups, the combined value of the universal credit standard allowance and the health top-up will rise at least in line with inflation, protecting their income from these benefits in real terms, every year, for the rest of this Parliament. Together, with the changes to our proposals for PIP, that will ensure that no existing claimants are put into poverty as a result of the changes in the Bill. Finally, while there has been widespread support for the extra investment that we are putting into employment support for sick and disabled people, I know that many Labour Members have been concerned that that is not enough. I can today announce that we are putting an additional PS300 million into employment support for sick and disabled people. We will be delivering a total of PS600 million for support next year, PS800 million the year after and PS1 billion in 2028-29, increasing our total spending on employment support for sick and disabled people to PS3.8 billion over this Parliament, because disabled people who can work should not wait to have the same rights and chances to work as everybody else. The measures that we are announcing today will cost around PS2.5 billion in 2029-30, and the overall savings and costings of our reform package will be certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility in the normal way at the next fiscal event. Welfare reform is never easy, but it is essential because there is no route to equality or social justice based on greater benefit spending alone. The path to a fairer society, where everyone can thrive, where people who can work get the support they need and where we protect those who cannot work--that is the path we seek to build with our reforms. Our plans are rooted in fairness for those who need support and for taxpayers. They are about ensuring the welfare state survives, so that there is always a safety net for those who need it and that it lasts for generations to come. Above all, our reforms are rooted in our fundamental belief that everyone can fulfil their potential and live their hopes and dreams if we provide them with the right help and support. This is the better future that we seek to build for our constituents and our country. I commend this statement to the House."
"it is a privilege to rise today to recognize Mr. Patrick Sullivan for his service at Withlacoochee River Electric Cooperative (WREC) and his remarkable role in the Light Up Navajo Project. In May, a courageous team of 16 WREC employees traveled over 1,800 miles to the remote, rugged terrains of Arizona and New Mexico, where they spent two weeks installing vital electrical infrastructure for Navajo families who have lived without power for generations. Their efforts brought light, safety, and hope to communities long overlooked, allowing children to study after dark, families to preserve food, and elders to live with greater comfort. Despite daunting challenges and limited equipment, the WREC team completed a demanding project in just eight days--far ahead of expectations--demonstrating professionalism, humility, and unwavering commitment to this life-changing mission. The impact of WREC's work goes far beyond electricity; it represents a bridge to connection, opportunity, and the return of future generations to their ancestral homes. The emotional moment when power was turned on for the impacted families--bringing tears of joy and renewed hope--is a testament to the profound difference this project made. WREC's participation in the ``Light Up Navajo'' initiative reflects not only their technical expertise but also their heart and respect for the people they serve. Their dedication has energized ten homesteads and countless lives, creating a legacy of service that embodies the true spirit of cooperative values. The WREC team's journey inspires us all, proving that with compassion and teamwork even the most daunting challenges can be overcome to light up lives and communities. I commend the entire team for their efforts on this worthwhile endeavor and for their ongoing service to our local community."
"Mr. Speaker, it will have been 18 months since this country saw a federal budget. We all recall the fiasco when the fall economic statement was dropped in this Parliament. Would the hon. member not agree that this is the time to have a budget so that Canadians can openly and transparently see what the numbers are? Of course, in the fall, we knew that the Liberals had blown through their fiscal guardrail and the deficit was $60 billion. Does the member share my sentiment, perhaps a cynic might, that they are actually trying to cook the books and hide the numbers from Canadians?"
"Mr. Chair, I am not sure where the minister has been for the last 10 years. Apparently, no bankers lost their jobs. How many of the crude oil pipeline projects that were applied for since 2015 have been completed to date?"
"I rise to speak to new clause 155, which stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton West (Phil   Brickell) and is supported by the all-party parliamentary group on anti-corruption and responsible tax. I welcome the Bill for its clear and ambitious strategy to tackle antisocial behaviour and crime, but if we want truly safer streets, we must also step up our efforts to tackle financial and economic crime. That is the aim of our amendment, which is supported by at least 30 Members from across the House. Economic crime is now the most commonly experienced crime in the UK, accounting for more than 40% of all reported incidents, yet we invest just 0.05% of GDP in enforcement. That is not sustainable and these crimes are not victimless--they erode public trust, exploit our financial institutions, and hollow out high streets and communities. In my constituency of Kensington and Bayswater, from Earl's Court Road to Queensway, Notting Hill Gate and Portobello Road, residents and small business owners are fed up with the proliferation of suspicious, cash-intensive businesses such as candy stores, low-grade souvenir shops, Harry Potter shops and barbershops. These businesses are more than just an eyesore; I hear persistent concerns about VAT evasion, rates avoidance, and even troubling links to serious organised crime and money laundering. For those reasons, I was very encouraged by Operation Machinize, the National Crime Agency-led crackdown on barbershops suspected of laundering criminal funds earlier this year. I take this opportunity to put on record my thanks to the leadership of the NCA and the Serious Fraud Office, and to their frontline staff; they have engaged closely with the APPG on anti-corruption and responsible tax, which I chair. Those organisations are doing excellent work, but they cannot tackle this problem alone. We need proper cross-Government co-ordination and resources for enforcement. New clause 155 would require the Government to assess the options for creating an economic crime fighting fund. It would be a pooled fund financed by a share of the assets already recovered through enforcement--confiscations, fines and deferred prosecution agreements. It would not be new money; that money is recovered by our enforcement agencies, but currently it is returned to the Treasury and often left unspent due to outdated annularity rules. In 2022, for instance, the NCA had to return PS15 million of recovered criminal assets because it could not spend the money fast enough. That is inefficient and perverse. Such a fund would create a virtuous cycle, with more enforcement, more recovery and greater deterrence. The SFO returns PS3 for every PS1 invested, which is smart economics and a compelling argument for long-term, sustainable resourcing. With the Financial Action Task Force review on the horizon, the UK needs to demonstrate that it has the financial and technical capacity to take this issue seriously. Otherwise, we risk falling behind our global partners in the fight against corruption and illicit finance. I look forward to the forthcoming publication of the Government's anti-corruption strategy, and I have valued the opportunity to work closely with the anti-corruption champion, Baroness Hodge, in shaping that strategy. The Foreign Secretary is also right to make it his mission to position the UK as the global capital of anti-corruption, and to   commit to a summit on financial crime next year. The ambition is clear, but we must now match it with resources, co-ordination and reform. Very briefly, I will highlight an area in which this Bill will make a real difference. The right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith) referred to new clause 5. Many residents of Kensington and Bayswater have contacted me about the dangerous and antisocial use of illegally modified e-bikes, especially by delivery drivers. That includes speeding, reckless pavement riding and off-road use. I am a cyclist--unlike the right hon. Gentleman, I am not a motorcyclist--and I support active travel and safe cycling, but what we are seeing is dangerous, and residents have had enough. As such, I am glad that the Bill will give the police the power to seize and destroy illegally modified e-bikes within 48 hours, building on powers that already exist under section 59 of the Police Reform Act 2022. I thank the Minister for recently confirming to me that delivery e-bikes will be covered by the new provisions, and for taking into account the concerns of my community. I hope she will look kindly on our request for support in sustainably funding the fight against economic crime."
"Madam Speaker, the hon. member's words were kind. I invite him to come back to my great constituency of Davenport any time. He was very popular and very well loved. I will say that the dental care program is one of the life-saving programs in my community. I have a largely working-class constituency, so a program like the national dental care program is a life-saver for many of them. The fact that it has been extended now to all Canadians who qualify and are eligible under the criteria is, I think, going to save them money. Again, it is going to ensure that we are providing the support Canadians need during this time of high prices."
"I rise today to honor and congratulate Jeff Willis on his retirement from the Big Bear City Fire Department after nearly four decades of dedicated service. Throughout his career, Jeff served as a firefighter, engineer, captain, division chief, assistant chief, fire marshal, and fire chief. Jeff is renowned in our community as a selfless and caring individual and is a true friend to all who have the privilege of knowing him. A resident of the Big Bear community for over 48 years, Jeff attended local schools prior to joining the Big Bear City Fire Department as a paid call firefighter at 18 years old. Jeff was promoted to paid call engineer within 2 years and advanced to the rank of fire captain just 2 years later--a true testament to his unique skillset and exceptional abilities. In 2007, at just 43 years old, Jeff became the youngest fire chief in the history of the Big Bear City Fire Department. Jeff's additional accolades include serving as a board member for the Fire Districts Association of California and as both chair and vice chair of the Joint Legislative Task Force representing the California Fire Chiefs Association. Jeff's decorated career and service to Big Bear City would not have been possible without the support of his family. His wife, Yvette; his three sons, Brandon, Jordan, and Kadon; his two stepsons, Joshua and Brennan Eddy; his mother, Barbara; and his late father, Ken, were instrumental in supporting his work in keeping our community safe. Jeff had a profound impact on our community and the Big Bear City Fire Department. Heather and I deeply appreciate Jeff for his years of service, and we wish him and his family well as they enter this next stage of his already eventful and purposeful life. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Jeff Willis and celebrating his retirement."
"Mr. Speaker, the minister says that they are working in unity, but the only unity that we are seeing is that the Liberals do not want to see another export pipeline built in Canada. Is there consensus, or is there not?"
"Mr. Speaker, it is a very significant day today. The Prime Minister and Liberal candidates from across the country made a solid commitment as part of our election platform to build one Canadian economy. It was on page 1 of the platform. Sometime in the next half-hour, we are going to be passing Bill C-5 . That is a checkoff. That is something the Prime Minister and the Liberal caucus pushed through to fulfill a solemn commitment we made to Canadians. I will conclude by saying that in the last number of weeks, we have seen all sorts of initiatives from a new Prime Minister and a new administration. We are making a difference. We will continue to work hard for Canadians. Could the leader of the Green Party explain why, in a nutshell, she feels that this bill should not pass?"
"I am sure that the whole House, on both sides, will concur with the Minister's final remarks. I thank him and the Opposition Front Benchers for their attendance."
"May I start with the important point that the hon. Lady makes about Ballymena? I utterly condemn the violence that we saw overnight in Ballymena and other parts of Northern Ireland, including against PSNI officers. It is absolutely vital that the PSNI is given the time it needs to investigate the incidents concerned, rather than face mindless attacks as it seeks to bring peace and order to keep people safe. The Northern Ireland Secretary is in touch with the PSNI and the Executive, and I am being kept updated in relation to that. In relation to the tragic cases that the hon. Lady mentions, I thank her for raising them. It is important that we have a legal duty of candour and we will be introducing that, because, as she says, there must be the truth here, based on all people being dealt with on the basis of dignity, fairness and accountability."
"My hon. Friend has set out some of the challenges the Bill presents for the farming community. Part 5 provides authorities with significant compulsory purchase powers, but with no definition or limits whatsoever. For our farming community, this all comes on top of the changes to agricultural property relief, business property relief and inheritance tax, and the increased national insurance for employers. What is it about the farming community that this Government do not like?"
"Mr. Speaker, our government is taking strong, targeted action to support the people of Ukraine and to hold Russia accountable for its ongoing war of aggression. In one of our most significant sanctions packages since the invasion began in 2022, we are imposing new sanctions on 77 individuals and 39 entities, and restricting trade on nearly 1,000 items, including those linked to chemical weapons, advanced technologies and critical industrial goods. We are also expanding our crackdown on Russia's shadow fleet by listing over 200 additional vessels, now totalling more than 300, and banning all related services to disrupt Russia's global shipping networks. Sanctions also target key financial institutions, energy companies and individuals enabling Russia's military and disinformation efforts. Canada stands firmly with the people of Ukraine as well as all those in the G7 whose courage and resilience continue to—"
"Mr. Speaker, last week the Liberal government tabled a $486-billion spending bill. The Prime Minister promised during the election that he would govern Canada with a new fiscal discipline. It seems as though we have a case of meet the new boss, just the same as the old boss. While many people in northern Ontario struggle to make ends meet with the ever-increasing costs of everyday life, the Liberals do not get it. They seem to talk a good game of fiscal restraint, but talk is cheap, unlike the cost of living. The Prime Minister 's first bill would do nothing to ease the burden of skyrocketing mortgage payments, groceries and energy. Instead, it would increase government spending by 8%, including a 36% increase for consultants. When will the Liberals put the interests of everyday Canadians ahead of their well-connected insiders in Ottawa?"
"Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise on behalf of the people from Kamloops—Thompson—Nicola. I want to give a shout-out to somebody who helped my campaign a tremendous amount, and that was Mr. Spencer Paul. I thank Spencer. To my hon. colleague, I wonder if he would agree with my sentiment, which is that the Liberals have allowed a porous border and, at the same time, have not dealt with guns, trafficking or bail, yet none of these things are in the bill. It is like they have created a mess and put an omnibus bill here before us. Does he not see it as a bit rich that the Liberals are also not dealing with the things they have created and made a mess of?"
Agreed.
"Mr. Chair, we believe in making investments in priorities that are most important to Canadians, and we are taking actions to build up a country where everyone has an equal opportunity to thrive."
"Will the Foreign Secretary now concede that the international community's unwillingness to take robust action through things like the snapback mechanism and the JCPOA is part of the reason that Israel felt the need to take the initial strikes and America to do likewise? I agree that diplomatic means will ultimately be the only long-term resolution,  but that means not just asking nicely for Iran to put its nuclear weapons away, but enforcing that and ensuring it does so through such mechanisms. Will the Foreign Secretary ensure that if we are not going to be involved in military action--I understand why we might not want to do that--we will ensure that robust action is taken, and that it is underpinned by measures that will force Iran to do the right thing, rather than just hoping that it will do the right thing?"
"Hungry children do not learn, so I thank the Government for listening to those of us who have long campaigned for this announcement. This Government's reforms are starting to put more money into people's pockets, tackling the root causes of poverty, but they will take time to bed in--time that hungry children simply do not have. The Minister knows that poverty is all-encompassing and extends well beyond the school day. Will he give the 470,000 children affected by the cruel two-child benefit cap some hope today that the Government are seriously considering scrapping the cap, and considering scrapping it very soon?"
"I can certainly name a number. I also refer the hon. Member to Hansard on Tuesday 11 March, column 953, where I named a small business. A number of other businesses have been in support: Centrica, Co-op, Richer Sounds, Nationwide, Adept, One+All, Pedal Me, Inkwell--there are many businesses that we talk to on a regular basis and that understand that treating staff well is a good thing for those businesses. It is a pro-growth, pro-worker measure."
"I rise to support new clause 39. Building large-scale solar farms on productive agricultural land is short-sighted. The proposed Maen Hir project, classed as a nationally significant infrastructure project, will cover over 3,000 acres of agricultural land on Ynys Mon. This is not just any land; it is land that sustains rural livelihoods and underpins the economic and cultural identity of the island. Let us not forget why Ynys Mon is known as Mon Mam Cymru--the mother of Wales. Our island has long been the breadbasket of the nation, playing a key role in food production. This land is not just soil; it is security. Replacing it with solar panels serves developers, not communities. The climate crisis will make suitable agricultural land scarcer, which makes protecting what we have now even more important. Once such land is lost to development, we will not get it back. That is not sustainability but short-term gain at long-term cost. We see serious inconsistency in how planning policy is applied. In Wales, under the planning process, good-quality agricultural land is considered for smaller-scale developments, but when it comes to large-scale NSIPs, such as Maen Hir, those protections seem to vanish. The contradiction between Welsh and UK Government policy is unacceptable. There must be a level playing field, regardless of the scale of proposals. We have already felt the impact of energy insecurity in recent years. Let us not repeat the same mistakes with food security. I ask the Government to rethink their approach; to protect our agricultural land, our economy and our communities; and to support new clause 39."
"With the safeguards that have been put in the Bill, there will be a panel that looks at those issues and  asks questions like, ""Has your doctor persuaded you to do this?"" Do we honestly think that a social worker, psychiatrist or lawyer is totally incapable of finding coercion? That is exactly what the panel is there to do, and that is exactly what those safeguards will provide."
"Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that we have a Minister of Transport and Internal Trade . I am not allowed to say her name, but I think it is important that as cabinet colleagues and MPs, we all work together to ensure that we are able to reduce barriers to grow internal trade throughout our country."
"The Government are determined to reduce youth reoffending as part of our safer streets mission. Despite the fiscal challenges we inherited, we have increased our core funding to youth offending teams and extended our effective Turnaround programme."
"Mr. Speaker, there seems to be a misunderstanding about what nation building is. In fact, this bill has been called a fast track to the Supreme Court, meaning no building of the economy and no new jobs. I am wondering why the Conservatives are supporting a bill that is going to spend more time holding up projects in the courts than getting things done on the ground."
"Mr. Speaker, we can control the industrial carbon tax, unlike the unjustified U.S. tariffs, so why not remove it in the face of the threat?"
"Mr. Chair, is the Crawford nickel-cobalt mine in the national interest?"
"Mr. Speaker, I request a recorded vote, please."
The Chair has notice of a request for an emergency debate from the hon. member for Vancouver East.
"Britain is at the heart of diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation in the middle east. We are clear that Iran must never have a nuclear weapon. While at the UK, EU, G7 and NATO summits and in my engagements from the high north to north Africa, the Government have been delivering security and growth for the British people, deepening Britain's partnerships and alliances, and addressing the ongoing horrendous conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine."
"Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in today's debate and to reiterate our government's immediate priorities for making life more affordable for all Canadians, including Quebeckers. Ultimately, this motion and debate boil down to affordability. I will therefore take a moment to focus on the logic behind the consumer carbon tax rebate, although I would also like to pause in order to go over some of the important measures that our government has taken to make life more affordable for Canadians. Quebeckers and Canadians asked for a serious plan for change to deal with the rising cost of living that has eroded their quality of life; change that puts more money in the pockets of Quebeckers and Canadians; change that will build the strongest economy in the G7; change that builds one Canadian economy out of 13 and that includes a strong Quebec; and change that builds an affordable Quebec and an affordable Canada. During this session, our government has introduced important and ambitious legislation to make life more affordable for Quebeckers. Bill C-5 , the one Canadian economy act, sets out legislative measures designed to eliminate internal trade barriers and promote projects of national significance. It sets out a broad framework for liberalizing the Canadian economy, diversifying trade and improving national productivity, resilience and competitiveness. In Bill C‑4 , we have put forward three important measures that will put more money in the pockets of Quebeckers at a time when they really need it. First of all, Bill C-4 would implement our government's middle-class tax cut, which would provide tax relief to 22 million Canadians, including 4 million Quebeckers, and save two-income families up to $840 per year in 2026. Once this legislation is enacted, the lowest individual marginal income tax rate would fall from 15% to 14% as of July 1 of this year. This tax cut would help hard-working Quebeckers and Canadians keep more of what they earn in their pockets and build a solid future. This tax cut will primarily benefit the Canadian workers who need it the most. That means that most of the tax relief will go to the two lowest income tax brackets, with close to half the tax savings going to those in the lowest tax bracket. In addition, Bill C-4 would start providing tax relief almost immediately. With our middle-class tax cut announcement, the Canada Revenue Agency can update its source deduction tables for the period from July to December 2025, so that pay administrators can reduce income tax as of July 1. Further, Bill C-4 will remove the GST for first-time buyers of new homes valued at up to $1 million. That is great news."
"Mr. Speaker, I am wondering whether the member could just provide his thoughts. Does he believe in a due process that would allow the courts and the civil service to do their job?"
"I agree with the hon. Gentleman's sentiment that much of this was foreseeable; none of us could know precisely who was going to say what, but even a cursory glance at Google would show that this particular artist has a history of provoking extreme statements and behaviour, particularly in relation to events in the middle east. So it would not have been too difficult to foresee that, and there are therefore serious questions to answer about livestreaming, due diligence and other factors. I expect a response from the BBC on those questions and about the action that it will take to ensure that this does not happen again. If those answers are not forthcoming, I have various levers with which I can hold the BBC to account, and I want to be clear with the hon. Gentleman and with the House that I will not hesitate to use them, if I need to do so."
"I appreciate how frustrating the situation is for my hon. Friend and his constituents. My officials are continuing to discuss details of the business case for the scheme with East Sussex county council, and I would of course be happy to meet him to discuss that further."
"Children with educational needs in Portsmouth still face long waits and a shortage of school places; families are waiting, and schools are stretched. Can the Minister set out how the Department is working with local authorities to expand high-quality provision in areas such as Portsmouth, and whether the spending review includes targeted capital or revenue support for this area? If education is to drive growth, skills reform must be front and centre, and I am glad that is part of Labour's priority. Colleges are central to this. Students and staff at Portsmouth college are eager to do more, but need the right investment. Ambition is vital, because the role of education is not just social, but economic. The spending review must be understood as part of the wider industrial strategy that Labour is delivering. Skills reform, youth hubs and the creation of Skills England are vital tools to align training with the future of our jobs, and the Department must ensure that schools, colleges and businesses are integrated into this strategy. We also need to get serious about apprenticeships--not just for school leavers, but for older learners and those changing careers. We need to talk about access, because apprenticeships must work for everybody. I have heard from constituents in their 20s and 30s and beyond who want to reskill, but cannot afford the drop in income. Although it may seem radical, I wonder whether the Minister would consider a means-tested apprenticeship loan system similar to student finance with an automated repayment tied into income above the living wage. That kind of support could transform access for working parents, carers and those who want to change their career. As a Government Member and a member of the Education Committee, I am proud of the Government's work. The spending review lays solid foundations, but there is a long way to go. Portsmouth North is a place of talent, determination and potential. Labour's plan is already delivering change, but if we truly want an economy built on skills and a society built on fairness, we must keep pushing forward."
"Mr. Speaker, Canada has so much to offer the world. It really does. I know that the members opposite tend to focus on pipelines and conventional energy, but Canada has so many advantages around the world. Our agricultural industry is a source of pride for us. Our critical mineral and mining industry is very much a source of pride for us. Quebec and many other parts of the country have a strength in AI, which can augment and enhance productivity across industries. Business models can achieve a lot more and productivity gains can be had. The clean-tech industry, which I am obviously privy to, has a really large strength in Canada. We punch well above our weight. We have a lot to gain with a lot of possibilities. I certainly respect the members opposite for wanting to advocate for conventional energy, but I think we must understand that we need a balanced—"
"I declare an interest as a pilot. In this context, I spoke to one of the would-be producers--I think it is called Zero--and its primary concern with respect to the strike price  mechanism that the right hon. Lady talks about is how that will be set and what input producers will have. Will she address that when she talks through the mechanism?"
"Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I welcome you to your place today. It is an honour to speak in this debate on behalf of His Majesty's Opposition, and I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Dudley (Sonia Kumar) for securing it. Her speech included the wealth of experience that she brings to the topic, and I especially congratulate her on putting this issue so clearly on the agenda today in the House. It was a powerful and wide-ranging speech that demonstrated the wide range of issues and conditions that can lead to incontinence. As the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Jodie Gosling) told us earlier, incontinence is a condition that affects around 14 million people across the UK, yet too often it remains misunderstood, under-discussed and--worse still--dismissed. One in three women experience urinary incontinence, and half a million adults live with bowel incontinence. Incontinence does not discriminate; whether bladder or bowel, temporary or chronic, or mild or severe, it touches people of all ages, backgrounds and walks of life. It affects new mothers, people recovering from surgery, those with neurological conditions, the elderly, and even children. However, too many suffer in silence, held back by stigma, isolation, or the belief that nothing can be done. Like other Members, I received some heartbreaking stories from my constituents in Farnham, Bordon, Haslemere, Liphook and the surrounding villages. Incontinence is a medical issue, not a personal failing. It is not something to be ashamed of; it is something to be addressed through compassion, awareness and proper care. The impact of incontinence can be profound. It affects people's confidence, their work, their relationships and their mental health. That is why Continence Week, which we are currently marking, matters. We cannot expect people to reach out for help unless we first create a culture where they feel safe and supported in doing so. We also need to ensure that services are in place to respond when they do seek help. That means better access to continence nurses, urologists, and physiotherapists, such as the hon. Member for Dudley. It means investing in community support, and in research and innovation, and recognising that continence care is a core part of our health system, not an afterthought. I therefore welcome the Government's stated ambition to tackle inequalities in women's health and to address conditions such as incontinence more seriously, but warm words and long-term ambitions are not enough when so many continue to struggle. For example, the ""Excellence in Continence Care"" guidance, first published in 2018, was a groundbreaking piece of work, but we  now need clear next steps, funding and measurable outcomes. We must not allow this to drift for another seven years while millions suffer in silence. Under the previous Conservative Government, we delivered real and lasting progress in this area. In 2022, we published England's first ever women's health strategy, a genuine turning point shaped by listening to more than 100,000 women's voices. That strategy committed to trauma-informed care, expanded research and, crucially, improved the quality and accessibility of information on the NHS website so that women could make informed choices about their own health. Under our leadership, women's health hubs were launched with a clear mandate to exist in every integrated care system, bringing services closer to communities and breaking down barriers to care. We also ensured the creation of specialist mesh centres across England, delivering multidisciplinary, regionally-based care for women facing the severe consequences of surgical complications. At a recent roundtable I attended with lecturers from Bath University on mesh, Primodos and valproate, it was clear that there is still more work to do to support these women and to learn from the past. I thank the hon. Members for Wolverhampton West (Warinder Juss) and for Harlow (Chris Vince) for raising the mesh scandal so passionately earlier. On incontinence, the Conservative Government backed National Institute for Health and Care Research funding for vital research into patient-reported outcome measures, empowering patients, improving clinical care and ensuring that the lived experience is properly reflected in decision making. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (John Cooper) so powerfully elucidated earlier, men are often forgotten in this area. On the Opposition Benches, we support any culture and any steps that will help men with incontinence. As the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) mentioned, we men are pretty poor at going for diagnosis and treatment, and that needs to change. The scale of the issue remains significant. Nearly half of women experience incontinence after childbirth and one in 10 experience faecal incontinence, yet only 17% seek help. That is often because they are told subtly or directly that it is simply part of ageing or the price of motherhood. That attitude was unacceptable then and must not be tolerated now. When a third of women suffer pelvic floor disorders after giving birth and still face barriers to care, when men living with incontinence are afraid to leave their homes, and when people are forced to depend on charities for access to basic hygiene products, it is clear that we have a public health problem that transcends mere inconvenience. Will the Department commit to publishing an updated ""Excellence in Continence Care"" strategy this year, with clear timelines and accountability? Will we see dedicated funding to expand women's health hubs further, so that continence care is a core service, not a bolt-on? Will the Minister also bring forward a plan for better health services for male incontinence? Will NHS England guarantee national consistency of access to continence services and products, ending the unacceptable postcode lottery? Will the Government protect and grow funding for continence research to improve treatments for men and women? Finally, I pay tribute to the organisations, including Bladder and Bowel UK, Prostate Cancer UK and the Urology Foundation, that are breaking taboos and  supporting patients so tirelessly, but it is not their responsibility alone; the Government must lead. We Conservatives made a start, and we now need the current Government to have the same urgency, ambition and delivery to ensure that these hard-won improvements are built upon so that no one is left to struggle in silence."
"At a recent roundtable on violence against women and girls hosted by the Mayor of West Yorkshire, we heard from local organisations that do outstanding work but are hampered by short-term funding, as well as from a brave survivor who shared her experiences. They specifically asked for the Government to commit to strategic investment. Will the Minister review contracts with the sector so they are multi-year and take a long-term view of service delivery and preventive work?"
"I appreciate that, as Minister of State, my hon. Friend is limited in what he can say from the Dispatch Box, but will he convey back to the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister the extreme disquiet and unease across the House, particularly on the Labour Benches, about the position the Government are adopting? Will he ask the Prime Minister to come back next week to update the Government's position, tell us that more sanctions will be considered and that the recognition of the Palestinian state is also now on the agenda and will be forwarded?"
"Order. I say to those on the Opposition Front Bench that the statement has only just started. You might not be interested, but I know my constituents are. I expect the same courtesy when you speak."
"As a south-west region MP, does the Secretary of State agree that the west country has for decades been the poor country cousin of our rail network, and that money spent on HS2 is money not spent elsewhere? Will she do all in her power to ensure that the relatively small changes that are necessary on the network in the  south-west to make life a lot easier go ahead, and will she look particularly at the absolutely woeful west of England line?"
"I rise today along with my colleague, Representative Adam Gray, to honor the incredible life of Albert Eugene Bardini, a true representative of the spirit of the Central Valley. Albert Bardini was born on June 20, 1928, in Merced, California, to Pete and Adelaide Bardini, a proud third-generation farming family. He attended Merced High School, where he played both baseball and football. Following high school, he attended St. Mary's College before enlisting in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War. During this time, Albert married the love of his life, Joanne McKim on June 25, 1950, whom he had met during high school at the Hopeton Festa. Together, they made Merced their lifelong home. After his service, Albert and his two uncles established Bardini's Yosemite Suppliers--the first wholesale plumbing and electrical supply company in Merced. The business was a trailblazer, becoming the first private company awarded a contract by the Department of Defense to operate a supply store on a U.S. Air Force base. After selling the business, Albert continued his commitment to public service by becoming a Merced County Supervisor. In that role, he worked tirelessly on public works and community development projects, from water infrastructure to programs supporting seniors and youth. He was appointed to numerous state and local committees, a testament to the trust and confidence others placed in his leadership and vision. Albert was known to all for his vibrant personality and generosity. A longtime member of the Merced Elks Club and Breakfast Lions, he was also a dedicated Life Member of the Italo-American Lodge. His grandfather served as the first president of the Lodge in 1933, and Albert carried on that legacy with pride. Together Joanne and Albert raised four sons, who all pursued careers in engineering. Their family has grown with the addition of grandchildren and great-grandchildren, bringing Albert and Joanne tremendous pride and joy. In his later years, Albert could always be found at the heart of family gatherings, settled into a comfortable chair, watching a game, sharing stories, and offering his sharp, humorous commentary. Albert was preceded in death by his beloved wife of 66 years, Joanne, and his parents, Pete and Adelaide Bardini. He leaves behind his four sons: Richard (Nancy), Randy (Agnes), Gary (Laura), and Greg (Danielle), along with nine grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Albert's life was one of service, joy, and family."
"Mr. Speaker, the offshore energy in Newfoundland and Labrador brings tremendous economic benefit to our province. It creates jobs, opportunity and prosperity for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. This sector has grown, with some of the strongest environmental protections in the world, ensuring economic growth alongside a healthy environment. What is the view of the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources on the development of offshore energy in Newfoundland and Labrador?"
"Mr. Speaker, I never said that we did not like the tax break. I said that it did very little for the constituents of Miramichi—Grand Lake. What I am saying is this: If the government wants to take care of the people of Canada, it should cut the carbon tax completely."
"I am always grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. It is. Perhaps he did not hear me make that point earlier, but I specifically said that one of the reasons for the Bill was to prevent someone who is outside the UK, and who poses a risk to our national security, from returning when a further appeal may be upheld by the Home Secretary's decision. He is right: that is a potential scenario that we have to guard against, and the Bill will enable us to do that, just as Governments could prior to the ruling of the Supreme Court. I hope he finds that reassuring. As I set out, deprivation is one of the most powerful tools we have in our ongoing efforts to protect the United Kingdom and its citizens from harm. For it to remain an effective part of our armoury, we need to legislate. Before I finish, I pay tribute to our world-class law enforcement and intelligence agencies. In turbulent and uncertain times, their tireless work to maintain stability and security at home has never been more crucial. They must be supported at every turn, because the safety of our country stands apart from everything else we do. It is the cornerstone of our society, and ensuring that safety is the primary purpose of everyone involved in public service, including in this House. It is a responsibility borne not just by those of us on the Government Benches, but by parliamentarians of all parties. In that spirit, I urge Members to support the Bill, which is required to preserve our national security. I commend it wholeheartedly to the House."
I am not going to give way again to the right hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Wendy Morton). I will give way to the hon. Member for North Herefordshire.
"Madam Speaker, as wildfires force tens of thousands to evacuate their homes, criminals are taking advantage of the situation to loot homes and businesses and steal emergency equipment needed to fight the flames. In Redwater, a man was arrested for tampering with sprinkler equipment during the fire, and in Yellowhead County, emergency equipment was stolen. The RCMP is saying that this is the work of repeat offenders. This is happening across the country. When will the Liberals finally get serious about protecting our communities and crack down on these thugs?"
What steps he is taking to support rooftop solar power projects
"It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Bournemouth East (Tom Hayes). That was an important speech and I concur entirely with his priority there. It is really important that we invest in the social infrastructure of play for the benefit of children, although not necessarily for the benefit of Ed Balls and Andy Burnham--an appalling image was conjured by the hon. Gentleman there--but I concur with his general point. I want to speak in support of my new clause 87, which would require the Government to designate more chalk streams as protected sites within six months of the Bill passing. We know that 85% of the world's chalk streams are in this country. There are only 220 of them, so they are a rare and very special habitat. Most of those chalk streams are in southern England, and I am glad to say that most of the most important ones are in Wiltshire. Morgan's Hill on the edge of my constituency is a hydrological dividing line where a drop of rain can end up in the River Kennet and then the Thames, flowing out to the North sea. Alternatively it can go down the Hampshire Avon into the English channel, or it can go out west along the Bristol Avon and end up in the Atlantic. This is a very significant place, with water from Wiltshire flowing through the whole of southern England. Those chalk streams are 60 million years old and they have flowed clear and clean all that time until very recently in the modern era. They are over-abstracted; too much water is being taken out because of overdevelopment and bad house building. They are contaminated with agricultural run-off and, of course, sewage spills. I pay tribute and give my sincere congratulations to all the campaigners in my constituency. We will all have similar organisations locally, but Action for the River Kennet in particular is doing great work to support that river and anglers, schools and farmers in our area. I also pay tribute to the Southern Streams initiative that supports farmers across Wiltshire to restore the health of the soil and the water in our area. The last Government introduced some important new measures to restore and preserve the health of our chalk streams. These included the water restoration fund, which ensured that the fines levied on water companies for sewage spills went to restore nature in the areas that had been harmed. We introduced a storm overflow discharge reduction plan, stewardship schemes that addressed the question of agricultural run-off and, in the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023, we ensured that chalk streams were considered as part of environmental assessments for new developments. We also introduced the chalk streams recovery plan, which was sadly halted by the Labour Government when they came into power last year. They kept some of our legacy, I am glad to say, but they have paused the sustainable farming incentive and I am afraid to say that we expect cuts to stewardship schemes in the spending review this week. Crucially, they scrapped the water restoration fund itself. Thames Water was fined over PS100 million last month because of sewage spills in our area. That money should have gone to supporting natural restoration in the Thames Valley area, including in Wiltshire. It has been taken by the Treasury. We do not know where that money will go. The Government have also scrapped the chalk stream recovery plan. My concern about the Bill, and why I tabled the amendment, is that it will put additional pressure on our chalk streams. Yes, we need new building--absolutely, that priority is right and what we need--and building in our backyard, but the backyard of Wiltshire is Swindon. We need to see more intense development in urban areas where the real demand for housing is. That will be a great blessing to Swindon and Wiltshire if we can make that happen. The new clause in my name would protect more chalk streams as protected sites. I am glad to say that the Kennet and the Hampshire Avon are already SSSIs, but we need to see more streams designated in that way. It is not enough to protect only 11 of the 220 chalk streams in this country; the more designations, the better. That would create genuine momentum behind the preservation of chalk streams, so that when developments are being considered, we can be sure that these vital national natural assets are properly protected for the future."
"I thank the hon. Member for, I think, welcoming the nearly PS1 billion of investment in transport for the west of England, which we know is a thriving part of the country. With the right investment in affordable housing, clean, renewable transport that works on time and is affordable to use will be great for people living in her constituency and mine, and great for the country. One point to note is that the funding announced today is capital investment, not day-to-day spending. There will be further announcements in the coming weeks from the Department for Transport about issues such as bus subsidy and rail subsidy, but we are absolutely committed to supporting funding within regional combined authorities. This is not about particular places; that is why we have given this money to mayors, who will work with Members of Parliament like me and the hon. Member to ensure that we are delivering for the west of England and for the country."
"Before I recognize the government House leader, I want to point out that the word the member used causes a commotion when it is used in the House. I would therefore ask the member to withdraw that word."
"Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Milton East—Halton Hills South for her speech, and I congratulate her on her election. She did a good job explaining the recount she went through and the stress it caused. I congratulate her. In her case, it seems to have ended well. This is a matter of democracy. She said that every vote counts. What does she think about the problems in other ridings, such as Nunavik? They say that every vote counts, but offices are closing before the usual time set by Elections Canada. That is what happened in Nunavik, for example. What does she think about the case of Terrebonne? Elections Canada made a mistake with the return envelope. The election depended on one vote. It is all well and good to say that every vote counts, but everyone must get a vote. What does she think about this democratic issue that happened in some ridings?"
"Mr. Chair, I like that answer. What remains to be seen is how soon we can expect to see the money. Will it come from existing funds? Will we see it in a future budget or perhaps even sooner?"
"Mr. Speaker, the Liberal government's own housing agency has given up on the concept of housing affordability. It reported that Canada needs to build 480,000 homes a year to restore affordability, something TD Bank says is impossible. Earlier this week, the latest housing minister boasted that he was on pace for 280,000 starts this year, and he plans for 500,000 a year. In the GTA and the Lower Mainland, the bulk of our housing market starts have gone off a cliff, so the question is simple: If we are to take the minister at his word, where are the other 200,000 units coming from?"
"I am glad to see the Government starting to tackle some of these issues. Will the Minister assure me that people on freehold housing estates with covenant issues in places like Basildon and Billericay will also be included  in any legislation? They often face service charge increases of tens of per cent every single year, and they need that same assurance being provided to leaseholders that the Government will think about that and take action."
"The Government recognise the need to expand and upskill the construction workforce to meet our ambitious plan-for-change milestone of delivering 1.5 million safe and decent homes in this Parliament. We are working closely with industry to provide high-quality house building training opportunities, and we welcome the PS140 million industry investment late last year in 32 pioneering new home building skills hubs, which will create up to 5,000 more construction apprenticeships per year."
"We will never discuss Members' security on the Floor of the House. If there are issues, Members should please come to see me privately. Let me see what I can do to reassure Members, but I certainly do not want to open a debate, because I do not think that that would add to Members' safety. Please come and see me privately."
"Madam Speaker, I fully agree with my colleague's point. This is what I tried to highlight. For rural Canadians, it is just not an option. He specifically targeted farmers and those driving pickup trucks. I have been driving a pickup truck since 1997. I am never going to own a vehicle other than a pickup truck as my primary vehicle, because it is essential for living on a small farm and getting around to do what I need to do. Would I like to buy an electric vehicle or have another option, or maybe even a hybrid? I looked at it, but even though I do well, I cannot afford to buy even a used hybrid right now if I found one on the market. Again, I am somebody who is doing okay. There are so many Canadians whose vehicles turn into being the second-largest cost for them. We need to make it affordable before we actually mandate it on all Canadians."
"Mr. Chair, I would like to go back to my colleague's question and what I said, that no department, no official should discriminate against anyone. There is no place for discrimination in Canada. In regard to indigenous services, the 2025-26 main estimates include $25.3 billion in planned spending for Indigenous Services Canada, reflecting a $4.3-billion increase in voted funding to advance—"
moved that the bill be read the third time and passed.
Agreed.
"The Conservatives continually vote against the measures that we are taking to smash the gangs. We are getting on with the job, working internationally to disrupt the abhorrent work of these smugglers and gangs, while the hon. Member harps on from the sidelines. He should apologise for their record in government, which was abysmal."
"It is a great privilege to speak today to mark Armed Forces Day 2025--a moment for our country to show its deep and enduring gratitude to all the men and women who serve and have served in our armed forces. Their service underpins our national security, our values and our way of life. Whether it is on the frontline or behind the scenes, at home or abroad, those individuals commit themselves fully to something far greater than themselves, and they do so not for recognition but out of duty. Since becoming the Member of Parliament for Mansfield, I have had the opportunity to meet veterans, serving personnel and their families. I have seen at first hand the  strength of character, discipline and resilience that military life builds. It is clear that those who serve bring with them skills that enrich every part of our society once they return to civilian life, but we must be honest about the reality that many of them face after service. By its very nature, military life is unique. It often means frequent moves, long separations from family and sudden transitions. Although the vast majority of veterans make successful moves into civilian life, there are still far too many who encounter disadvantage, whether in housing, employment, access to healthcare or mental health services and so forth."
"Harry, a constituent of mine, is suffering from cancer. He has just finished gruelling chemotherapy and he now needs radiotherapy. He has been offered radiotherapy 170 miles away from where he lives. He has been told that he needs to pay for his transport and the accommodation for himself and his family during the treatment that has been offered. That is at the same time as the Rutherford centre, a state-of-the-art cancer treatment centre that is a stone's throw away from where Harry lives, has been closed for a number of years. Will the Leader of the House agree to a debate in Government time on how the NHS and the Government can come together to ensure that that fantastic facility can be used in the best interests of people in the region?"
"Senate Republicans are continuing to work on a reconciliation bill that makes America stronger and more prosperous. An important component of this bill is what it does on energy. Republicans spent a lot of time last year talking about how the Biden administration's hostility to conventional energy production was putting America on a dangerous trajectory in the future, and we promised that we would work to unleash American energy dominance, if we were put in charge. We have been working to deliver on that promise since January, and that work continues with the reconciliation bill that we will take up this month. Energy is essential. Without a reliable energy supply, our homes, schools, hospitals, businesses, factories--and our entire country-- literally, would grind to a halt. It is the critical resource, and we can't afford to get it wrong. But the Biden administration took us down the wrong path. It restricted development of America's conventional energy resources. It imposed regulations that heaped new burdens and costs on conventional energy producers, and it implemented an electric vehicle mandate that would have put an enormous new strain on our already wobbly electric grid. The United States is rapidly heading toward an energy crisis where we simply don't have the supply to meet thedemand. As the Washington Post noted last March, ``vast swaths of the United States are at risk of running short of power as electricity- hungry data centers and clean-technology factories proliferate around the country, leaving utilities and regulators grasping for credible plans to expand the nation's creaking power grid.'' Meanwhile, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation warned of ``mounting resource adequacy challenges'' in the next decade. That is a pretty serious situation, but, fortunately, we can do something about it. We have an abundance of natural resources, from the Gulf of America to the North Slope of Alaska. The Biden administration seemed to view those resources as a liability, but Republicans recognize these resources as the assets that they are, and our reconciliation bill will help unleash these resources to promote a stable, secure, and affordable energy supply. It will open up leases on America's lands and waters for responsible conventional energy development. It will expand production opportunities for essential energy resources that the Biden administration tried to put on the sidelines. As I indicated earlier, leveraging our natural resources through the reconciliation bill is just one part of the Republicans' energy agenda. For the last several months, we have been hard at work eliminating burdensome regulations that threatened to stifle energy development in our country. We blocked implementation of the Biden natural gas tax, which would have driven up energy prices and destroyed jobs in the energy sector. And we intend to do away with this misguided tax in the reconciliation bill that we will be considering soon. We have also repealed Biden-era energy regulations for household appliances and business equipment--regulations that would have driven up costs and reduced choice, with little environmental benefit. And the House and Senate moved to prevent California from imposing a de facto electric vehicle mandate on the whole country. The Biden administration sought to tie up American energy, but under the Trump administration and a Republican Congress, that era is over. Instead of a Green New Deal, we are giving a green light to energy producers. We are allowing Americans to benefit from our country's resources, and we are working to ensure a secure, reliable, and affordable energy supply for the long term. Mr. President, our reconciliation bill will help put us on the path to that secure energy future. I look forward to taking it up later this month. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
"Immigration is at a record level on the Home Secretary's watch, but as usual she does not answer the question or take responsibility. Let me try this instead: it emerged yesterday that the Attorney General, Lord Hermer, chose not to refer for a longer sentence under the unduly lenient sentencing scheme--as the Attorney General can--a man who had been given just 28 months for rape, yet Lucy Connolly got more prison time for a tasteless tweet. Why does Lord Hermer think rape is less serious than Twitter comments? This is two-tier justice in action. Does this not show that Lord Hermer has appalling judgment and the Prime Minister should fire him?"
"We continue to consider the ICJ's advisory opinion with the seriousness that it deserves. I want to reassure the House that the powers of the Foreign Office are not set by our views on an advisory opinion, which is just that: advisory. We abide by international law in all that we do and our options are not constrained by the fact that we have not yet pronounced a view on the advisory opinion."
"The industrial strategy rightly recognises the role of ceramics as a key foundational industry and, of course, the central role of Stoke-on-Trent not just historically but in the exciting new world of advanced ceramics--providing parts for wind turbines and even small modular reactors, if we get the investment our way. As the Secretary of State has mentioned, ceramics has the additional challenge of being a gas-intensive industry. As such, I welcome the Government's commitment to the energy-intensive industries compensation scheme--a snappier name would be nicer--particularly in supporting decarbonisation and technological innovation. May I ask the Secretary of State what specific support is planned to aid the ceramics industry, not only in managing its energy costs but in supporting its decarbonisation?"
"Mr. Speaker, Quebec has already passed legislation on zero-emission vehicles. We did not wait for the federal government. When it comes to the energy transition, Quebec very rarely waits for the federal government. What I find offensive, however, is the billions of Quebec dollars being funnelled to the oil and gas industry. We paid $34 billion for a pipeline. Between 2024 and 2030—"
"Mr. Chair, I will be splitting my time three ways. What percentage of pre-qualified IT contractors have no technical abilities, like the admitted fraudsters at the two-man, basement-headquartered GC Strategies?"
"I rise to honor the retirement of Captain Daniel Regan of the Covina Police Department. He was promoted to captain in 2022 and managed the Investigations, K9, Firearms, and Records units. As a well-distinguished and awarded police officer, Captain Regan's 35-year-long career exemplifies true service and sacrifice. He has defined what it means to protect and serve our community. Mr. Speaker, I thank him for all he has done to keep our families and our communities safe. I congratulate him on his well-deserved retirement and we wish him all the best.  Commending Glendora and San Dimas High School's Varsity Baseball Teams"
"I would like to speak briefly to the issue of live facial recognition and new clauses 21 and 22 in my name. New clause 21 calls for a ban on live facial recognition because it is not safe, lacks legal legitimacy and is an attack on the fundamental democratic rights of the British people. It is the choice of authoritarian states and dictators and should have no place in British policing, which I remind the Minister is still by consent. The technology is not safe. It was described by the Court of Appeal as ""novel and controversial"". Academics have shown that the technology makes mistakes in the recognition of darker-skinned women in 21% to 35% of cases, yet 99% of light-skinned men were identified correctly. Caucasian females are also not safe--just ask Danielle Horan, who was escorted out of not one but two Home Bargains stores due to an apparent facial recognition mix-up. It is no wonder that the Court of Appeal, in striking down the south Wales experiment, ruled it a breach of public sector equalities duties in failing to recognise possible bias in the algorithms. Facial recognition lacks legal legitimacy by operating under vague common law powers, unlike DNA or fingerprints. It is also an attack on hard-won democratic rights, undermining the principle that people should not be forced to identify themselves to police without suspicion. It has been used to monitor protesters, thus deterring lawful participation and threatening free assembly, which are some of our most important and enshrined civil liberties. Just ask the protesters picked up in Russia's underground train stations or protesters and Uyghurs in China. The Government must think again. New clause 22 calls for broader safeguards on automated decision making to ensure that law enforcement does not solely rely on AI algorithms and that there is always human review of its use. The new clause also calls for transparency, for the rights of people both to know what information is held about them and to contest decisions made by any AI, and to stop abuse by putting in the necessary checks. Those checks must meet high global standards, recommended by human rights organisations, and the best practice standards of our neighbours in the EU. Without human safeguards, the Government are  ushering in a ""Minority Report"" world--a potential dystopia where the computer simply says no and there is nothing we as individuals can do about it. Unamended, the Bill is dangerous and intrusive and breaks the fundamental contract between the British people and the police, along with the fundamental right to be considered innocent until proven otherwise. For those who think that that will never happen here, please take a look across the Atlantic. It certainly can happen here. It is time for the Government to admit that they have got this wrong. It is a sign of a strong, not a weak, Government if they listen to the evidence and change course as a result. Live facial recognition is not the answer and will cause more problems than it claims to solve. It needs to go."
"I welcome today's announcement. It is right that, despite the horrendous financial situation that this Government inherited from the Conservative party, they are reinstating the winter fuel payment for 75% of pensioners and specifically targeting those in the most need. Following the question from my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire South (Johanna Baxter), will the Minister outline what discussions he expects to have with Scottish Ministers about the Scottish Government's universal approach to winter fuel payments in Scotland? At a time when public services in Scotland are facing significant peril, the SNP's position is to continue to give winter fuel payments to millionaires at a time of deep hardship for people in Scotland."
"I beg to move, That this House has considered the distribution of SEND funding. I am delighted to have secured this debate, as it gives us an opportunity to highlight the situation we are facing in England, where children with special educational needs and disabilities are being left behind due to the inherent regional inequality in the high-needs national funding formula. There is a bigger issue. The more typical thing we talk about is the overall quantum of spending based on overall need, but too little attention is given to the distribution of the funding that exists, whether in healthcare, education, policing or otherwise. I know I am not the only Member being turned to by constituents at their wits' end, trying to navigate what feels to be a broken system; I thank colleagues across the House for their continued advocacy on behalf of some of the most vulnerable children in all our communities. My argument is a simple yet deeply important one: the current model of SEND funding is not only inconsistent but in too many cases profoundly unfair. It fails to account for genuine levels of need, the realities faced by families, and the systemic pressures that schools and local authorities are under. Unless that changes, we will continue to fail children who rely on Members to make their case and to get this right."
"I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time."
"With a birthday contribution, I call Alex Mayer."
"Mr. Speaker, the answer is clear. If Canada wants to be an energy superpower, we need to do it in a smart way, and that is to make sure it is low-risk, low-cost and low-carbon. The Conservatives were unable to build anything because they did not do environmental assessments and they did not consult with indigenous peoples. We are not going to follow the way they did things, because that did not get things done. We are going to get things done right."
"Mr. Speaker, I am also tabling a petition on behalf of the peace trainers from my riding, from Parksville, Denman Island, Courtenay, Port Alberni and Bamfield. The petitioners cite that the lack of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms is the underlying cause of violent conflict. They highlight that an open society and an informed public and Parliament are essential for the understanding of complex issues of violent conflict and for the achievement of lasting peace and disarmament. With the closing of the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre, Canada lost an important civilian-led, independent institutional structure that supported effective research policy and training in peace operations and conflict resolution. The petitioners are calling on the House of Commons to establish and fund a centre of excellence for peace and justice focused on research, education and training in conflict resolution, diplomacy and peace operations for Canadian civilians, police, military personnel and the international community."
"Mr. Speaker, it is truly amazing that the member stands up with a speech that is literally riddled with conspiracy theories from all extremes. She gives the impression that we are going to have Canada Post workers opening up every envelope. She is saying, “Canadians, be aware that this is going to happen,” as though she is giving a warning to every Canadian. She needs to get a grip on real life. Even the Canadian Police Association has come out saying this is good legislation, and it is looking forward to seeing it pass. The member criticizes and attacks the Minister of Immigration , but she was there when Stephen Harper and Jason Kenney cancelled the parents sponsorship program, not to mention their deleting hundreds of thousands of files that were under process. They had a broken system, too. At least we are trying to balance it. When will the member get real?"
"Madam Speaker, I will have to reread what was actually said. My understanding of what I said was that the members are either completely unaware of what they are saying, or they are unintentionally misleading the House. There is an option. I am not accusing them of intentionally misleading the House. Now—"
"Mr. Speaker, Canada's crime rate is up. Homicide is up 28%, violent crime is up 50% and extortion is up 357%. This week, CSIS reported foreign governments are using organized criminal networks to target Canadians. Our own intelligence agency is sounding the alarm, but the Liberals are ignoring it. They voted against Conservative Bill C-381 , which was for jail, not bail, for repeat offenders. Will the Prime Minister finally take public safety seriously by adopting our Conservative plan to lock up these violent criminals?"
"The hon. Lady is correct that if a woman got the tablets at a clinic, she could give them to somebody else, but in order to get them in the first place she would need to be 10 weeks pregnant, and the clinician would check that she was pregnant. When the medication appears not to have worked, questions would perhaps be asked about where the tablets had gone, so I think there is an inherent safety feature there. The hon. Lady brings up the issue of bus routes. That is important, but the question is whether we should improve the bus routes or make medical services less safe. Most clinical services are accessed by individuals attending hospitals or clinics, and in some respects this instance is no different, because it is important that proper medical checks are done. I am not trying to limit people's access to what is clinically legally available. I am trying to make sure that people are safe when they do so. I want to turn to women who have been trafficked or are being forced into sex work. We talked yesterday in the House about young girls who had been groomed and raped in the grooming gangs scandal. Would we put it past those evil, nasty men to have got drugs and given them to these young girls to hide the evidence of their crimes? I would not. What about those who want to preserve the honour of their family by preventing their daughter from being pregnant? What about those who think that the baby being carried by their partner is of the wrong gender--they would like a boy but are having a girl? What about those who are trying to cover up sexual abuse, particularly of teenagers and young girls, by causing a termination to hide the evidence of their crimes? What if a partner does not want a baby? Stuart Worby got caught, was prosecuted and is rightly in jail, but how many others have done that and not got caught? We simply will never know. No one knows who is taking these medications. If we have proper clinics, gestation can be checked, a clinician can ascertain more effectively if a woman is being coerced, and they can make the abortion medically as safe as possible. My amendment is not pro-life or pro-choice. It is pro-safety."
"I recently visited a NATO air force base in Poland as part of the armed forces parliamentary scheme I am taking part in with the RAF. There, I saw at first hand the importance of working closely with our NATO allies to defend our nation and keep us secure, as we witnessed the scramble to the skies to ward off Russian fighter jets. Will the Prime Minister confirm that he is prioritising the wellbeing of our armed forces personnel, both at home and abroad, so that they can continue to keep us and our allies safe?"
"I congratulate the hon. Member for Horsham (John Milne) on securing this debate and on his thoughtful and informed speech. I thank all Members for raising this incredibly important issue. Let me reassure them and this House that the Government appreciate all the concerns that have been raised. There is no complacency, and we are taking a responsible approach to the deployment of grid-scale batteries, which are an essential part of delivering clean energy. We are very clear that increasing the amount of clean, renewable electricity generated, stored and used in the UK will improve our energy security. It will bring down bills for consumers in the long term by reducing our reliance on fossil fuel markets, which are volatile. It will create jobs, and it will tackle the climate and nature crisis, which we must do for future generations. We are committed to delivering clean power by 2030, and it was reassuring to hear support for that ambition from Members across the House, with the disappointing exception of the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Nick Timothy), who has adopted a pretty impressive skill of rewriting history and forgetting his own Government's shoddy legacy on this. In the clean power action plan, the Government outlined that 23 GW to 27 GW of grid-scale battery storage could be required by 2030. I understand that many Members here today are concerned that this comes at the expense of health and safety, but let me reassure them that that is absolutely not the case. I acknowledge that there have been a number of incidents at battery sites, in 2025 in particular, and this has raised legitimate concerns. We hear those concerns and understand them, and Members are right to raise them with Government. However, it is incredibly important for me to stress--and reiterate a point that has been made by other Members--that the risks associated with grid-scale batteries are relatively small and well understood, that there are robust measures in place for managing those risks, and that Government are already taking further steps to address some of the issues that have been raised."
"Mr. Chair, how many of them have voluntarily left?"
"During Operation Banner, every single time a paramilitary was killed by a British soldier, it was subject to judicial investigation. The Director of Public Prosecutions went through the evidence at the time, interviewed people, looked at the planning documents and was able to talk to people contemporaneously while they could still remember it. It was not a rubber stamp; it was rigorous, as was proven by the fact that, where necessary, it led to prosecution. What is happening now is double jeopardy. Worse still, it is double jeopardy under new rules but with no new evidence. Indeed, there is a risk of lost evidence and lost memory, given the passage of time. I have heard what the Secretary of State has said, but will he commit to ensuring that soldiers who were subject to reviews at the time will not be subject to further risk of prosecution under the Government's replacement for the legacy Act?"
"Mr. Speaker, let me start by again offering my congratulations to the hon. minister. We are very proud of her in Nova Scotia, and the Nova Scotia members of Parliament who sit in the Nova Scotia caucus. I know we have not shared our time, but I wonder if she could provide a bit of reflection on her Lebanese heritage, her story and what it means to be the Minister of Immigration."
"Madam Speaker, I appreciate your indulgences in a new House with new members who are just learning the ropes. We talked about range anxiety with EVs a lot in the debate, but grid anxiety is something that is emerging. Blackouts all over the world, not just in Alberta and western Canada, are showing that the combination of different input sources to electricity are not balanced, and we have not quite gotten that figured out yet. If we just add more and more demand to the grid, we know, by projections, that the grid will be 50% too small for any projected use. It is a 30-year project at least to get the grid up to some sort of scale that will handle the load that is anticipated by this. There is a lot of grid anxiety."
"I thank the Minister for her statement and her answers. In the short time she has been in her role, she has always delivered good news, and that is quite a talent, so I say well done and I thank the Government for that. Double the number of households in the United Kingdom will get PS150 off their energy bills, and that is very welcome for those on means-tested benefits. However, with one in four children living in poverty in Northern Ireland, it is essential that this announcement applies in Northern Ireland too. Will the Minister confirm that Northern Ireland is included in this help for the vulnerable and those in poverty? Will it come through Barnett consequentials or another way?"
"Madam Speaker, I would like to inform you that I will be sharing my time with the Secretary of State for Combatting Crime . During the election campaign, Canadians across the country asked us to take concrete measures to build a safer Canada. We have heard them, and we take the issues of protecting our borders and cracking down on crime very seriously. That is why, at the beginning of this new Parliament, we introduced Bill C‑2 , the strong borders act. I would like to congratulate my colleague, the Minister of Public Safety , who sponsored this bill, as well as all my other ministerial colleagues who contributed to it, for the quality of their work on this important issue for Canadians. Over the next few minutes, I will explain why I support this essential bill, which will enable us to advance our government's priorities of keeping Canadians safe by strengthening Canada's border, fighting transnational organized crime and improving the integrity of Canada's immigration system. The first objective of this bill is to make our border more secure. This is an especially important issue for me as the member for Madawaska—Restigouche, a riding with five border crossings. I want to point out that Canada's borders are already strong and secure and that CBSA staff do remarkable work. I want to commend them for the work they do every day to protect our borders. During the election campaign, I had the opportunity to meet many of these border services officers at various community activities in my riding and discuss their important work with them. Through Bill C‑2 , we will make our borders even stronger. We will do that by making it easier for border officers to examine goods destined for export that are crossing the border and to intercept more drugs, guns and stolen vehicles as they leave Canada. For example, border officers will have more power to inspect containers destined for export and prevent car theft rings from smuggling stolen vehicles out of the country. During the election campaign, I heard many stories about stolen vehicles, like that of a young entrepreneurial couple from my riding, who work hard to earn a living and who, upon returning from vacation, found that their truck had disappeared from their hotel's long-term parking lot. We need to increase the responsible authorities' capacity to fight this type of crime. It is also important to understand that the strong borders act complements our other measures to strengthen our borders. Once passed, this legislation will strengthen Canada's border plan, which involves funding of $1.3 billion, the largest investment in border security in Canadian history. When we talk about strengthening our country's security, it is not just talk. We are taking real action. We are also taking important steps to preserve the integrity of our immigration system while honouring our humanitarian commitments. Canadians expect us to maintain a strong, effective immigration system well suited to present conditions. That is why we made changes to create two ineligibility measures in the asylum system. The goal is to reduce pressure on the system and deter those who may seek to abuse it. Let me reiterate, however, that we will do this while upholding our humanitarian traditions and ensuring that refugees who genuinely need protection can get it. The second objective of Bill C‑2 is to combat transnational organized crime and fentanyl. We understand that a strong Canada requires strong crime prevention measures. That is why we are taking steps to prevent crime, give police the tools they need to fight it, and hold criminals accountable for their actions. Opioids are wreaking havoc across the country. Thousands of lives are being lost; not a day goes by without hearing heartbreaking stories of lives cut short. We cannot remain indifferent to this situation, and we must act. That is why we will continue our efforts to stop the flow of fentanyl. In particular, we will further empower law enforcement agencies in the fight against the production and trafficking of illicit drugs. We will allow law enforcement agencies to search goods crossing the border. We will facilitate the listing of precursor chemicals in the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to prevent their importation and illegal use. We will also allow the police to search for, intercept and seize drugs and other prohibited items that are being shipped through the postal system. To that end, we will amend the Canada Post Corporation Act. This bill will also strengthen our ability to prosecute transnational child sex offenders. To do this, we are amending the Sex Offender Information Registration Act to improve the RCMP's ability to share information with its national and international partners. The third pillar of our bill is to stop illicit financing by strengthening our ability to fight money laundering and stop the flow of financial proceeds from organized crime to deprive it of its illegal profits. Our government was elected on a platform of protecting and defending Canadians from foreign threats, which includes protecting our financial system. We will therefore impose tougher penalties for financial crimes. We will also facilitate the exchange of information between Canada's largest banks and law enforcement agencies responsible for combatting money laundering, so that banks can receive and use the information sent to them by the RCMP. As such, Bill C-2 is an important step forward in implementing our plan to build a safer Canada. This bill strengthens law enforcement's ability to detect and investigate serious crimes, while respecting the rights guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the rule of law. It is important to stress that the amendments we are proposing have been carefully crafted to balance privacy interests with the tools law enforcement needs to fulfill their mandate. By implementing these rigorous measures, the Government of Canada will strengthen security at our borders while increasing safety in our communities. These measures will also show our international partners that Canada takes seriously our shared responsibility to combat fentanyl, car theft, human trafficking and transnational organized crime. In conclusion, protecting our borders and fighting crime and illicit financing are issues that transcend party lines. Canadians have high expectations of us. They expect us to work together with the seriousness that the issues we are addressing demand. Like all my colleagues on the government side, I will support this important bill. I hope that all other members of the House will work with us constructively to pass this bill, which is essential to making Canada stronger, safer and more secure."
"I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way; I want to support her in what she is saying. We are going through a process, as we consider the appalling situation of coercive control in domestic abuse cases, where a person who is a victim may not realise they have been a victim until years later. Obviously, a person who has gone through an assisted death will have no years later. Is the amendment not a way of making sure that we guard against the evil of coercive control?"
"Mr. Chair, I am focused on Canada, not on China. We will let the Chinese decide how they want to—"
"Madam Chair, would the member apologize to the children of Canada, including the children in his riding, for voting against a food program for children? When we make an allegation in this House, we have to be careful of the answer. He voted against a program to help children."
"Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House today. Since this is my first opportunity to give a speech in the House since the election, I want to thank the constituents of Foothills and the families in southern Alberta who once again elected me to represent them in the House of Commons. I am honoured that we received the second-highest number of votes in the country, almost 55,000. Only my colleague from Ponoka—Didsbury was able to surpass the wonderful people of Foothills. That certainly goes to show that our message as Conservatives standing up for Alberta resonates with my constituents in Foothills. I want to state that I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Cloverdale—Langley City . I welcome back to the House of Commons such an outstanding colleague here with me. As the Conservative shadow minister for agriculture and agri-food, it is my duty to stand here and represent and be the voice for the hard-working farmers and ranchers and producers right across this country, as well as for those Canadians who have gone to the grocery store shelves over the last few months and have questioned how this could possibly be getting worse. People are asking this because the Prime Minister stated emphatically that he would be judged by the prices at the grocery store shelves. The Prime Minister said that, not the opposition. By his own metrics, by the Prime Minister's own statement, he has failed Canadians. I admit that I rise today with some frustration, as certainly all of us in this House are hearing from our constituents who are frustrated with the price of groceries at the grocery store shelf, given the promises by the Liberal Prime Minister . It seems to us that they are the same old Liberals with the same old promises and the same old promises broken. The average family is now spending close to $1,000 more a year on groceries: close to $16,000. These prices continue to rise: oranges are up more than 20%; apples, 20%; beef, more than 30%; rice, 14%, and the list goes on and on. As a result, Canadians are having to make very difficult choices every single month when they do their household budgets. I would expect that Canadians would want the government to follow their lead and actually have a budget showing Canadians where their tax dollars are going and just how bad the fiscal situation that the Liberals have left us is. The Liberals are great at blaming someone else for their problems. The parliamentary secretary is still blaming COVID. I am sure the Liberals are going to be blaming Harper later today. However, the Prime Minister was the financial adviser for the previous prime minister, Trudeau, for more than five years. This is not a new group. The finance minister has been there for 10 years. The former finance minister has been there for 10 years. It is not like the Liberals do not have some data to go by. These are not new Liberals. However, despite the Liberals' refusal to table a budget, it is Canadians who are paying the price. They are paying the price at the grocery store shelf every single day. The current Prime Minister said during the election that he was going to be different. Clearly, in only a couple of months, he is different; I would say arguably worse. He said that he would keep spending increases at 2%, that he would cap that, but his first group of estimates shows that he has increased spending more than 8%, by half a trillion dollars in more deficit spending. At a time when inflation and food security are top of mind, the government is continuing to throw gas on the inflationary fire. Not only are the Liberals breaking these promises; they are shattering them with this type of spending, and they refuse to hold themselves accountable, with their policies driving up food costs. If anything, the policies they continue to want to implement and continue to champion would only make matters worse. Ideological policies like front-of-pack labelling, a P2 plastics ban, a tariff on fertilizer, fertilizer and crop protection reductions and industrial carbon tax will all make life more difficult for farmers, manufacturers, truckers and retailers. All those costs get passed down to the consumer at the grocery store shelf. I want to give a few examples of the incredible consequences these ideological policies will have on consumers. Michael Graydon, the CEO of Food, Health & Consumer Products of Canada, stated at the agriculture committee last year that the Liberals' nonsensical front-of-pack warning labels will cost the industry an additional $8 billion and that manufacturers will have no choice to pass on those additional costs to the consumers, driving up food prices at the grocery store. An in-depth report by Deloitte stated that the impact of the Liberals' P2 plastics ban on Canadian producers and produce growers will be catastrophic; it will increase the cost of produce another 35%. That is over and above the inflationary increases that we are already seeing as a result of the Liberals' out-of-control spending. It will reduce the availability of fresh produce by 50%. It will cost growers and producers more than $6 billion in additional costs. It will increase food waste by 50%. At a time when Canadians are wanting to support Canadian growers, Liberal policy is bankrupting Canadian producers. More than 44% of growers of fresh fruit and vegetables in Canada are already selling their products at a loss, and this is before the new ideological policies are being implemented."
"Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows full well that on this side of the House, our government has made and continues to make unprecedented investments in supporting farmers and the agricultural sector. As for his part of the country, we appreciate the work the farmers in his riding do and those riding tractors and other important pieces of equipment who are helping to bring food to the table. We continue to support those sectors, and we are going to continue to work hard with them to ensure that over the course of time, we do the best we can to ensure they can produce food in the way that is most sustainable for the future."
And it is being decommissioned--that is even worse!
"Mr. Chair, there is still no IIO representing the BIPOC community despite the fact that its members are disproportionately killed at the hands of police. Is the minister going to address that?"
"Everyone should want not just to get to the truth about past failures, but to ensure we make the changes to protect children for the future. That includes changes in social services; changes in policing and the police operation, which I hope the right hon. Lady would welcome, to take action to put perpetrators behind bars; and action to gather proper ethnicity data, which simply has not been gathered properly before. Louise Casey's report is very clear: the data gathering that the right hon. Lady's Government left behind is totally inadequate. I hope she will agree to all those factors being extremely important, so that we can get stronger protection, and truth, for victims."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The hon. member opposite referred to Canada's “new” government. That has been raised as a point of order."
"Mr. Speaker, my colleague's speech on this bill reminded me of a citizenship ceremony that took place a few years ago in Deux‑Montagnes, in my riding. When people get their citizenship, it is a very emotional moment. People are happy to become Canadians. What does my colleague think of this bill? Does he not think that it should be referred directly to committee?"
"Mr. Speaker, I think we all agree, at least on this side of the aisle, that this bill does not go far enough in a lot of its policies. I want to ask the member this. How does Bill C-4 address the multiple tent cities that have been created over the last 10 years in communities across Canada because of Liberal policies?"
"I welcome the enhanced environmental protections in the nature restoration fund. My constituency of Bournemouth West has some unique heathland habitats, many of which are protected as sites of special scientific interest. They hold deep value for the local community, so can the Minister reassure me that these unique habitats will be protected as well under this Bill?"
"Mr. Speaker, the point the member made is not in the bill. The bill would allow the Canada Post Corporation to access mail without going through a standard police warrant process, and that in itself is a problem for Canadians overall."
"Mr. Speaker, there will be a budget. In due time, that will be presented. In fact, it is much more responsible and much more important to take the time to do the budget, rather than rushing. The members opposite seem to suggest that we should have rushed into a budget. Let us take the time. Let us do it well and let us move on from there."
"Mr. Speaker, today I rise on behalf of all the Canadians who are feeling increasingly skeptical, disappointed and disillusioned with politics across the country. Scandals like the one raised by the Auditor General of Canada are good examples that fuel this feeling of discouragement. ArriveCAN, or “arrive scam”, as many call it, is a government program that was mismanaged. It is a perfect example of wasted public funds, favouritism and profound disrespect for people who work hard to earn a living, pay their mortgage, pay for groceries and transportation, and who pay their taxes respectfully and in good faith so that Canada can prosper. What do we really owe them? Let us keep in mind that the purpose of the app was to safeguard national security at a critical time in our recent history. The app was supposed to collect personal information, such as contact information, health status, proof of vaccination and even quarantine plans. The app was also supposed to track mandatory quarantines. It was a system of exchange between the government and our citizens. The app was supposed to speed up customs processes and security at our borders, enforce public health policies, limit the transmission of the virus and make it easier for our border officers to do their job. That is a lot. It was also meant to serve as a temporary vaccine passport. Some will say that there was a crisis, that it was a crucial time, that it was a matter of national security, and that the government should be given a free pass. I will say one thing: If someone's house is on fire and their first instinct is to call their brother-in-law who is a plumber or painter, that means that their instincts are bad and their priorities are out of whack. That is what happened. At a critical time, the government awarded contracts to a two-person company that did not even have the skills to do what was required. However, Canada has plenty of good, reliable and reputable companies. To name just a few, there is CGI, a great Montreal company with 95,000 employees; OpenText, a Waterloo company with 23,000 employees; and Constellation Software, a Toronto company with 56,000 employees. Perhaps the government wanted to support small businesses. Perhaps that was the objective. Here are a few of those: Cohere, a Toronto company with 300 employees; Appnovation, a Vancouver company with 402 employees; and Nexapp, a Quebec company with nearly 100 employees. However, the government chose that particularly intense and historic moment to do business with a two-person company, a shell company, despite the fact that Canada's contracting policies are extremely clear. There are six easy steps. First, assess needs. What is the goal? Analyze the risks, the options and the budget, which is still a problem, apparently. Next, issue a call for tenders to evaluate the most suitable companies. Once again, there are technical requirements, deadlines and a budget. Officials receive and assess costing, relevance, the company's experience—sorely lacking in this case—capacity for execution and conflicts of interest. Here again, a lot of these pieces were missing. Then, the government awards the contract to the company that offers the greatest benefit for Canadians, not for its cronies. Lastly, the government ensures delivery. It monitors the execution of the contract and pays when the product is delivered. There is no prepayment for something that has not been delivered. We are not talking about a mistake here. We are talking about a choice to govern with no rigour, respect, technical skills or transparency. They gave $60 million to a two-person company that did not have the required knowledge, reputation or respect of its peers in its field. It is clear proof of the government's total contempt for Canadians and Canadian families, who were struggling then and are still struggling today with inflated prices thanks to the inflationary policies of the past 10 years. We are still hearing excuses today in the House. The Liberals say that they put a stop to all that, and so on. However, this reminds me of an arsonist firefighter who lights fires, puts them out and then pats themselves on the back. Contracts are not awarded by just anyone. They are awarded by the government. It must have known exactly what it was doing. This is reminiscent of other Liberal scandals. Take, for example, the Aga Khan affair, involving the Christmas vacation of our former prime minister, who was ultimately the first Prime Minister to breach federal ethics rules. There was also the SNC‑Lavalin affair. Our former prime minister intervened directly with the Department of Justice to get a deal for a company that had donated money to his election campaign. Think of the WE Charity scandal, where the Liberals entrusted the management of the Canada student service grant, a $912‑million program, to an organization with ties to the Trudeau family. Another example from around the same time is the Frank Baylis affair. The former Liberal MP's company secured a $237‑million contract to supply ventilators, which was $100 million more than the cost of similar equipment available at the time. Think of ArriveCAN. This app was supposed to help Canadians travel while protecting the population from the potential spread of the virus, but it was a failure. The project was a money pit. More than anything, it became a symbol of gross mismanagement of public funds. The revelations speak for themselves: $100 million was pre-approved for a company with only two employees; $59 million was paid without any real traceability; $20 million was handed over for an app that did not even work; there was no certification process; 46% of the money was paid without any evidence of work being performed. GC Strategies, a two-person company, received contracts from 31 different departments. It got 106 contracts amounting to $92.7 million. When it comes to ArriveCAN, 177 versions were released without any prior testing. That resulted in 10,000 travellers being needlessly quarantined. They suffered lost wages and personal stress for no reason at all. Ethical rules were flouted, and the interests of Canadians were not protected. If we take a closer look at the history, the first contract was for $2.35 million. I personally contacted firms to see if that made sense. I was told it was far-fetched, but that the first contract was still plausible. In 2022, as the whole world was slowly emerging from the crisis, the government awarded GC Strategies a contract that was 10 times bigger, worth $25 million. GC Strategies' employees won the contract by taking part in creating the contract themselves. First they defined the bid criteria, then they submitted their own bid, and then they got the $25‑million contract. Here is another interesting fact: GCStrategies billed an extra 15% to 30% profit margin while subcontracting out the rest of the work. No one down the line was working at cost, without trying to make a profit. On average, tech firms expect to make a 15% to 20% profit from their activities. There were six different subcontractors. If we do the math, that means six people each charging a 15% to 20% profit, with another 15% to 30% profit layer on top of that. At that rate, the staggering costs come as no surprise. Canadians demand transparency, competency and a sense of responsibility. The sound management of public finances rests on three pillars: a transparent and competitive bidding process, strict monitoring of every dollar spent, and real, harsh penalties for anyone who recklessly squanders public funds. Our motion is clear. We are calling on the government to get taxpayers their money back within 100 days and ban companies like GCStrategies for life. I think we should also add that the people who participated in this wrongdoing should not be encouraged; they should be punished."
"Mr. Chair, what is his projection? Ordinarily, would the finance minister not have a deficit projection for the year-end 2026?"
"I rise to recognize Jordana Zubkoff for twenty years of outstanding service to this House in several administrative and support roles. She lives in Arlington, VA, and I am proud to represent her here in Congress. Ms. Zubkoff is retiring after having lent her talents and skills to the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) for over twenty years. She started in the Immediate Office for the CAO in 2004, and has also worked for the Finance Immediate Office, Budget Planning and Analysis, and finally in the Office of Payroll and Benefits, starting in 2013. Ms. Zubkoff has provided vast knowledge about payroll calculations and impeccable attention to detail; her reconciliations, tax calculations, and customer service in service to House offices and employees, has helped to ensure that their employees have been paid accurately while adhering to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and U.S. House of Representatives standards. Her expertise, experience, and courteous attentiveness enabled her to be an invaluable asset to the House of Representatives over the years. Ms. Zubkoff is well respected by her coworkers and colleagues.  Ms. Zubkoff is a big fan of traveling; she has gone on many trips over the years including Panama, Australia, and a surprise birthday cruise this year to South America. Her favorite souvenirs from these trips are jewelry made by regional artists with local materials. In her retirement, she plans to travel with her family, including her sister, niece, and nephew. I congratulate Ms. Zubkoff, and I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking her for her distinguished service to the House and the Nation it serves. I wish her all the best as she begins this new chapter in her life."
"Mr. Speaker, I said Canadians are supportive of ensuring that big polluters pay the price of polluting."
"Mr. Chair, my hon. colleague talks about an increase in the public service, but does not talk about an increase in the population. The public service is there to serve Canadians, to deliver priorities to Canadians and—"
"I praise the Prime Minister for his work on the new 5% target and on ensuring that we reach it for our national security and core defence. Does he agree that just as the Labour Government in the 1940s helped to found NATO, this Labour Government could help found a multilateral defence development bank that would ensure that we reach 5% by the mid-2030s?"
"Mr. Speaker, when we looked at the GC Strategies issue during the last Parliament, I remember us coming to the realization that these firms could easily change names to win other contracts. This is what happened with GC Strategies, which was initially called Coredal Systems Consulting. We realized that it had been hired by the Department of Transport between 2010 and 2015 under the Conservative government. Governments come and go and seem to repeat the same mistakes. This fuels public cynicism. What can be done today to address this? The solution would obviously be to repay the money, but beyond that, we must also ensure that this does not happen again in the future."
"I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend, and he is right to say that we should focus on the big changes we are making to support pensioners, which in England are rescuing the NHS and raising the basic and the new state pension."
"Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the principles of the question being posed. There are issues there that are very tangible. For example, one of the first initiatives was the tax break for Canadians, which I made reference to. I would think that the Conservatives would be onside and that we would not have a problem in passing that, but I do not take that for granted because the first time we attempted that was back in 2015, and members will recall that the Conservatives actually voted against that tax break. When I refer to working “onside”, the opposition can still be critical. Its members can still say that they want X, Y, and Z, but in terms of our delivering that tax break, I would think that the Conservative Party should actually vote in favour of it. On the legislation that would come before the House to take down some of these barriers, especially after consultation with the provinces, I would think the Conservatives would vote in favour of that also."
"We talk weekly in this place about Russia's illegal bombing of Ukraine. Russia may not be a close ally like the US, but presumably if international law applies to that, the US bombing of Iran would likewise be illegal under international law. If not, can the Foreign Secretary explain why international law would apply differently to the US? Where does that leave us if this conflict escalates in the region?"
"Job creation in Wales is vital, so what representations has the Secretary of State made on behalf of businesses in Wales and the rest of Great Britain, which are being forced not to supply businesses in Northern Ireland any more because of the outrageous and unnecessary parcel border in the Irish sea? What is she doing to right the wrongs of the ongoing damage of the protocol and the Windsor framework to our Union and our economy?"
"Madam Speaker, I disagree on a number of points, and I would like to ask a question afterward. It has been said that I am not proud. Fortunately, we Liberals are very proud to be Canadian and very proud to have been chosen by Canadians in the last election. Listening to my colleagues, I get the impression that the election campaign is still on, but it is over, and Canadians have made their choice. We have here an important and ambitious initiative. Would my colleague be willing to work with us to move this bill forward, a bill that will truly unify Canada and make its economy much stronger?"
"Madam Chair, the minister says it is false that a large part of the retaliatory measures against the U.S. tariffs have been suspended. Contrary to what Oxford Economics says, the Department of Finance has not submitted any documents and there is no evidence to support its claim. Does the minister think that publicly squabbling with consulting firms that are trying to help their clients contributes to predictability and a good business climate in Canada?"
"Mr. Chair, does the minister believe that this will be the number? Is that the number we can expect in the budget that has not been tabled yet?"
"Glasgow City football club in my constituency recently won 2-0 against Hearts, securing the team a place in the UEFA women's champions league. I was delighted to be at that game cheering the team on. It is a fantastic achievement and a testament to the hard work of the team on and off the pitch, spearheaded by club co-founder and chief executive Laura Montgomery. Will the Leader of the House join me in wishing Glasgow City the best of luck for their European campaign, and will she consider a debate in Government time on the importance of supporting grassroots women's football?"
"I thank the hon. Gentleman for his excellent question. I 100% agree with him about the role of community energy providers. I hope that he can persuade his Front Benchers to convert to supporting Great British Energy, because one of things that it will do--we will be happy to work with him on this--is unleash a wave of community energy across our country, doing precisely the things that he talks about."
"Mr. Speaker, we have seen no meaningful action taken on the part of the Liberals to get the money back. All we have seen, in fact, is the government's thumbing its nose at the will of the House of Commons, which ordered the government to recover all of the millions of dollars. As far as any proceedings go, no member on the other side of the aisle can cite the lawsuit, the amount sought and the parties named when—"
"I include in the Record the following newsletter to give an update to my constituents on debris removal after Hurricane Helene.  Dear Friend: There has been an important development regarding debris clean-up efforts from Hurricane Helene. After hearing from residents and stakeholders about improper debris removal, FEMA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) have agreed to improve oversight and precision in debris removal operations. The action plan moving forward is: Property owners are encouraged to mark debris areas of concern with a red flag. Flagged areas will not be disturbed until the property owner, the county, and USACE engage in a consultation. Counties will then make final decisions based on the need to protect downstream infrastructure while respecting private property. This agreement will help address the top concerns my team has heard from Western North Carolinians affected by debris removal by: Preventing the removal of more debris than necessary. Adequately protecting wildlife habitat. Ensuring landowners receive due consideration through the process. I believe this plan will increase the quality of clean-up efforts, and my office will continue to assess the debris removal process and listen to your concerns as we work together to return to normalcy as quickly as possible. For additional information on debris removal projects, visit my website. You will find maps that note areas where debris removal has been completed (marked in green) and plans for upcoming debris removal projects. With my warmest regards, Chuck Edwards, Member of Congress."
"I rise today with a heavy heart to honor Ava Moore, a tremendous young woman from the 24th Congressional District. She was a leader, a patriot, and a bright light in our north Texas community. From the first time that we reviewed her application to the U.S. Air Force Academy, it was clear that she was destined for greatness. In May, Ava was home for just a short break before heading off to basic training. While kayaking with friends on Grapevine Lake, Ava's life was taken in a senseless and preventable tragedy. Our entire office is heartbroken about her loss. I had the privilege of speaking with Ava's father, a man of great faith, kindness, and forgiveness. Even in the face of unimaginable loss, he told me that he was remaining hopeful and positive because, in his own words, that is how Ava would have wanted it. Our Nation is at a loss with Ava's passing. May we honor her by remembering the incredible woman that she was. May God bring peace to her family, knowing that her legacy and her example will last with all of us."
"Mr. Chair, I understood the member's question to be whether rural areas are served by this program. That is correct."
"good afternoon. My name is Jon Husted, and I have the distinct honor of serving the great State of Ohio as one of its U.S. Senators. Over the past 25 years, I have been blessed to serve the people of Ohio as a State representative, speaker of the house, secretary of state, and most recently as Lieutenant Governor. I am constantly reminded of the sacrifices generations of Americans and Ohioans have made in the hope that they will leave their country in a better place than they found it. And it is this pattern of sacrifice that I have also witnessed throughout my life growing up in the Midwest. So I would like to take a moment to reflect on the sacrifices others have made that have led to this moment in time and our responsibility as Americans to our children and to our country. So let me start at the beginning, at least for me. I was born in 1967, which was part of one of the most turbulent decades in American history. My start in life reflected those turbulent times. My birth mother lost her husband in the Vietnam war, and she found herself with multiple children to care for without anyone to share that responsibility. Then she learned that there was another baby on the way--and that baby was me. While I can never truly know how the circumstances affected her and why she made the choice that she did, I would like to believe that out of a loving heart and full of courage and selflessness that she gave me a chance to be adopted. My birth certificate reports that I was born in Michigan, but let me reassure you: I was made in Ohio. You see, during the fall of 1967, after 2 months in a foster home, I was blessed to become the first child of two humble, hard-working people from northwest Ohio Jim and Judy Husted. Even then, among the protests and the upheaval happening across the Nation, my parents were full of hope and optimism as they welcomed a new son into their home. They have always embodied the American tradition: that each generation works and sacrifices today so that the next generation can climb higher mountains tomorrow. That is the example my parents set as I grew up on County Road J near Montpelier, OH. Life was not easy for them. Like many families in the small towns in the industrial Midwest, we weathered factory closures. Several of my own family members lost their jobs when the machine tool factory they worked at shut down. But they faced hard times before, tough times make you tough and resilient, resilient enough to uproot your family, start over, and keep sacrificing for your family's well- being. And that is what they all did. My parents worked hard and never wasted a penny. They routinely made choices that made their lives harder so that they could make my life and my brother and sister's life a little easier. What I saw growing up in rural Ohio was simple but powerful, and it characterized communities across this country too. People worked long hours, forfeiting comfort and leisure so that their families, and especially their children, could enjoy more security and prosperity than they had. These diligent men and women may not have called their daily responsibilities on the factory floors or in the fields the American dream, but that is what it was. That is what they were striving to achieve. I believe this love for family and Nation, this aspirational hope that we have, has driven America's generations to risk their lives and livelihoods so that we could create the freest, most prosperous country in the world. The early settlers didn't sail across the Atlantic's high seas for fun and adventure; they came to build a legacy of opportunity and liberty that their homeland had denied them, but nothing guaranteed their future. They earned it through courage, toil, and sacrifice. I know this, the noise of the 24-hour news cycle makes it easy to lose perspective when you are here in Washington. I know it does. But if you step into the Capitol Rotunda and you look up at the storied paintings all around that dome, you will be reminded of an enduring pattern: Americans built this Nation through personal sacrifice, often at a steep human cost. In 1620, the settlers at Plymouth faced hunger, disease, and death as they launched into a new world where they hoped to establish religious freedom. In 1776, their descendants picked up that torch by risking everything to break free of the monarchy. When the Founders signed the Declaration of Independence, they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor--a wager not just for themselves, but on behalf of their children and future generations. At Valley Forge, liberty nearly froze to death, but those who endured did so ``to form a more perfect Union.'' They fought not just for freedom but for justice, peace, and the blessings of liberty, for their posterity--that is us. In 1861, Americans turned on one another so they could preserve the Nation and abolish slavery. They paid with blood. Then they returned to their fields and their towns and sought to rebuild a more cohesive nation, one capable of innovation, lasting growth, and a new hope. By the early 1900s, Americans led a second revolution--this, the industrial revolution. In a free nation and economy, workers and entrepreneurs built new industries, fought for fair working conditions, and laid the foundations for the prosperity we enjoy today. Immigrants came through Ellis and Angel Islands with hope in their hearts and the willingness to work hard, and America embraced them. In World War II, young men crossed oceans to fight tyranny, and women stepped onto factory floors to build the arsenal of victory. When it was all over, they followed their forefathers' faithfulness by coming home and building schools, churches, and businesses--in other words, a future. The ``greatest generation'' carried that burden for their children and for ours. The men and women who fought and endured daily hardships during the Second World War understood what I worry many Americans nearly have forgotten, which is that the heavier the load you choose to carry, the higher you can hold your head, and doing what is noble builds confidence. I believe that is true of people and of nations. For nearly two centuries, Americans weren't focused on indulgence but on inheritance. To be clear, I am not talking about the kind of inheritance measured in dollars but, instead, the kind measured in duty, making tomorrow better than today. Mr. President, you may be tempted to correct me here. Why would I only credit us with two centuries of discipline when, after all, we turn 250 years old next year? Let me take a moment to explain. This American ethos endured for most of our history, but I believe something shifted in our culture around thetime I was born. Our society began to leverage the security that earlier Americans won for tomorrow in order to avoid the challenges of the day. Courageous people don't do that. Even a few years before I was born, I believe President Kennedy had already begun to detect the shift. In his inaugural address, he implored Americans to do one thing:  Ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country.  A nation that once rallied around sacrifice--in war, in rebuilding, in laying foundations for the future--gave way to a new cultural mood. Over time, we stopped asking ``What can we build and leave for the ones we love?'' and we began to ask ``What can we claim for ourselves?'' We became obsessed with what we as individuals are entitled to, and we forgot how to plant the seeds and nurture them until the harvest. The sense of shared responsibility that had defined generations was eroded. Our growing reliance on promises we felt others owed to us meant that we earned less and expected more. We initially built a safety net to protect people in need and our most vulnerable citizens, which is a noble idea and one that I support, but, over time, that safety net stretched wider and wider until nearly everybody was lying in it. As the cost of our promises ballooned, we lacked the will to either pay for them or the courage to pare them back. So what did we do instead? We did what previous generations refused to do: We passed the buck by handing the bill off to our children. Instead of sacrificing for the next generation, we passed the burden on to them. It was a convenient deception. Congress created more programs that it wouldn't pay for. Public officials made promises they couldn't keep. They convinced their constituents that Americans who come of age after us would take care of tomorrow all by themselves. We also fought wars and engaged in foreign interventions without paying for them. It all adds up. All the while, our national debt kept rising. I am not just talking about dollars; America began experiencing a real character deficit. We weren't just spending money; we were squandering trust, legacy, and time at the expense of the boys and girls who were too young to even vote or recognize a better path than the one we had chosen for them. We soothed ourselves by claiming that we were being compassionate, but we passed on the consequences of our choices to those not yet born. This is not compassion; it is generational theft. In 1967, when I was born, the national debt stood at $330 billion. Today, it is $36 trillion--more than 100 times greater even after adjusting for inflation. In 2024 alone, we ran a $1.8 trillion deficit. A baby born in America today inherits $106,000 as their share of the national debt on day one. So what happened to American ingenuity, resolve, and discipline? What happened to it? How did a nation once defined by sacrifice for our kids--think about it--become one that was willing to pilfer their piggy banks? We have some urgent challenges. Twenty-first century Americans are not being asked to storm Normandy's beaches or endure winters at Valley Forge. The task upon us may seem less heroic, but it remains both daunting and deeply patriotic. What is that task? To simply stop spending more than we are willing to pay for today. The question isn't just ``How did America's financial and cultural debt get so deep?'' It is ``How can we claw our way out of this financial and cultural hole?'' The answer comes down to identifying what we value and what we believe is worth the sacrifice. For me, that is my family and my country. I love them both, and I know many of you share those same sentiments. I believe that we only sacrifice for the things we love. I will repeat that. I believe we only sacrifice for the things we love. That is why it is crucial and consequential that we remind ourselves and instruct our children to love this country, reminding ourselves that this pattern and promise of American liberty forged a noble, innovative nation that is worth loving and worth fighting for, because why would anyone sacrifice for a nation they don't love or for neighbors they don't feel a patriotic affection for?  America has been self-aware from the beginning. We never thought we were perfect. But every generation is supposed to put in the sweat and tears to form a more perfect Union. We were the first Nation rooted in the confidence that our rights come not from Kings or governments but from God, that we are endowed by our Creator with the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is a beautiful thought. That idea is exceptional. This country is exceptional. There are none like it in the world, and we must teach the next generation what our countrymen sacrificed to secure. And that is why this Nation is worth loving with an active and enduring patriotism. Loving America doesn't mean agreeing with every policy or politician. It is not required. But it does require being confident in the idea of America and being willing to sacrifice for the cause of this Nation-- not in the abstract but in real ways: by being good stewards of what was handed down to us and honoring those who came before us by adopting their discipline and by becoming the kind of neighbors who are willing to work a little harder, take a little less, and give a little more to preserve what has made this country great. I stand here today as the beneficiary of those who sacrificed for me and for all of us. I was blessed to be adopted into a loving home where they taught me that faith, family, freedom, and hard work are the most reliable anecdotes for poverty and despair the world has ever known. We are still a nation where a newborn can begin life in a foster home in Detroit, grow up in the rural Midwest, and have the honor of serving as a U.S. Senator. As Americans, no matter our background, whether we come from abundance or struggle, we have all inherited the gift of freedom, passed down from earlier Americans. We stand on their shoulders. Let's not force the next generation to remember us as the ones who broke the two-centuries-long chain of self-sacrifice but, rather, as the ones who reforged it. To my colleagues and constituents, count me in as one who is willing to do my part, to work hard, forgo convenience, and reinforce that chain that will sustain our Nation for future generations. I will listen to your ideas, and I hope you will listen to mine. I will operate from the principled belief that we must elevate liberty and personal responsibility above expediency and entitlement and that our children should not have to pay the price for our lack of discipline. The America I aspire to serve is defined by courage and a love that refuses to take more than it gives. As it has so many times in our history, may these convictions prevail in this Chamber and in the classrooms, boardrooms, break rooms, and living rooms of these United States. Consider this my prayer for our Nation, and may God work through us to make it so. I yield the floor."
"Not at the moment, but I will later. Healthcare professionals acting outside the law and abusive partners using violence or poisoning to end a pregnancy would still be criminalised, as they are now. There has been a cacophony of misinformation regarding new clause 1, so let us be clear: if it passes, it would still be illegal for medical professionals to provide abortions after 24 weeks, but women would no longer face prosecution. Nearly 99% of abortions happen prior to 20 weeks, and those needing later care often face extreme circumstances such as abuse, trafficking or serious foetal anomalies. The reality is that no woman wakes up 24 or more weeks pregnant and suddenly decides to end her own pregnancy outside a hospital or clinic, with no medical support, but some women in desperate circumstances make choices that many of us would struggle to understand. New clause 1 is about recognising that such women need care and support, not criminalisation. As Members will know, much of the work that I do is driven by the plight of highly vulnerable women and by sex-based rights, which is why I tabled new clause 1. I have profound concerns about new clause 106, tabled by the hon. Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Dr Johnson), which would remove the ability of women to have a consultation either on the phone or via electronic means, rowing back on the progress made in 2022 and again requiring women to attend a face-to-face appointment before accessing care. Introduced in 2020, telemedical abortion care represented a revolution for women and access to abortion care in this country. We led the world: evidence gathered in the UK helped women in some of the most restrictive jurisdictions, including the United States, to access abortion remotely. Here, the largest study on abortion care in the world found that telemedicine was safe and effective, and reduced waiting times. The fact is that half the women accessing abortion in England and Wales now use telemedical care. Given the increases in demand for care since the pandemic, there simply is not the capacity in the NHS or clinics to force these women to attend face-to-face consultations. New clause 106 would have a devastating effect on abortion access in this country, delaying or denying care for women with no clinical evidence to support it. What concerns me most about the new clause, however, is the claim that making abortion harder to access will help women in abusive relationships. Let me quote from a briefing provided by anti-violence against women and girls groups including End Violence Against Women, Rape Crisis, Women's Aid, Solace Women's Aid and Karma Nirvana, which contacted Members before the vote in 2022. They said: ""the argument that telemedicine facilitates reproductive coercion originates with anti-abortion groups, not anti-VAWG groups. The priority for such groups is restricting abortion access, not addressing coercion and abuse. Forcing women to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term does not solve domestic abuse."" I could not agree more. My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Ms Creasy), who tabled new clause 20, had a terrible experience today: she was unable to walk into Parliament because of the abuse that she was receiving outside and the pictures that were being shown. That was unforgivable, and I want to extend the hand of friendship to her and make it clear that we are not in this place to take such abuse. While my hon. Friend and I share an interest in removing women from the criminal law relating to abortion, new clause 20 is much broader in terms of the scope of its proposed change to the well-established legal framework that underpins the provision of abortion services. While I entirely agree with her that abortion law needs wider reform, the sector has emphasised its concern about new clause 20 and the ramifications that it poses for the ongoing provision of abortion services in England and Wales. The current settlement, while complex, ensures that abortion is accessible to the vast majority of women and girls, and I think that those in the sector should be listened to, as experts who function within it to provide more than 250,000 abortions every year. More comprehensive reform of abortion law is needed, but the right way to do that is through a future Bill, with considerable collaboration between providers, medical bodies and parliamentarians working together to secure the changes that are needed. That is what a change of this magnitude would require."
"I thank Representative Kiley for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 516 to condemn the violent riots in Los Angeles this month, and I thank our brave law enforcement officers for keeping us safe. I appreciate the heated debate and the conversation. I thank my colleague (Mr. Kiley) for leading on the groundwork and for explaining what led to the events that occurred last month in Los Angeles, which explains that Federal agents were conducting immigration enforcement, according to the law. Mr. Speaker, protecting public safety should not be controversial. This resolution is very simple. It recognizes a right to assemble and protest peacefully, and it condemns unequivocally the violence perpetrated against Federal, State, and local law enforcement. It calls on local and State-elected leadership to work with the Federal Government and restore peace. It also expresses gratitude to our local, State, and Federal law enforcement officers for bravely keeping our communities safe in the face of danger.  {time}  0930  That is what this is about. Do you stand with our law enforcement officers working to keep our communities safe and have the common sense to call out rioters who commit vandalism, violence, property damage, and other crimes in our streets? Mr. Speaker, like others in the Chamber and many across this country, I am an immigrant who came here legally in pursuit of the opportunities that this country provides. I am proud to be an American, and I am paying it forward to keep the American Dream alive for my children and grandchildren. Peaceful protests are a constitutional right we all cherish, and our communities should not be living in fear. But peaceful protests and freedom of assembly gave way to chaos in Los Angeles, as we witnessed a few weeks ago. We saw acts of arson, looting, property destruction, vandalism, blocking streets and highways, lighting cars on fire, shooting fireworks, throwing rocks at law enforcement vehicles, and even assaulting Federal and local police officers. As a result, we saw more than 500 rioters were arrested, and at least a dozen LAPD officers were injured. Local and State leadership clearly could not contain the chaos. The riots have cost at least $30 million to pay overtime and repair property damages to city buildings. This doesn't include the small businesses and other private entities whose businesses fell victim to the destruction. We also know that the riots were enabled by California's soft-on- crime policies that have allowed for lawlessness and endangered public safety. Again, this resolution recognizes the right to assemble and protest peacefully, condemns the violence against law enforcement, and calls on local and State officials to work with the Federal Government to restore peace. We thank our law enforcement. This is not controversial."
The hon. member.
"Mr. Speaker, TD Bank says the Prime Minister 's housing policy promises are not enough for the federal government to reach its goal of 500,000 new units annually over the next decade. In fact, housing starts are expected to decline next year. The Prime Minister's proposed new bureaucracy will not build any homes. There is too much red tape. Canadians deserve better. When will the government table a budget so that Canadians will learn whether the government has any plan to put a roof over their head?"
"Mr. Chair, it is none. Does the U.S. have a federal industrial carbon tax?"
"Mr. Speaker, I wonder if my friend could tell me what he thinks would be better: Would it be better for Ottawa to provide a bulk grant to provinces for fire suppression, allowing the provinces to lead in terms of fighting the fires, or would it be better for Ottawa to buy the water bombers outright? What does he believe? Does he have more confidence in the provinces that have that equipment and allowing them that sort of discretion, or should Ottawa purchase the water bombers outright?"
"We all remember the glorious summer of 2012 when the world's greatest athletes came to London to compete in the Olympics and the Paralympics. It showcased Britain at its best, not just in track and field, but as a country that can host major cultural and sporting events. My right hon. and learned Friend has been written to by over 200 of our top athletes--some of them are members of Cambridge Harriers, who meet in my constituency--and they are calling for the Government to support the bid for the 2029 world athletics championships to take place in London. If successful, it will lift the whole nation--[Interruption.] If successful, it will lift the whole nation, inspire a generation of new athletes, showcase Britain on the world stage and put PS400 million into our economy. What's not to like?"
"May I take the Foreign Secretary back and ask that he clarifies the nature of the Israeli military personnel training on British soil and whether those involved are participating in operations in Gaza? If so, how does that align with the UK's international legal obligations given that Israel faces proceedings standing accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, given that its leadership has arrest warrants issued against it at the International Criminal Court, and given that this Government have also moved to sanction senior Israeli officials?"
"I welcome my hon. Friend's point. As he will know, many local authorities across the country have worked to ensure that they raise standards and checks in their licensing arrangements, particularly those in areas where there have been serious problems and criminal cases. However, those checks and safeguards can end up being undermined by the licensing of taxis in other areas that do not have such checks, so we are looking to take forward reforms to the law. The Transport Secretary is looking at exactly this issue to make sure that we find a way to close the loophole."
"Mr. Speaker, what really matters is that we will always be there to defend Canadian industry and Canadian workers. Not only will we look at what our American colleagues may put on the table, but Canada is always going to be there to support our industry and support our workers. This is sometimes the best—"
"I thank my hon. Friend for her question and for rightly recognising the importance to our country of its capital city, which has been at the centre of our engine of growth for many years. She also alludes to the fact that we have a brilliant Labour Mayor of London in Sadiq Khan, who strongly makes the case for investment in the capital. We will make further announcements next week that will bolster and strengthen London, and Sadiq's leadership in London, to deliver for the whole country."
"Mr. Speaker, the current Prime Minister 's focus is on ensuring that we have more accountability and transparency, and he has taken actions to be able to demonstrate that in terms of procurement. One of the things I would emphasize is that over the coming years, we are going to see a lot more money spent on procurements because of the commitment to build a stronger, healthier Canadian forces. We have made the commitment to 2%. The Prime Minister is very keen on moving forward, and we have confidence in the civil service to ensure that justice is done in regard to GC Strategies."
"Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is a broken record of broken promises. He said that we should judge him by the price at the grocery store and that he is the man with a plan. He is failing. Since the start of this year, beef is up 34%, oranges are up 26%, apples are up 18% and baby formula is up 9%. This is making it harder for families trying to put nutritious food on the table. Will the Prime Minister do the right thing and table a budget that actually cuts taxes and reverses his inflationary policies?"
The hon. member for Calgary Crowfoot.
"Mr. Speaker, I want to mention that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Guelph . It is an honour to rise in the House today to speak to Bill C-5 to create one Canadian economy. As this is the first time I have had the opportunity to rise in the House to deliver a speech since the election, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the great people of West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country for putting their trust in me to be their representative. Whether someone voted for me or not, I take it to heart each and every day that I am here to represent them, to be their voice in Ottawa and to ensure that the diverse needs of our region are met and are reflected by our government. I would not be here without the work of an incredible campaign team led by Morgan, Leo, Tess, Norman, Chloe, Lilah, Lea, Natasha, Maira, Kiran, Fei and so many more, including hundreds of volunteers from all regions in my riding. I thank them for their long hours, their dedication, their hard work, and their belief in me and the work that we are doing. This victory is as much theirs as it is mine. I thank my parents and my sister for their support and want to give a special shout-out to my nephews Haiden, Beckham and Sawyer for bringing so much joy to the campaign. More than anything, I want to thank my wonderful partner, Anastasia, for being there with me and for me every step of the way. I know this is a hard job that requires a lot of sacrifice for me to be away from her and from our home, and it is much appreciated. This year, our country has been faced with an unprecedented challenge in this lifetime with the election of U.S. President Donald Trump and the unjustified and illegal tariffs he has wrought on our country. It has been with a great sense of pride that our country has come together in defiance of this threat. As a country, we realized that we needed to diversify our trade around the world, as well as build up our internal markets by tearing down interprovincial trade barriers. One of our government’s first orders of business since this election was to table the one Canadian economy act. Canada's strength has always come from its people, but too often, our economy has not reflected that same unity. Outdated trade barriers, and fragmented and balkanized regulatory systems have made it harder for Canadians to build, innovate and thrive. We have been working with 13 provincial and territorial economies instead of one Canadian economy, and that has come at cost. Whether it is a trucker trying to move goods across the provincial border, a nurse seeking work in another jurisdiction, or a business in B.C. trying to sell into the market here in Ontario, the message that we heard has been the same: It should not be this hard to do business in Canada. The two parts of the one Canadian economy act would change that. First, the free trade and labour mobility in Canada act would remove federal barriers to internal trade and labour mobility so that Canadians and businesses could move, work and grow across the country with fewer obstacles. Right now, Canada is losing billions of dollars a year in productivity and economic output because of fragmented internal markets. A recent estimate from the Macdonald-Laurier Institute pegged the cost of internal trade barriers at up to $200 billion in lost GDP. That is not a rounding error. That is a missed opportunity the size of an entire provincial economy. Further, studies have shown that removing these trade barriers could lower the prices that people pay for goods by up to 15%. Needless to say, it is imperative and a no-brainer to move ahead with these changes. That is just the macroeconomic picture. On the ground, it is even more frustrating. Small businesses looking to grow and access new markets across provincial lines face hurdles that feel arbitrary. Workers trained to national standards find themselves unable to cross provincial borders without getting recertified. Consumers are facing fewer choices and higher prices. The core idea of Bill C-5 is this: If a good, service or professional qualification meets the regulatory standards of a province or territory and those standards are comparable to federal ones, then it should be recognized federally for the purposes of internal trade and labour mobility. Canadians increasingly want to buy local, and not just from their province. They want to buy Canadian. By supporting efforts to harmonize standards and expand inter-provincial sales, we are giving consumers more choice and local producers more reach. Another area where we can expect gains is in the direct-to-consumer alcohol market. This would be a game-changer to ensure that we have the amazing wines and microbrews from B.C. available here in Ontario. I want to acknowledge the work of our provincial and territorial partners. This is not a federal-only story, even if this legislation is only with respect to federal jurisdiction. From coast to coast to coast, provinces are taking initiative. They are reviewing outdated exceptions, simplifying regulatory frameworks and demonstrating a growing willingness to work together. Nova Scotia's free trade and mobility within Canada act, Ontario's memoranda of understanding with six other provinces to harmonize standards and reduce red tape, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador signing bilateral agreements to improve co-operation, and B.C.'s economic stabilization act are concrete, collaborative steps that Bill C-5 complements perfectly. Second, as the Prime Minister mentioned during the campaign, Canada needs to do things that have not been imagined or were not thought possible at a speed we have not seen before. We need to seize the incredible opportunities at our disposal and build nation-building projects, such as interprovincial electrical grid interties, to better trade within Canada, and invest in ports to diversify our trade away from the United States. The proposed mechanism to do that is the building Canada act. This new act would allow a single minister, after consulting with the provinces and indigenous peoples, to declare projects in the national interest and pre-approve them subject to conditions geared to protecting the environment. The Prime Minister further declared that projects would not be declared in the national interest and imposed upon provinces that are not willing. Make no mistake. Bill C-5 proposes extraordinary powers that are only justified in an extraordinary time. Many would agree we are in that situation today. However, I would like to point out a few aspects of the bill that should be studied at committee if it passes second reading. First, while it is hard to think it was not that long ago, the first ministers' meeting from just a week and a half ago produced a rigorous list of criteria that would inform whether a project can be declared in the national interest. However, the way the legislation is written would allow for unnamed factors to also drive decision-making. This should be carefully scrutinized at committee. Second, the legislation would give a minister the ability to exempt any national interest project from an existing law or regulation based on the advice of a minister. If this type of power is to be in the hands of a minister, it is important that there be disclosure and transparency in how that power is going to be used. Third, the powers this legislation proposes are due to be valid for five full years. We are currently living in a crisis, an extraordinary circumstance brought on by the illegal and unjustified tariffs from President Trump. I absolutely believe that if we talk to steel and aluminum workers or workers in the automotive sector, they will confirm just that. However, this legislation is due to be in effect beyond that, beyond what will be at least one more federal election, and we need to consider how this legislation could be used in bad faith by a future government. Where there are issues with existing environmental laws causing undue and unacceptable delays in permitting projects in our country, I believe they can be fully reviewed and amended, hopefully obviating the need for these measures in the future. When a small business in Squamish wants to ship products across the country, it should be able to do that without running into arbitrary provincial rules, likewise if a health care worker wants to practise in Sechelt. I can see my time is running out. I thank all members for their consideration. I look forward to questions."
What recent discussions she has had with Cabinet colleagues on support for clean energy projects in Wales
"I do not think any decisions are being made for political reasons--our medical and health staff are very much focused on doing the right thing from a clinical point of view. The hon. Lady raises an important point about continuity of care, with people constantly having to be re-referred into the system. Part of the reason for that is the utter incompetence with which the previous Government managed our primary care system, which has resulted in people being passed from pillar to post, the additional roles reimbursement scheme not actually being about having GPs on the frontline, but about having other staff, which creates more friction in the system, and poorer continuity of care. This Government are going to bring back the family doctor--that is the way to get our general practice back on its feet."
"Mr. Speaker, first, let me acknowledge and thank my hon. colleague for his years of service to promote public safety in this country. We are working alongside police forces and federations representing frontline members to understand the needs of frontline officers to ensure they have the resources to help keep communities safe. In addition, we are moving forward with a series of reforms that are going to strengthen sentencing regimes for violent repeat offenders, as well as addressing the needs of the bail system, particularly targeting home invasions, human trafficking, auto theft and other offences related to organized crime. I am happy to work with the hon. member and benefit from his experience as we advance these important reforms."
"Diolch yn fawr iawn, Dirprwy Lefarydd. The announcement of just PS44.5 million a year for the next 10 years for Welsh rail is Labour's flimsy fig leaf of an excuse for the multibillion and multi-decade scandal that is HS2. The money announced today is only significant if it matches what Wales will continue to lose from all England-only rail projects, up to now and in the future. Can the Chancellor guarantee that from now on, Wales will receive the full PS4 billion HS2 consequential funding, or will she admit that her announcement on Welsh rail funding is nothing but smoke and mirrors?"
I set up the Corby and east Northants SEND roundtable to help seek solutions to fix the broken system. One of the outcomes of the discussions was the need to improve SEND provision in our mainstream schools. What is the Minister doing to engage with teachers to make schools more inclusive and maximise the potential of every child?
"The House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). (The House adjourned at 11:02 p.m.)"
"We will make sure that they engage. In a strange way, I think that the campaign that has been led by the hon. Lady and others, in the House of Lords and elsewhere, will help to make people engage in what will not necessarily be an easy process, but one that I think could deliver a win-win for us in the UK and could potentially enable us to lead for other countries in the world. Every indication that we have had thus far suggests that everyone wants to sit in the room together, and, of course, we will have to provide significant leadership in those meetings to be able to drive them forward. As I said on the last occasion when I was talking about these matters at the Dispatch Box, I should like to be able to get on with that as soon as possible, but we have a duty to get the Bill out of the way first. Let me now say a few words about ping-pong. As Members will know, this is in large measure the same Bill that was presented, twice, by the previous Government. The second Bill fell at the general election, but both major parties committed themselves to reintroducing it, in a broadly similar form, in the new Parliament. None of the parties intended to introduce any matters relating to copyright into the Bill when they discussed it in the run-up to, and during, the general election. I warmly commend those who are fighting the corner of the creative industries--of course I do; I am the creative industries Minister--but there comes a point at which the Lords is barring the Commons from fulfilling a pledge made by both major parties. We shall now be entering the fourth round of ping-pong. Few Bills in our history have gone this many rounds. In the cases of the Prevention of Terrorism Bill of 2004-05 and the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill 2006-07, at issue was what the Government had put in rather than what it had not included. Neither of those Bills had been openly advocated by both main parties at a general election. By tradition, the House of Lords does not interfere with Bills to which Governments have committed themselves at the time of a general election. Everyone agrees that this Bill is a valuable piece of legislation, and for that reason I urge their lordships to let it pass into law."
"We talk regularly with our colleagues in Northern Ireland, and I am always happy to do so. As the hon. Lady knows, this matter is devolved, so it is a matter for Northern Ireland, and we respect the devolution settlement. Our elective reform plan, published in January 2025, builds on the investments already made with an ambitious vision for the future of diagnostic testing. This will include more straight-to-test pathways, increasing and expanding community diagnostic centres, and better use of technology. With nearly 170 community diagnostic centres up and running, they can take on more of the growing diagnostic demand in elective and cancer care. We will also deliver additional capacity in 2025-26 by expanding some existing centres and building up to five new ones. We will address the challenges in diagnostic waiting times, providing the CT, MRI and other tests that are needed to reduce the elective and cancer waits. Members know that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence--we have heard a little about it this evening--is an independent body responsible for assessing whether new licensed medicines can be recommended for routine use in England, based on a thorough assessment of their clinical and cost effectiveness. The NHS is legally required to fund NICE recommended medicines, ensuring consistency of access for NHS patients wherever they live in England. NICE is able to recommend promising new cancer medicines for use through the cancer drugs funds, which supports patient access while real-world evidence is generated to address clinical uncertainties. Through the cancer drugs fund, NHS patients also benefit from access to cancer medicines from the point of positive draft NICE guidance, accelerating access to clinically and cost effective medicines by up to five months. Through this process, many thousands of patients, including patients with prostate cancer, have been able to benefit from effective new treatments at prices that represent value to the NHS. The drug that is the subject of this debate, abiraterone, is licensed, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing Central and Acton said. It is recommended by NICE for use in the treatment of certain types of metastatic prostate cancer, and it is now routinely available to NHS patients in England in line with the NICE recommendation. NHS England has recently put in place an interim commissioning policy that makes abiraterone available for men with high-risk, hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer, pending the outcome of NICE's update of its negative guidance. I am pleased that this approach was agreed between NICE and NHS England late last year to ensure uninterrupted access to abiraterone for men leaving the STAMPEDE trial. My hon. Friend raised particular concerns about access to this drug for men with non-metastatic prostate cancer. First, it is important to note that abiraterone is not licensed by the MHRA for use in this indication, and it is therefore off-label. NICE does not evaluate the off-label uses of medicines, and the drug is also now off-patent and available generically, which means there is no single manufacturer that could sponsor an MHRA licence application or NICE evaluation. It is therefore for NHS organisations to take decisions on funding based on the available evidence. NHS England considered abiraterone for the treatment of non-metastatic prostate cancer through its clinical prioritisation process last year. Through this process, NHS England concluded that evidence supported the routine commissioning of the drug in this indication. Approximately 7,000 men per year could be eligible for this drug, and it is estimated that it would cost an additional PS20 million per year to fund that. While, as my hon. Friend said, there may be some cost savings in the pathway from preventing the disease's progression, these are unlikely to materialise for about   five years and would not impact the up-front costs of the PS20 million per year for the additional out-patient monitoring and drug cost. I had not heard the figures she outlined, but I will get back to her on some of the questions she asked, and it would be helpful to know where those figures are from. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to identify the necessary current funding to support the commissioning of abiraterone for this purpose or any other treatments in this prioritisation round. I know that is disappointing for those affected, and I want to acknowledge that this is a really difficult and unusual situation. However, I want to assure my hon. Friend and other hon. Members that the funding position for this treatment does not mean that there are no treatment options. The NICE guideline on prostate cancer recommends the treatment of non-metastatic prostate cancer with surgery and radiotherapy. I want to assure hon. Members that NHS England is keeping this position under review, and would reconsider funding for abiraterone for non-metastatic prostate cancer if the funding position changes. Earlier this month, NHS England met Prostate Cancer UK, which shared its financial model of the expected cost impacts. NHS England is reviewing this in more detail, and I encourage it to continue those discussions. In closing, I recognise how hard it is when patients want access to effective treatments. I also recognise the distress and worry it causes not only for patients, but for their families and friends. The Government are committed to ensuring that we provide access to the most innovative and effective medicines, but it has to be in a way that is sustainable and affordable for the NHS. It is right that NHS England continues to engage with Prostate Cancer UK, and I know that my hon. Friend and other Members will keep an eye on this and similar issues with drugs coming forward. The national cancer plan will seek to improve every aspect of cancer care, to better the experience and outcomes of people with cancer. Our goal is to reduce the number of lives lost to cancer over the next 10 years. I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the debate this evening. Question put and agreed to. House adjourned."
"We are certainly moving as fast as we can. I will explain where the process has got to, and I hope that Members will be reassured. The transfer of PS1.5 billion from the mineworkers' pension boosted pensions by 32%, which was an average increase of PS29 a week for each member. The hon. Member for Ashfield made the point that this is about putting money not just into people's pockets but into local communities, and that is incredibly important. I also understand that in the context of the BCSSS in exactly the same way. My officials are working closely with the trustees of the mineworkers' pension on the review of the future surplus sharing arrangements, and we hope to come forward with proposals and reach an agreement on that soon. Having worked closely with the coalfield communities on the delivery of the mineworkers' pension, I completely recognise the strength of feeling on the BCSSS."
"On that point, there are many brave men and women in my constituency who are serving or who have served. I am proud of them and their families, and I thank them for their contribution this Armed Forces Week. My hon. Friend mentioned the Royal British Legion, and I wish to give particular thanks to Tilehurst Royal British Legion in my constituency. It does a fantastic job to support our veterans, particularly Christine Lewendon, the president of the Tilehurst branch. Will my hon. Friend join me in thanking them for all that they do?"
"Again, Mr. Chair, I am speaking as transport minister in a new government. This is an issue I am aware of. I am aware of the concerns of passenger rights groups and the concerns of passengers. I take those concerns very seriously—"

"Mr. Chair, we have a levels plan that has been tabled in this House. We have targeted numbers. Those numbers are very much in the public eye. Everybody can look at them. We are meeting those numbers."
"Madam Speaker, we all follow the various rules of Parliament, one being with respect to attire in the House that is suitable. Last night during the vote, a Conservative member's vote was not counted because the government made a point of raising an issue with respect to his attire. I ask you for clarification on the outfit this member is wearing. As we all know, men must wear a suit jacket and tie in order to speak. I see now that he has actually put a suit coat on. I ask for clarification."
"The Government continue to claim that they wish to expand community diagnostic centres to speed up scanning and treatment of patients and therefore reduce demand on the likes of A&E. If that is the case, why are they cutting the revenue tariffs that were available to the community diagnostic centres under the previous Conservative Government, which has already impacted the financial viability of the CDCs and access for patients?"
"The decision to restore the winter fuel payment to those earning under PS35,000 a year is the right decision. I thank the Minister and his predecessor for their constructive engagement with representations from my constituents in Stockton, Billingham and Norton on the threshold issue, but does he agree with my constituent who wrote to me to say that, although welcome, the winter fuel payment is not a silver bullet, and this Government's commitment to the triple lock stands in stark contrast to the previous Conservative Government's breaking of that triple lock in 2022, which is still costing my constituents hundreds of pounds a year?"
"Madam Speaker, my colleague gave a very good speech with a smile on his face. I have to say that throughout his speech, I kept thinking about how his first and last names, which I cannot say here, are so similar to Miles Davis, one of my favourite musicians. This brought the following question to mind. Does my colleague not think that, given the crisis we are experiencing with the United States, calling an election and coming back with just a throne speech and not presenting a budget, despite the economic emergency, feels a bit like improvisation?"
"Mr. Chair, do the government's regulations prohibit the sale of new, fully gas-powered cars in Canada after 2035, yes or no?"
"Mr. Speaker, I really enjoyed the member's speech. In particular, at the start of it, he was talking about the issue of Canadians of convenience. When I meet with people back home, especially people who have immigrated to Canada, they had to work hard. They had to prove they were solvent and had the means to be able to be a contributing member of society. When we look at the bill, we see what the Liberals are doing with what it means to become a Canadian citizen. They have really cheapened what it takes to become a Canadian citizen. I am just wondering if my colleague has any thoughts on what the Liberals are doing with the bill in really cheapening what it takes and what it means to become Canadian."
"Mr. Speaker, it is more broken promises with the Prime Minister , broken promises on spending, on tax cuts, on defence, on elbows up with the U.S., and now on consultants. While offering Canadians a meagre $90 tax cut this year, he is not getting the money back from GC Strategies and is paying yet another consultant to update websites for an undisclosed fee. It is billions for consultants and peanuts for Canadians. Why is the Prime Minister giving consultants so much and Canadians so little?"
"Madam Chair, can the minister confirm today that when the budget comes out this fall, it will not be a dollar over that?"
I call the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee.
"I appreciate my friend from Texas, and I wish him safe travels back home to our great State."
"Mr. Chair, again, this particular case is under investigation, and it would not be appropriate for me—"
"In Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, up to 1,400 people died because of covid, and many in my constituency are living with grief, trauma and long covid. When I speak to GPs, they are rightly pleased with and proud of their role in vaccinating our town and country, but they feel that this role has been forgotten. Does my hon. Friend agree that we must remember the contribution of our GPs as vaccinators, and send the signal that this House thanks them?"
"Mr. Chair, is the minister aware of the internationally governed and internationally funded International Joint Commission?"
"Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for bringing to the House's attention the issue around merely transferring the ministry under which the Coast Guard operates from one department to defence without actually increasing or enhancing the defence capabilities of Canada. Taking a civilian force that undertakes civilian activity and bringing it under the authority of the Minister of National Defence does not make it a defence organization. We know the vital importance of the Coast Guard, but in order to make it a military force that increases Canada's defence capability, it needs to change. I would like the member to comment further on that."
"Mr. Speaker, I definitely heard those across the aisle blaming global inflation, which is a tired deflection. Canadians do not care where it all started. They care that it is worse here and that they are paying for it. The government's refusal to control its spending and the industrial carbon tax directly drives up costs across the supply chain, from farms to trucks to store shelves. It is not a global issue; it is Liberal policy."
"as Representative of the Ohio region that produces the most eggs in our Nation, I rise to say happy National Egg Day: Easter eggs, chocolate eggs, egg yolks, egg whites, egg souffle, meringue pie, egg salad, and so much more. Egg prices still cost 25 percent more at the grocery store. The answer is: Don't ignore the devastating impact of bird flu decimating flocks across our district and Nation. Meanwhile, the big egg conglomerates like Cal-Maine are posting record profits, tripling them, while millions of Americans struggle to afford basic staples. Can't they pack six eggs per pack to help buyers afford some eggs rather than no eggs at all? Our district is home to millions of egg-laying hens and countless family-run poultry operations. Ohio families and farmers deserve better than price gouging and political spin. If we want to protect our food supply and keep our family farms alive, we must accelerate development of a safe and effective vaccine and flu remedy as well as coop control and sanitary protocols. Farmers can't afford to have their flocks wiped out time and again.  On this National Egg Day, I stand with the people who make our breakfast, not the ones making excuses and delaying scientific progress."
"I agree with the hon. Gentleman. Again, people who pay attention to the detail will know that there are already mutual aid agreements in place between prisons and local police forces to ensure that if an armed response is required, it is available."
I thank the hon. member for Lakeland for her intervention. The Chair will take it under deliberation.
"I enjoy working with my colleague from Louisiana, and he has made several points worth noting. He has noted that this strategy of enabling people to pay back their loan according to their income doesn't solve the large issue of why our colleges cost so much, and he has noted that it doesn't do anything about predatory college programs that charge a lot and deliver little. Now, I was here when Tom Harkin led the effort to shut down the for- profit programs that often weren't even accredited but were signing up veterans like crazy and ripping them off, leaving them with massive debt. And we couldn't get any help from across the aisle to take that on. So he is right; it won't solve everything. But the idea is that you pay according to your income, and as your income goes up, you pay back more. And the default rate is cut in half. So the Federal Government actually takes in more money than it would otherwise, and students believe that they do have an opportunity, despite the high cost of college--because that is just not going to be fixed overnight. You know, in Germany, tuition is zero. Germany has said every child should have the opportunity to thrive. But here in America, we make it so the rich have that opportunity, and ordinary families in my blue- collar community are going: We don't think our children can afford to go to college. That hurts all of us. It hurts every child whose dreams are crushed because of these high costs of college. I am happy to work with my colleague from Louisiana on ideas on how we lower the cost of college. But we have got a lot of folks going to college right now. Let's help these students know that they can go through those doors as a freshman and, if they thrive, they are going to pay back their loans fast and, if they don't thrive so much in a higher income job or it is a public service job, they will pay it back more slowly. But they will never have to default. I think it is a vision worth continuing to work on because our higher education system is not working as well as the systems in many other countries that are saying every child will have an opportunity. I believe--like my father did, like my mother did--in America as a land of opportunity for every child, not just the children of the rich."
"the hour is late. I want to thank the Presiding Officer for being here. I am glad to be here with my colleague from New Hampshire and my neighbor from New Mexico. I want to thank the floor staff that is here tonight. And I would like to suggest--but it is not the purpose of my speech--that the next time Senatorsmake the suggestion that the floor staff should spend the entire night reading a bill here, that the Senators actually read that bill instead of imposing that on the staff that is here. I think that would be a just thing for us to do and the appropriate and proper thing for us to do. Madam President, the last time that we were headed down this road, which was when Republicans were passing President Trump's 2017 deficit- exploding tax cut, it didn't take a mathematical genius to figure out what was about to happen. I told the Senate at that time that, as our debt grows, we will spend billions more not on schools, roads, and innovation but on interest costs. Worse, we were about to blow another hole in the debt without really helping the middle class, and 8 years ago, I said: On top of that, we know that, when deficits swell, as they surely will, cuts to Medicaid and Medicare will be sure to follow, further burdening working families struggling to make ends meet. Well, here we are. That is exactly the story of this bill. Utterly predictable is this bill which massively increases our deficit when our children can least afford it. The Republican Senators who will be passing this bill tonight or tomorrow morning, if they do, know they are doing it when we have already hit a new milestone for the first time in American history. Our interest payments exceed the amount that we spend on our national defense. For the first time, the American people, because of the irresponsibility of those in this Chamber, are going to pay $1 trillion in interest. That is a massive number. That is essentially the same as what we spend on Medicare; as what we spend on children and higher education together; as what we spend on housing, bridges, broadband, ports, and highways combined. I want to be very clear tonight that over the years, Democrats and Republicans have pursued policies that have led to that $1 trillion in interest payments--there is no doubt about it--and it is worth thinking about what we could do if we hadn't made such fiscally irresponsible choices: expand the child tax credit, as my colleague from Georgia said; cut childhood poverty in half and hunger by a quarter; build a modern energy group to meet our expanding energy demands so Americans in cities and rural communities can enjoy affordable, reliable energy at home; establish a healthcare system that the American people deserve--a modern system that people in other rich, industrialized countries take for granted, a system that does not cost twice as much with worse outcomes like in the United States of America, the richest country in the world, that forces parents to choose between their children's prescriptions and school supplies and that exhausts the American people who, day after day after day, have to fight endless negotiations with their insurance companies just to keep their children covered; that constantly threatens rural hospitals and clinics with closures in this country. No other rich country in the world puts up with that craziness. And we are spending twice as much as any other country in the world to get worse healthcare, worse outcomes, and more scarcity.  Every Senator on this floor might make a different choice about the policies that they would enact, their preferred policies, but I doubt that there is anybody here who is willing to go home and defend the virtues of wasting $1 trillion of the American people's money on interest payments. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and outside groups like the Penn Wharton Budget Lab tell us that by the end of the next 10 years, we will have the highest debt ratio ever, eclipsing the debt our Nation had in the 1940s. What was happening in the 1940s? That is when the ``greatest generation'' had borrowed money to defeat economic misery at home through the New Deal and European fascism by becoming the arsenal of democracy. Those were their receipts. Those were the receipts of a generation that understood its commitment to the next generation--to us. When we contemplate from this broken Senate the patriotic accomplishments of the ``greatest generation,'' what has always seemed particularly egregious to me has been the tax policy Republicans have passed four times since Ronald Reagan passed it in 1981. Every single time, they made the same promises--every time. Look it up. They made the same promises that their trickle-down tax policy would drive economic growth, cut our deficit, pay for itself. Every time, including the recent Trump tax cut in 2017, these promises have been false. They have been false. That was 8 years ago. That wasn't a century ago. We know what the math is. Everybody in this room knows the deficit is far worse today than it was when Donald Trump passed those tax cuts. President Trump has had a very rare thing happen, which is he got to take 4 years off and come back and be President. The effect of the tax cuts he passed the last time that he said were going to pay for themselves clearly have not. There is nobody in this Chamber who can deny that. I always find it amazing, when I hear these promises, why people make them if they know they are so false--over and over and over again. I think the reason is that it is a way that politicians in Washington can avoid the objections that you could never get away with at home. Imagine for a minute if there were a mayor in America, any mayor in any town--in Santa Fe, NM; or in Limon, CO; or in Los Angeles, CA--it doesn't matter--a Republican town or a Democratic town. Imagine if a mayor came to join you and said: This town is going to borrow more money than we have ever borrowed before. That would worry you. That would worry me. I think our first question to that mayor would be: OK. That worries me. What are you going to spend the money on that you are going to borrow? Are you going to spend it on schools? No. Are you going to spend it on parks? No. Are you going to spend it on the water infrastructure that so many communities in New Mexico require? Are you going to spend it on the mental health crisis that our teenagers are facing because of our failure to address it? Are you going to spend it on infrastructure? The answer to all those questions would be no. What are you going to spend the money on, Mr. Mayor? Well, the answer is, I am going to give tax cuts to the two richest neighborhoods in town and hope that those trickle down to everybody else. That is the Republican tax policy. There is a reason why no mayor in America has ever done that. There is no mayor in America who has ever pursued trickle-down economics because you would get run out on a rail. You would get run out on a rail if you went and said: We are going to borrow the most money that has ever been borrowed from our children to finance tax cuts for the richest neighborhoods in town. It makes no sense. It is preposterous. Yet that has been the argument since Ronald Reagan first said that these tax cuts will be paid for, that the economy will grow, that there won't be a deficit. There is a reason we are paying more than $1 trillion in interest today, and that is because our deficits are enormous. Fortunately--and this is really important for the American people to understand--we still live in the strongest country in the world. We are in the world's richest economy. We have the most lethal military. Apart from our President, we have a national commitment to an independent judiciary, the rule of law, and low levels of corruption in our economy and in our society. We have unparalleled capital markets, cutting-edge innovation, and world-leading universities. We have all those things going for us partly because the folks who came before us invested in those things and built those things and tended those things. But what we struggle with in our time is a sense amongst most Americans that they can't get ahead, that the American dream is further and further out of reach for themselves and for their families. In my view, that is the biggest challenge our country faces and in the face of this bill's ill-considered tax cuts and cuts to our healthcare system, which is going to throw millions of people off of their healthcare and make healthcare more expensive for everybody else.  By the way, what is the logic of that? The logic of that is that when you throw people off their healthcare, they end up going to the emergency room to take care of themselves and take care of their families, just as anybody would. That is the most expensive care that anybody could have. That expense is then put in our insurance policies, and all of us are going to pay more. You can't wish away people just because you throw them off health insurance. When other countries in the world--other wealthy, rich countries in the world--have a system of insurance that basically guarantees healthcare and mental health care to their citizens, it is worth asking why we would throw our people off the not-so-great health insurance that they have. That is a good question. But it is particularly crazy when it just drives up the cost for everybody else.  We need to deeply think about the challenges that our country is facing today. It is more unequal. The top 1 percent own 30 percent of our Nation's wealth, and the bottom 50 percent own 2\1/2\ percent. The top 1 percent of Americans own 50 percent of the value of the stock market. The top 1 percent of Americans own 50 percent of the value of the stock market while the bottom 50 percent own just 1 percent of its value. Something that is really affecting my State is that the Nation's median home price is now five times higher than the median family income. As a result, the average first-time home buyer is now 38 years old--38 years old--versus 29 just a generation ago. Reading scores in our Nation have hit a 20-year low. And perhaps most damning and perhaps most upsetting is that our lifespan has declined since the 1980s. We are now, on average, likely to die 6 years sooner than other people who live in wealthy countries around the world. If you are African American, your chance of dying is, on average, 12 years--12 years-- sooner than people living in the industrialized world. If we don't shift course soon, we will be the first generation of Americans whose kids and grandkids will be worse off than we are. That has never happened before. We are on track for that to happen to our children. Many young people today can't afford to live on their own, and they may never be able to afford a house. They can't afford healthcare or childcare. They can't count on a quality education for their children in too many parts of America. Some are really worried about whether they are going to be able to afford a child at all. If you haven't heard a family say that to you in your townhalls or in your meetings, you haven't been paying attention. But instead of addressing any of these challenges, we are debating a bill tonight that will make the wealthiest Americans even wealthier and the poorest Americans even poorer--half a million of whom live in Colorado--while adding millions more to the debt, which working Americans are going to have to pay back. That is what this Republican trickle-down economics comes down to. No matter how you dress it up, that is what it comes down to. Our generation has made some very bad choices when it comes to our children's future. This bill only makes matters worse for them. And all this debt will constrain the choices they are going to be able to make for themselves. That is a shame because, unlike us, perhaps they will aspire to follow in the footsteps of the ``greatest generation'' and build a country where lifespans are growing, not falling; where economic mobility is rising; where poverty and economic anxiety are falling; where energy exports are increasing and emissions are decreasing; where quality healthcare and childcare and education and affordable housing are abundant, not scarce. It seems obvious to me that our child's ambitions should be ours as well. Unfortunately, tomorrow, the Republican majority may pass a bill that takes us further in the wrong direction. In its wake and in its wreckage, Americans who do feel an obligation to the next generation are going to have to fight even harder to fulfill our duty. I yield the floor."
"I agree with the hon. Gentleman--they are not alone. In relation to any questions about the experience of our consular support, I invite right hon. and hon. Members to ensure that I am aware, both in relation to the tragic incident in India, but also in Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Iran. As the Minister for consular affairs, let me say that it is important that we understand what the experience is like for people on ground. In relation to this incident, as I told the shadow Foreign Secretary, I spoke with teams this afternoon to ensure that UK support is as clearly signposted as possible on the ground."
"Mr. Speaker, our new government recently introduced the one Canadian economy act, which is intended to tear down internal barriers to trade, cut red tape and get nation-building projects off the ground. While it is true that the bill is critical to help grow our economy, indigenous communities' individual rights must be respected throughout the process. Can the Minister of Northern and Arctic Affairs outline how indigenous partners will be consulted and how these communities would benefit from this bill?"
"Mr. Chair, talking about affordable homes, when the minister was the mayor of Vancouver, homelessness went up by 38%. Is that the same model he is bringing to the rest of Canada?"
"Madam Speaker, today we found out that unemployment has climbed to 7%. Canada's youth face a 14.2% unemployment rate, and Canadian students returning to school this fall face a whopping 20.1% rate. The future outlook is even more grim. TD Bank expects 100,000 job losses this fall, and the Bank of Canada just stated that businesses are planning to significantly reduce hiring, yet the Liberals issued over 500,000 foreign student visas and 101,000 temporary work permits last year and have enabled over 300,000 pending asylum claims, which is roughly a city the size of Ottawa, of non-Canadian labour. This means even bigger competition for scarce jobs. This situation is not fair to anyone, and it is not the fault of the immigrants who came to Canada hoping for a better life. Rather, it is the Liberals' fault for breaking the immigration system while pushing inflationary spending and job-killing policies. The path forward is abundantly obvious. Conservatives demand that the Liberals immediately—"
"I, too, thank the hon. Member for South Devon (Caroline Voaden) for initiating this important debate, especially because dementia is the defining health and social care challenge of our time. It is now a leading cause of death in the UK, and one in two of us will be affected in our lifetime, whether through receiving a diagnosis ourselves, caring for a loved one, or both. Yet despite the scale and impact of the condition, people affected by dementia continue to face a fragmented system that all too often leaves them without the support they need when they need it most. Navigating a complex web of health and social care services is exhausting, and for many families it leads to crisis before help arrives. As the hon. Member explained, there is a postcode lottery, but I am proud of the fact that Wolverhampton is a dementia-friendly city. Through Dementia Connect, a personalised support service from the Alzheimer's Society, people have access to a wide range of help. Whether it involves emotional support, advice on benefits, connection to local support groups or practical tips for  living with dementia, the service makes a real difference, enhancing the quality of life for patients and their families. Alongside that, Wolverhampton's wider dementia pathway--our memory clinics, community health teams, Admiral Nurses, dementia cafes and carer support services--form a crucial safety net for families who are under immense pressure. To every NHS worker and social care professional, and to all the volunteers and the army of unpaid workers who provide support for patients and families in my constituency, I say ""Thank you."" Their knowledge, their lived experiences and their absolute dedication are deeply valued and appreciated. However, local services can only go so far, which is why I am urging the Government to make dementia a core priority in their upcoming NHS 10-year plan. I ask the Secretary of State and the Minister to listen to leading experts such as Dementia UK and Age UK; to ringfence funding for dementia specialist nurses in every NHS acute trust; to embed dementia specialist nurses, such as Admiral Nurses, in neighbourhood health centres; to tackle the delays and disparities in dementia diagnosis --as of April 2025, only 65% of those aged 65 or over who were estimated to have dementia had had a recorded diagnosis--to ensure investment in diagnostic capacity, including memory clinics; and to address the growing concern among older people and unpaid carers about their ability to access these vital services. Dementia is not just a clinical condition; it is a personal crisis that unfolds in so many living rooms, GP surgeries, hospital wards and care homes across our country. Let us not allow a ""geography roulette"" to determine the dignity that is needed by every person who is affected by dementia."
"The hon. Gentleman is right to raise the issue. Obviously, we carefully review and monitor any Chinese involvement in any elements of security. But it is right that we now include resilience in our overall definition of national spend, and act accordingly."
"My hon. Friend is a powerful voice and advocate for that approach and for Telford. He will welcome the additional UK investment under this Government, which means that we will have a new gun barrel factory in his constituency that will bring new jobs and prosperity. That is part of defence investment driving future economic growth in this country."
"in closing, I urge all Members to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the Conservative member of Parliament for Windsor West. I am deeply humbled by the trust the good people of Windsor have placed in me to represent their voices in Ottawa. It is in that spirit that I pay tribute to a man who left an indelible mark on our community and our country's auto industry. That man was Buzz Hargrove, who passed away on June 15. Buzz started in the line of the Windsor Assembly Plant and later rose through the ranks to become the president of the Canadian Auto Workers Union. He was a passionate advocate for working families, especially in Windsor, where the auto sector is not just a source of jobs but part of our identity. Buzz fought hard for wages, safer workplaces and the security that comes with a good contract. His legacy is felt not only in the assembly lines, but also in the strength and resilience of our communities. May Buzz rest in peace. His voice may have fallen silent, but his legacy will live on."
The hon. member for Saskatoon West has the floor.
"I thank my hon. Friend for her contribution. I hope that Ministers are listening, as the products produced in the three constituencies of my hon. Friends from Stoke-on-Trent are critical for our industrial future. My challenge to Government is to bring forward an industrial strategy that allows the whole nation to grow, but also resources and targets the towns that are crying out for change. I begin by demanding a skills revolution in our post-industrial areas. For much of the past century, areas such as mine were dominated by key industries. In Bassetlaw, we had thousands of men working down the pits while their wives, sisters and mothers headed into the big textile factories. The history of key industries is not exclusive to Bassetlaw--there are vital and historic British industries with their roots in many red wall areas. Ceramics, fishing, automotive, steel and shipping all dominated the midlands and the north of England. While some still remain, they are struggling, fighting an ongoing international race for cheap labour and parts, with successive Governments failing them time and again. In Bassetlaw, as the mines closed and the textile factories moved to countries with cheap labour, the employment opportunities shifted, with warehousing and logistics springing up on the old pit sites. At that time, skills provision, under the auspices of the Manpower Services Commission, developed into a simplistic system. It was literally controlled by the main employers, who wanted to mould the workforce into their own needs from age 16. In Bassetlaw, it was Tony Wilkinson of Wilko and Richard Budge of Budge Mining who ran the system. For a small number, skills training was via  the university route, with most never returning. The middle ground between the two was a low priority for Government, and the lazy solution has been to import the skills we need. That is the history of the past 14 years, where cheap imported skills have been used to meet industry's short-term needs, methodically sidelining local young people and adding to soaring legal migration. We have the kernel of an alternative, with high-skilled apprenticeships, but they are not yet ingrained across the system or the country."
"Mr. Chair, the minister either did not listen to the question or did not care about it. These are important questions that deserve answers. It is shameful that the minister responsible for the federal public service has no interest in talking about whether that service is operating effectively. The federal public service has grown by 40% in the last 10 years. Are Canadians getting their money's worth?"
I thank the hon. Member for that point of order. It is simply not the case that it has to be withdrawn on the Floor of the House; this has happened on numerous occasions. I call the Minister.
"Mr. Speaker, there is a lot in that question, and I thank the hon. member, for whom I have the utmost respect, for asking it. I have served on committees with the member, and she is always insightful. There are many benefits in this legislation. Obviously, increased labour mobility is key, but so are all kinds of cost benefits and the possibility of boosting productivity and decreasing prices for Canadians, which I know we are all concerned with. As well, there is the cost of living challenges, which I know my constituents and, I am sure, all residents in Canada are concerned about. We could also get major projects built a lot faster and give investors confidence to mobilize the capital that is needed. We could do big things with timelines that matter, within a short period of time, four or five years, which is fantastic. Canadians could actually realize the benefits of major projects as we move forward. There is much more I could talk about, but I think that is probably all I have time for right now."
"I wonder whether the Chancellor can help me. I want to write a letter to my constituents, and I do not know which story I should lead with--whether it is the rapid investment in our NHS to get more doctors' appointments, the money for our police to get more police on the streets, the transport investment to build new train stations, or the money to give hungry children in my constituency free school meals. Could she help me out? I only have one page. What should I start with?"
"Will the Lord Chancellor outline the steps being taken to recruit and retain probation officers, and to ensure that they have manageable caseloads and that their morale is improved? What programmes or partnerships are in place to help those on probation to access stable accommodation, and employment, training or education, so that they can go through the rehabilitation process and reduce their chances of reoffending?"
The hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean.

"Mr. Speaker, from 2015 to 2023, global oil and gas production grew 5%. Over the same time period, Canadian oil and gas production grew 29%. Of course, we welcome constructive suggestions for improvement, and we will be working with partners, provinces and proponents because better is always possible, but a total retreat from that which made development possible and markets accessible is not better. Demand for Canadian oil and gas grows because we develop our resources to high environmental and social standards, with indigenous partners and with an eye toward a robust, sustainable industry. Canada is at a pivotal moment, and we are taking a historically important step to establish ourselves as an energy superpower. That is why the government has introduced the one Canadian economy act: to remove federal barriers to internal trade and labour mobility and to advance projects of national interest. We expect that if the one Canadian economy act passes in the next few days, it will reassure investors that Canada and our energy sector are open for business. I am pleased to say that the voting record on the one Canadian economy act so far shows that the official opposition supports our work to lead the world in energy production and transmission. The government's vision is clear. We are focused on expanding our global energy reach beyond those who share our borders to those who share our values. Canadian conventional energy, LNG and hydrogen produced to the highest environmental and labour standards can displace more-polluting sources abroad, reduce global emissions and enhance energy security for our allies. While this work is being done, our government will keep investing in carbon capture, methane reduction and other technologies that help bring down emissions in the conventional energy sector. I would also like to point out the TMX project. A Liberal government invested in TMX to expand the access to Canada's conventional energy producers so they have global market access. Greater access to international markets has improved the overall value of Canadian oil, generating significant benefits for the entire country. We will also support clean energy and protect the environment because it is the right thing to do. It is a strong Canadian value. We will get more energy to market while fighting climate change through strategic investments in carbon capture, methane reduction and clean technologies. As the Prime Minister has said before, the government will get projects built. Of course, we will work with provinces, private sector proponents and indigenous communities. Indigenous rights will not be an afterthought; they are the bedrock of our nation. The protections in section 35 are enshrined in our Constitution, and the government stands steadfastly in support of them and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We need to work together. We are focused on growing our economy, carrying out our duty to our partners and supporting our energy producers. We must focus on delivery. The government will build more, build faster and build with confidence, confidence that will provide certainty to investors and confidence that will give Canadians a better, more prosperous future."
"I commend my hon. Friend for her words and for her service. The comments that were made at the weekend about our serving military personnel are outrageous, and I notice that there is not a single Reform MP here for this statement. Let me be absolutely clear: I believe that all parties present in the Chamber today back our forces. We do not take to Twitter to mock them. We respect service on a cross-party basis. We do not belittle senior officers based on their gender or experience. We need to be better than that. Just as we ask our armed forces to address cultural concerns, we need to be alive to that in our politics as well, and to call out misogyny wherever it rears its ugly head. Let us send a united message from all the parties present today that we back our armed forces, that we want to see a change in culture in our armed forces, and that we value the contribution of everyone who serves, especially those brave women who have done so much to secure our national security in recent years."
"Happy birthday, Mr Speaker. Moving from gas to electricity in home heating is an important part of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Yet at the Select Committee hearing last week, we heard real concerns that people in energy debt are unable to disconnect from gas and are therefore still stuck paying standing charges. Will the Minister say what the Government's plans are to remove that problem and ensure that more people can take up the opportunities presented by electrifying home heat?"
Order. I remind the hon. Member that she should not have referred to the Minister by name.
"Mr. Speaker, I am sure the member, just as I have, has attended citizenship ceremonies. It is always a very special moment for the people being sworn in as citizens. One thing I always talk about is how wonderful it is to be a Canadian. Now the Superior Court of Ontario has highlighted that there is a difference between a naturally born citizen and someone who comes here and becomes a citizen. I wonder if the member could provide his thoughts on the two-tier system that Harper set up and on the reason we have to get rid of it."
"Mr. Chair, we have been very clear to Canadians that we would balance the operating budget of this government within three years. I know the member is looking forward to the budget. It is going to be great. I know he is so anxious, but he will just have to wait a bit—"
"Mr. Speaker, I would also like to welcome my colleague from Elgin—St. Thomas—London South to the House. I enjoyed his speech. Can my colleague tell me how we have gotten to this point? In his opinion, why is the government introducing a bill that I would call too radical for the current situation, a bill that will amend about 15 acts and attack legislation affecting three different departments? Can he tell me what this government has done over the past 10 years to show that it takes border security and our refugee system seriously? I would like to hear his answer."
"Mr. Speaker, I welcome my colleague to the House of Commons. The member just spoke about the fact that Canadians decided to elect a government that will work for them and that will ensure that families and young people can buy homes. We have just introduced legislation in the House of Commons that responds to what Canadians have been calling for, an economy that works for all Canadians. I would like to know whether my colleague will support this bill. It is what Canadians have asked for. We are here. We are back in government. Of course, we are a minority government, but Canadians gave us an important mandate to build an economy that works for all the provinces of Canada. Will my colleague support this bill?"
I reserve the balance of my time.
"Mr. Chair, I will be able to get back to my colleague."
"Mr. Chair, In 2020, there was $2.4 billion in procurement in indigenous businesses in the oil sands alone. Does the minister acknowledge that economic reconciliation is important in the oil sands?"
"Happy birthday to you, Mr Speaker. The Government are targeting measures based on people's income, but will they look at the issue of rural homes? Many thousands of people live in poorly insulated homes in isolated areas; families there are left in the cold in the winter."
"The Lord Chancellor admitted in a recent interview with The Times that her sentencing reforms will create ""inevitable tensions"" with the Government's efforts to halve knife crime and rates of violence against women and girls. It sounds like she does not really believe in these reforms, which have been trotted out by David Gauke, the Prisons Minister in the other place and the Prison Reform Trust. Does the Lord Chancellor realise that none of them is elected, and that if this package fails to keep our streets safe and restore the criminal justice system, the country will hold her and this Government to account?"
"Madam Speaker, congratulations on your appointment as Deputy Speaker. Akiawenhrahk is the Wendat name for “river”. The Saint-Charles River runs through Wendake from north to south and throughout the riding of Louis-Saint-Laurent—Akiawenhrahk. I would also like to congratulate my colleague on his election, which is not his first, second or third election, but his fourth. My colleague summed things up very well. The debate took place in the middle of an election campaign. His leader , who is not my political friend but a man I respect, asked the Prime Minister a direct question in the middle of a debate. The Prime Minister was unable to give a proper answer in the middle of an election campaign. Despite everything, as he said himself, Quebeckers elected 44 out of 78 Liberal members, a strong Liberal majority. Why did Quebeckers, who knew that, vote for the Liberals?"
"Mr. Speaker, I have attended many trade shows and have come across many importers that have come across the CARM system, and yes, there are importers that are fully set up and using the system, but there are also other importers that are having some issues. This is what I brought up to our Minister of Public Safety . As I said, this impacts importers across Canada, and we want to make sure the system works accurately."
"I yield myself the balance of my time for closing. Mr. Speaker, there are masked agents in unmarked cars sent out, violating people's due process rights, as the courts have found. This includes all the way up to the Supreme Court. They are arresting Members of Congress. They are prosecuting Members of Congress for doing their jobs. They federalize the State National Guard when the police in Los Angeles and the elected officials are doing their jobs.  This is an authoritarian attack on constitutional democracy. We must get back to the rule of law. If nothing else, the Republicans should put up the plaque they committed to put up, honoring the police officers who defended American democracy, the Vice President of the United States, the House of Representatives, the Senate, and everybody in this room during the January 6 violent insurrection which Donald Trump was impeached for having incited. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  {time}  1010"
"Mr. Speaker, we request a recorded division."
"Mr. Chair, the issue of addictions is quite serious and impacts communities across Canada. It is a matter for the Minister of Health , but it is something that, of course, as a government we are—"
"I thank the Chief Secretary for his excellent work on this strategy, which will turbocharge confidence in the investment community while improving the lives, incomes and opportunities of my constituents in Darlington, which is exactly what I was elected to do. It will not surprise him to hear me ask politely for him to outline more detail on his ambition for the place-based approach, the Green Book reforms and the pilots that he has mentioned. Can we have one in Darlington, the home of many of his Treasury colleagues?"
I call Select Committee Member Charlie Maynard.
"I agree. We must not focus only on passenger numbers. It is also about connectivity, and about making sure that rural areas thrive."
"Mr. Speaker, right now the Liberals are criticizing Harper's first-generation limit and claiming they need to fix the system. I decided to go look at Hansard, and the Liberals passed a unanimous consent motion to pass Bill C-37 at all stages on February 15, 2008. Why is it that Liberals continue to mislead the House? Would the member agree that the Liberals today are a far cry from the Liberals from a generation ago, who believed in all-party consensus on immigration policies?"
"Mr. Chair, the answer is zero. How many ministers have resigned?"
"Will the Minister congratulate innovators such as my constituent James Hygate, who was recently awarded an OBE for his work on green fuels? Over genteel tea and cake--as the House can imagine, this happens all the time in Cheltenham--he told me of his plans to turn human faeces into SAF. He is an innovator at the leading edge, and he says that the Minister might be able to work with his friends in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to solve some of the problems that we have with sewage in our rivers, by taking it out at source. Is the Minister considering that as part of this legislation?"
"No, no, no. Please do not take advantage of the Chair. Points of order are meant to be a little bit more punchy--they are not full-blown statements. I take very seriously the points that have been made, and that is why I raised them myself at the time. I am very grateful to the right hon. Member for reiterating my words. I have no responsibility for the ministerial code. If the House so wishes, that needs to change, because unfortunately it makes a nonsense. There is a ministerial code, but it is not being kept to as we would expect. It is for this House to change the ministerial code if it wishes to do so, or I would be more than happy for the Government to change it if they cannot accept it, because we cannot have this continual breaking of the ministerial code. It is appalling and it is unacceptable. This is not a political point. In the end, I am here to uphold the rights of Back Benchers. Back Benchers should hear things first--if documents are to be given out, they should be given to MPs. I am here to support MPs, but unfortunately in this particular area I do not have the power to do so. I wish I had, because things would be different."
"As my hon. Friend said, this is a health area that I know well, and he has been the most amazing campaigner for Gloucester and the health service there since he became the Member of Parliament. He is absolutely right: dentistry is a key worry. It is one of the key areas that the Conservative party neglected for 14 years. That is why it was a manifesto commitment, and why I was able to outline today that meeting the target of 700,000 is front and centre, and part of the plan as we go forward. I know that the Minister for Care, who is responsible for dentistry, is keen to meet many hon. Members, and I will make sure he has heard that request."
"What assessment she has made of the potential implications for her policies of StandWithUs UK's ""Voice of Students 2024/25"" report on antisemitism on university campuses."
"Mr. Chair, it has been a challenging time across Canada for decades. Certainly, in Vancouver during my time as mayor, we were at the very front end of what has become a housing crisis across Canada. The lack of affordability has permeated the country over several decades. That is why, with this new government, part of the reason I am standing here, elected by my constituents, is to bring out the learnings I had as a mayor, and formerly an MLA, in understanding how the system works at the city and provincial levels. I had challenges in my time working with previous federal governments that were not committed to affordable housing at the scale that was required. It was certainly the case with the Conservative governments I was dealing with from 2008 to 2015. It was very difficult to get any support for affordable housing from the federal government. The new Government of Canada is very focused on delivering—"
"I will briefly, but he will let me finish this point. The proposals have been put forward by all parties to ensure that the legislation is better and more efficient, but fundamentally serves the people who send  us here and who want to see differences in the way in which their country is run. We argue that this legislation does not do that, we argue that this is a massive centralising overreach advocated by the Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, and we stand fundamentally against it."
"I am a member of the all-party parliamentary group on genetic haemochromatosis, and my constituent Lorraine asked me to attend the debate. She suffers from the disease, and has found a way to manage it by donating blood regularly. She is pleased that genetic testing enabled her to know about her condition so she did not suffer severe organ damage, which can affect many people with the disease. Does my hon. Friend agree that genetic testing for those who are more likely to be diagnosed is essential if we are to help people lead healthy lives without the need for medical intervention?"
The hon. member.
"What are the principal differences between this Government's groundbreaking plan to introduce mental health support teams to schools and the previous Government's already in-progress programme to deliver mental health support teams to schools? As I like this Minister, Mr Speaker, let me give him a hint: this has been a rhetorical question."
"I thank the Minister for his answer. In a recent survey on the impact of the cost of living on childhood in Blackpool, six in 10 respondents told me that they were worried about children in their care becoming involved in crime or antisocial behaviour. The link between deprivation and crime is clear, and it highlights the urgent need for a dedicated cross-Government strategy to improve the lives of young people in Blackpool and across the country. What steps is the Minister taking, alongside other colleagues in Government, to ensure co-ordinated action to tackle youth crime and reoffending rates in vulnerable communities such as Blackpool?"
"The point of my amendment is to make sure that a future Secretary of State would have to come before the House with primary legislation. Report stage is not about the principles of the Bill. It is not about whether a Member may, in principle, support the idea of assisted dying, as Mr Speaker will point out to everybody who strays from the amendments. It is about the individual Bill before us today. We have to ask: what will it mean in the real world for our very real constituents?"
"I referred to the machinery of Government change that we announced a few days ago. We are building up a real sense of expertise in DSIT, and we thought it made sense to make that change to bring together the operational and security parts of cyber policy. I am sure that my colleagues in DSIT are well aware of the hon. Member's views and of the importance of the issues that he raised."
"I am very conscious of the need to invest in and improve public transport in Stockport, and if the council would like to write to me with any relevant information, I will gladly consider it. I also point out that our investment in transport for city regions, announced a couple of weeks, is good news for Stockport; Metrolink will be extended to the town. I hope the hon. Gentleman will welcome that as good news for his constituents."
"I rise today to congratulate the Deputy Chief of Army Reserve, Major General Deborah ``Deb'' Kotulich on her retirement from the U.S. Army Reserve. Major General Kotulich's 35-year career has been characterized by exceptionally meritorious service while serving in positions of increasing responsibility and culminating as the Deputy Chief of Army Reserve. A native of New Jersey and West Point graduate, Major General Kotulich's distinguished service has impacted the lives of countless soldiers and their families. And she has served in several key leadership roles throughout her remarkable career. She served as the Director of the Army Recruiting and Retention Task Force, where she successfully integrated and synchronized efforts across the Army Enterprise to address the recruiting crisis that impacted recruiting for several years. During the pandemic, she diligently served as the Director for Supply, Production, and Distribution for COVID-19 Vaccine and Therapeutics for the Countermeasures Acceleration Group (CAG), formerly known as Operation Warp Speed. There, she led a joint and interagency team that worked ``hand-in-glove'' with industry partners to deliver millions of life-saving doses and treatments to the American people and globally. In addition to the CAG, Major General Kotulich has served in several joint positions to include Chief of Staff at the United States Transportation Command and three different assignments at the Defense Logistics Agency. Her command tours include: The 143rd Sustainment Command (Expeditionary), Orlando, Florida; The 77th Sustainment Brigade, Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey; The 655th Regional Support Group, Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts; The 359th Transportation Battalion (Terminal), Fort Eustis, Virginia; and Headquarters Company, 55th Materiel Management Center (Theater Sustainment Command), Fort Belvoir, Virginia. While in command of the 143rd Sustainment Command (Expeditionary), Major General Kotulich deployed her headquarters to Kuwait in support of Operations Freedom's Sentinel, Inherent Resolve, and Spartan Shield. During her tour, she was dual hatted as the Deputy Commanding General of the 1st Theater Sustainment Command and Commanding General of the 143rd Sustainment Command (Expeditionary). And was responsible for more than 10,000 Servicemembers, Civilians, and Contractors deployed throughout the Central Command Theater of Operation. Her other deployments were in 2007 to the CENTCOM Deployment Distribution Operations Center (CDDOC) at Camp Arifjan and Kuwait in support of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. And in 2004 to Balad, Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom II, where she served as an operational plans officer at the 13th Corps Support Command. I want to thank Major General Kotulich for her distinguished service, and her professionalism and passion for service in every role she has filled throughout her prestigious career. Part of what makes the U.S. military the greatest in the world is that servicemembers, like Major General Kotulich, voluntarily dedicate their lives to serve and sacrifice for this country. I also want to thank her wife, Penelope Smith, and two daughters, Rachel and Devan, for their unwavering support. I wish Major General Kotulich and her family all the best in what I hope to be a restful and enjoyable future."
"Mr. Chair, of course, though, the minister has a real leadership role here. The trucking industry itself and trucking businesses in my community are asking and expecting, based on the promises made by the Liberals in the last election, the Prime Minister himself and the minister, that there will be serious leadership and results by Canada Day. Those are the promises that were made by the Liberal Prime Minister. One example is daylight shipping restrictions. For safety reasons with certain shipments, they can only be shipped across Canada during the day. The problem is that the definition is not streamlined across the country; each province has a different definition of what constitutes daylight driving hours. What has the minister done to show leadership to streamline and harmonize the definition of daylight shipping hours?"
"When the Bank of Scotland branch closes later this year in Pitlochry, the town will desperately need a banking hub. That is why I was disappointed that the independent assessor and Link assessed only access to cash, not access to banking. I challenged Link on that, and it said that that is because of the mandate set for it by the Financial Conduct Authority; so I challenged the FCA on that, and it said that that is because of the regulatory framework in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023; so I challenged the Treasury on that and asked it to change its regulatory framework and imposition on the FCA. The Treasury said it will not do that. In opposition, Labour tabled an amendment to the Financial Services and Markets Bill that would have mandated a survey of access to banking services, not just access to cash. Can we have a debate in Government time about how we fix this utter guddle?"
"The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster very skilfully talked about the future, rather than the past year. I will let him know that during the past year, the number of roles in his Department and its agencies has increased by 828. That cannot give the House a great deal of confidence that his future cuts will be effective. Will he guarantee that that is a one-off and that he will go back and ensure that the Cabinet Office is actually reduced in size?"
"The hon. member for King—Vaughan, a very brief answer."
"Mr. Speaker, there is good news for Canadian youth this summer. In addition to the 70,000 Canada summer jobs, we are adding 6,000 more all across the country. We know that this is an emergency valve for youth unemployment, which is indeed rising. However, what will not help is voting against the measures that Canadians are looking for this summer. What we know is that Canadians vote every single time there is an opportunity to help the constituents in their riding. We will not do that; we will stand up for Canadian families."
"Mr. Chair, the minister knows there are fewer housing starts than that. Rents have more than doubled across the country. Canadians cannot afford their mortgages or their rent. International students are sleeping under bridges or in tents due to the housing shortage. Why is the minister issuing hundreds of thousands more foreign student visas this year?"
"My hon. Friend speaks of the views of constituents. At a very well attended public meeting of my constituents just before Second Reading, one key question they wanted an answer to was how the Bill could prevent vulnerable people from being coerced into taking a decision to end their life. Does she agree that as the Bill has gone through Parliament, it has been strengthened with safeguards against coercion, and that the impact assessment says that through the Bill, we would have the strongest safeguards of any jurisdiction in the world?"
"Mr. Speaker, we need to look at every possible measure to support the steel and aluminum sector. That is why we are having intense discussions with our colleagues. Both he and I want the same thing. I know him, and I know that he, too, wants to stand up for workers in the industry. We have the same goal. That is why we are working hand in hand with the industry."
Is that agreed?
"Mr. Chair, the minister said earlier, and kept trying to claim, that he does not approve projects, but his own bill says he does. Is that not true?"
"My right hon. Friend is entirely correct. The Royal College of Physicians has said: ""Medicines prescribed and administered in assisted dying must be regulated for safety and efficacy for this use."" If that is a requirement of the Royal College of Physicians, we in the House should take it seriously and put it into the Bill. I will now draw my remarks to a close, but I should say that I also support amendment 99, which would require a report on the drug's effects before Parliament approves the regulation, as well as a number of the other amendments, which hopefully would remove the wide-ranging Henry VIII powers currently in the Bill. In the light of all that I have said, I remain deeply sceptical as to whether the Bill, in its current state, provides the robust, protective and operationally sound framework that such a profound societal change deserves."
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).
What steps she is taking to help ensure that the transport system supports economic growth.
"My hon. Friend is right in what she says. Those of us who are opposed to the death penalty, for example, are against it because we do not believe in the infallibility of the state. The state can get things wrong; professionals can get things wrong--and when they do, there should be a proven, clear path as to how that wrongdoing can be identified, to try to ensure that it does not occur again."
"Madam Speaker, I salute my colleague and congratulate her on her re-election. Under the Harper government, there were plans to cut the number of officers at the border. That is what it says in CBSA's 2015 report on plans and priorities. Now that the Conservative Party is in opposition, it seems to have taken the opposite position. They agree that we need more staff to have more security at the borders. I would like my colleague to simply explain to me why it was a priority to reduce staff when the Conservative Party was in government, but now that they are in opposition, they agree with increasing staff."
What discussions he has had with the Secretary of State for Education on AI in schools.
"Somerset Youth Justice Service recently got a ""requires improvement"" rating from His Majesty's inspectorate of probation. The situation is clearly damaging young offenders' chances of rehabilitation, so what steps is the Department taking to improve SYJS and support young offenders in Somerset?"
"I rise in support of H. Res. 519 introduced by Congresswoman Kelly Morrison and the Minnesota delegation. I join my colleagues in condemning the attack that took the lives of Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and wounded Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Let me say this loud and clear as so many have said today. There is no place in our democracy for political violence. It violates our shared humanity. The violence we saw in Minnesota is a consequence of those in power irresponsibly stoking division and fermenting hate against political opponents. I also rise today to amplify the resolution's call that we all reaffirm our commitment to a democracy where violent rhetoric and acts like this are not tolerated. Their call is echoed in my resolution to honor the life of Wadee Alfayoumi, a 6-year-old boy from Illinois whose life was taken in the act of anti-Palestinian violence. It is the duty of elected officials and the media to tell the truth without dehumanizing rhetoric when informing the public of factual information. We know that dehumanizing rhetoric can fuel sentiments of hate that result in violence, and each tragedy adds to a litany of evidence that our safety and our security are interconnected. Dehumanizing rhetoric makes us all less safe. Whether it be Truth Social polls, on Twitter or anywhere else, we all have a responsibility to denounce political violence in all its forms. It is our duty to denounce, and we will continue to reject, all forms of hate-fueled violence from Plainfield, Illinois to Gaza to Israel to D.C. to Boulder to Minneapolis and everywhere in between. It is our responsibility, and I thank the sponsors for bringing this resolution."
"Mr. Chair, all the details are included in the main estimates. I would advise my colleague to—"
"I want to pick up on the point that my colleague from Washington State touched on. Everybody ought to understand that this is the nuclear option. It is just hidden behind a whole lot of Washington, DC, lingo. The only difference is, instead of pressing a big nuclear button right at the beginning of the Congress, Republicans decided that they would hide behind the cloak of Senate procedure and go nuclear for every individual bill they want to pass on party lines. I just say to my colleagues: There is going to be a lot of horrendous messes to clean up after this legislation. But my colleagues need to understand that the move, as my colleague from Washington State has said, cuts both ways. I yield the floor.  Unanimous Consent Agreement"
"My hon. Friend has been a big advocate of reforms to the Green Book, and after setting up the consultation in January, we are pleased to be able to announce changes today to get more investment into places such as Gateshead and Whickham in the north of England. My hon. Friend is also a big champion for free school meals. I am really pleased that in the spending review 500,000 more children will get free school meals, lifting 100,000 children out of poverty."
"My hon. Friend will not be surprised that I completely agree with her. Today, we have announced a new golden age of nuclear power in this country after decades of dither and delay; in fact, I think that the last switch-on of a nuclear power station was before I was even born. [Interruption.] It is not that long ago. We are driving forward the real potential that we see in nuclear power, and the Secretary of State will make a statement on that later. That is how we deliver thousands of well-paid, skilled jobs across the country and the important energy security that we need. I hope that we will see SMRs in every part of the United Kingdom, including in Scotland."
"In the spirit of saying things that are not true and making brazen statements, I wonder whether the hon. Member can get on to the bit of his speech  where he pretends that the Conservative Government invested more in our schools."
"Sir Jon Cunliffe's interim report, published yesterday, laid out the fundamental changes needed for our water sector. That is felt no more acutely than in my constituency of Chichester. We have a harbour that is in an unfavourable, declining condition and sewage is blighting our tourism industry. With water bills from Southern Water rising by 47% for my constituents, can the Prime Minister tell them when they can expect to see the real change that this Government promised and our waterways cleaned up for good?"
"The Government have pledged to enhance the record of the previous Conservative Government and uphold animal  welfare. Retained European regulations currently prohibit the handling of chickens by their legs, but in their first act of animal welfare, the Government are proposing to pass regulations to permit that harmful practice. Will the Leader of the House ask the agriculture Minister to write to me--and place a copy of the letter in the Library --to explain why the Government are choosing to lower the legal standard rather than to uphold the law and protect animal welfare?"
"Mr. Chair, again, I have the CBC article right here. The minister asked for a full removal of caps on immigrants. Would she agree that the number of people coming into Canada must be immediately and massively reduced?"
"Mr. Speaker, Canadians are justifiably frustrated when it comes to the housing file after 10 years of the Liberal government being in power. When the government was first elected, it proposed an $80-billion plus national housing strategy. The results were that housing costs doubled, rents doubled and mortgage payments doubled. To compound this failure, the Liberals then pledged an over $4-billion housing accelerator fund, which the former housing minister admitted was not designed to build homes. I guess he was right. According to Statistics Canada, more homes were built in 1972 than in 2022. During the campaign, the Liberals took our idea of removing the GST from new home sales, but they did not go far enough. They also pledged to create a new housing entity. How much comfort and confidence should Canadians have in the government to create a new bureaucratic entity when it demonstrated it cannot even run a passport office? Now, TD Bank is saying they cannot build the—"
"Mr. Speaker, we have a wonderful finance minister . The budget is going to be delivered by our finance minister and our Prime Minister . We will also remove the goods and services tax for first-time homebuyers on new homes valued up to $1 million, saving them up to $50,000, and lower the GST for first-time homebuyers on new homes valued between $1 million and $1.5 million. That is another point of action. This would provide a significant increase to the already substantial federal tax support available to first-time homebuyers through programs such as the first home savings account, the RRSP homebuyers' plan and first-time homebuyers' tax credit. By doing this, we would be helping more young people and young families achieve their dream of owning a home of their own. We are absolutely focused and committed to doing that. We are also removing the consumer carbon price from law, following its cancellation, effective April 1. Yes, I know the party opposite said that we would never do it, that we were going to put it back on. We did it. We removed the GST from new homes and made the tax cut. These moves are substantial for Canadians. We want to deliver change with measures that cut taxes, bring down costs and put money back into the pockets of Canadians. We are absolutely focused and committed to doing that. These are some of the ways the government is acting now to make life more affordable. The government will also continue to protect the programs that are already saving families thousands of dollars every year. Those include child care, pharmacare, dental care and the Canada child benefit, which are saving families thousands, and which the Conservatives voted against. Child care was not supported. They voted against dental care. Let us be clear. All of us on this side, as Liberals, believe that government has a role to play in Canadians' lives. We believe that government can come forth with transformational programs that help Canadians from coast to coast to coast. The other party members apparently do not, because they did not support the programs. We hear a lot about the price of housing, yet they voted against the rapid housing initiative. They voted against the coinvestment fund. For the housing accelerator fund, which is helping communities, villages and towns from coast to coast to coast, they voted against. Then their leader tells the members not to advocate for that program in their ridings. We are committed to delivering for Canadians. We are focused on delivering for Canadians. Straight-up, my constituency office has not had five calls about the budget. I have had many calls about the tax cut, many calls about the GST removal on new homes and many calls about the consumer carbon price being eliminated. Do members think Canadians are calling my office in Saint John—Kennebecasis wondering why there is no budget right now when, as I would argue, one of the leading economists in the world has their hands on the wheel? His Majesty said, during the Speech from the Throne, “In all of [our] actions, the Government will be guided by a new fiscal discipline: spend less so Canadians can invest more.” We will balance the government's operating budget over the next three years by cutting waste, capping the public service, ending duplication and deploying technology to improve public sector productivity. To this end, the Liberals have committed to delivering the details of our plan in the fall. It is not as though it would be three years in the future or 10 years in the future, as the party opposite makes it seem. This fall, we will deliver the budget. Today we are debating the merits of releasing a budget this spring. Simply put, there is not much value in rushing to a budget within a narrow window of just a few weeks. There are other considerations that must be weighed in order to deliver a comprehensive and detailed budget. Substantially advancing our discussions with the Americans would provide greater clarity. We all know those discussions are happening. The upcoming NATO summit is crucial for Canada's security and has significant budgetary implications. I think every member of this House will be pleased with the Prime Minister 's announcement about the 2% commitment on spending with NATO. These are the kinds of things happening on a day in, day out basis. Yes, it is difficult to table a budget right this minute. One of the key priorities we have emphasized and have been working on since the start of our mandate is improving government spending efficiency. We are looking for areas to reduce costs and enhance the productivity of the public service. Day-to-day government spending, the government's operating budget, has been growing by 9% every year. The government will introduce measures to bring it to below 2%. The Liberals are launching these priorities while preparing the budget. Defence spending, economic outcomes and efficiency are all factors that will be captured. By taking these steps, we will have a much stronger, ambitious, effective budget this fall. In parallel, the government will take a series of measures to catalyze new investment to create better jobs and higher incomes for Canadians. As we have stated before, our government's overreaching goal, its core mission, is to build the strongest economy in the G7. We are committed to building a strong economy. The stronger our economy is, the more we can help Canadians with transformational programs. It starts with creating one Canadian economy out of 13. We must bring down the trade barriers. Internal barriers to trade and labour mobility cost Canada as much as $200 billion each year. That is why we have introduced legislation to remove all federal barriers to internal trade and labour mobility. As many hon. members would have noticed last week, to build Canada strong, the government is also working closely with provinces, territories and indigenous peoples to identify and catalyze projects of national significance. What an exciting time for our country. I talked to New Brunswick's premier about projects that the Liberals want to move forward with for New Brunswick, for Atlantic Canada. Maybe we can do something with Quebec and Ontario at the same time. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources say we will not be defined by delay. We will be defined by delivery. We will be judged by actions, not words. I am absolutely excited; I am absolutely convinced that our future is very bright. The geopolitical landscape in our world has changed, most likely forever. Relationships that we used to have, we cannot count on. Trade relationships that we used to have are gone. No country, probably, is at greater risk than Canada. However, if we invest, grow, build and move forward with passion and aggression, and we are not afraid to break a few things along the way, then the future of our country will be very bright. Our government will provide additional details on these efforts and a spending plan in due course as it prepares for a comprehensive federal budget in the fall. I thank members. I do have my tie on; I have three of them now. I want to say that I am very blessed to be here and to have the opportunity to speak to everyone this morning."
"I rise today to honor a group of heroes that have been a lifeline for the people of Lubbock County for 50 years: the UMC Emergency Medical Services team. Since their first 911 response back in November 1975, well before the University Medical Center Hospital even opened its doors, UMC EMS has been on the front lines of saving lives and serving our communities in west Texas. We are fortunate to have the highest level of healthcare and emergency response professionals protecting our families. In fact, UMC EMS is one of just 46 EMS systems worldwide with a dual accreditation. Their team has earned the American Heart Association's Mission: Lifeline Gold Award every year since 2019, a well-deserved honor. Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone at UMC EMS, past and present, for their unparalleled care, for their endless compassion, and most of all, their commitment to excellence and service to the people of west Texas. I congratulate them on 50 years of incomparable service, and here is to 50 more. God bless America, and go west Texas.  Congratulating Coahoma High School Bulldogettes"
Will the hon. Member give way?
"I spoke to our ambassadors and teams across the region this morning, because I recognise that this is a worrying and stressful time in all those areas. That is why my central message and task is to de-escalate. We need more light and less heat."
"Mr. Speaker, the Ontario Superior Court ruling that ostensibly was the genesis of this legislation said it was unconstitutional for Canada to deny automatic citizenship to children born abroad to parents who were also born overseas but have a substantial connection to Canada. Could my colleague describe what her government believes “substantial connection to Canada” means, and where that is contained in the bill?"
"The Liberal Democrats welcome the publication of the Government's national security strategy, because we recognise that we are living in a world that is less stable and more insecure now than at any time since the end of the cold war. Putin's forces continue to wage their war in Ukraine, the middle east is teetering on the precipice of a fully-fledged regional war, and the actions of the United States under an unreliable President Trump are putting an enormous strain on the post-war settlement from which we have benefited so much. The nature of the threats we face continues to evolve, as has become immensely clear to millions of people across the country with the recent cyber-attacks on Marks and Spencer and the Co-op, and in other countries we have seen attempts by authoritarian states to meddle in free and fair elections. That is why we welcome so much of what is contained in the strategy. It is also why the Liberal Democrats have welcomed the Government's decision to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, although we have urged Ministers to go further. Given the new NATO target of 5% of GDP, will the Government now urgently convene cross-party talks to establish a consensus on how to get there? We need to show our adversaries we are serious about that commitment. The strategy also has a welcome focus on resilience, something especially important given not just the scale of the threat we face but its varied nature. Will the Minister look at steps taken by our allies such as Estonia to inform their populations about how to deal with those threats, should they arise? To reflect the threat posed to our democracy by hostile actors, will he make protecting our democracy a national security priority? I also note the importance that the review places on sovereign independent capabilities. Is that an admission from the Government that, under President Trump, the United States is no longer a reliable ally? Will the assessment be carried over into defence procurement, where we look to maintain an inextricably close bond with the United States?"
"I want to take a moment to respond to the statement put out by California's High-Speed Rail Authority in response to the audit from the Department of Transportation that came out yesterday. This audit began a few months ago. I joined Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy in Los Angeles to announce the investigation into California's 17-year-long failure to build anything despite receiving massive funding at the State and Federal levels. The audit specifically looked at what happened to the $4 billion in Federal funds that were provided through recent grants. The result of the audit showed that the State is woefully out of compliance, that it has built nothing, and that there is no viable path forward for the project; therefore, those grants can now be terminated. The High-Speed Rail Authority came out with this statement, which, frankly, defies belief. It said: ``The Authority strongly disagrees with the [Federal Rail Administration's] conclusions, which are misguided and do not reflect the substantial progress made to deliver high-speed rail in California.'' Mr. Speaker, I almost cannot believe those words: ``the substantial progress to deliver high-speed rail in California.'' What progress has been made, let alone substantial progress? There literally has not been any track laid in 17 years. There has not been one passenger in 17 years. There have been five CEOs of the rail authority, by the way, so the CEOs of the rail authority outnumber the passengers 5-0. Mr. Speaker, $17 billion has been spent already, and literally nothing has been built. By the way, the initial projection was that this thing was going to be done in 2020. That is what we were told when it was proposed in 2008, that by the year 2020, we will have a high-speed rail system, that you could hop on it in Los Angeles, and it will take you swiftly to San Francisco. Wouldn't that be nice? We are now in the year 2025, and nothing has been built. We are 5 years past the deadline for the whole thing to be done. Nothing has been built, and the rail authority has the audacity to claim that substantial progress has been made. By the way, we were also told that, by the year 2030, we would have 100 million riders per year. We now know for a fact that the number of riders per year by the year 2030 will be 100 million less than forecast. There will be zero riders still by the year 2030. We are told, no, no, substantial progress has been made.  {time}  1150  Mr. Speaker, how do we know there will be no riders by the year 2030? The rail authority has said so itself. It has continued to scale back its initial leg of the system but has continued to push back the completion date for that initial segment. The initial segment of the system from Bakersfield to Merced would span 119 miles. For those who are not from California, these are not exactly population centers. They have set a deadline to complete that by 2033. They are now saying that even that deadline will not be met. Mr. Speaker, in 2033, we will not even have the initial segment of 119 miles from Bakersfield to Merced. By 2020, we were initially promised we would have the whole thing from L.A. to San Francisco. By 2030, we would have 100 million riders. The CEO of the rail authority came out recently and said he has a new and very ambitious plan that by the year 2045, 20 years from now, not only will we have this Bakersfield to Merced segment done but we will also have Gilroy to Palmdale. For those who don't know California geography, where are these places? Neither is especially close to San Francisco or Los Angeles. Let's give him the benefit of the doubt. Let's assume this actually happens. By 2045, we have Palmdale to Gilroy. There is no reason to believe that will be true since every single other deadline has been missed and has been pushed back. Let's give him the benefit of the doubt. They work hard for 20 years. They continue to spend tens of billions of dollars. They build Palmdale to Gilroy by 2045. How exactly would we utilize this system if we wanted to go from L.A. to San Francisco? Here is what we would have to do. We would have to get on one rail system. It would take about 2 hours to get from L.A. to Palmdale. A passenger would then have to get off and hop onto the high-speed train. They probably have to wait for it. That would take about 2 hours to then get to Gilroy. At Gilroy, a person would get off and wait for another train, one that is not a high-speed one. That would take them from Gilroy into San Francisco. Overall, the trip at a minimum would take 6 hours and would span three different transit systems. It wouldn't be doable until 2045 at a minimum. Right now, today, for decades, a traveler could take a flight on Southwest or several other airlines from L.A. to San Francisco in about an hour. No, we are told that this vision, this new plan, amounts to substantial progress such that the results of the audit are--let's see, what were the words here?--misguided. They do not reflect the substantial progress that has been made. By the way, the Governor has hired a gentleman who specifically goes around on X attacking people like me who criticize anything that the Governor is for. Newsom is completely for spending billions and billions on the high-speed rail. In fact, he just doubled the amount that will be spent this year through the cap-and-trade fund. This gentleman responded to my criticism of the high-speed rail by saying that we are creating all these jobs. That is what this is about. I am all for creating jobs. In fact, it would be great if we had more jobs in California. As it is, under Governor Newsom, California has the highest unemployment rate in the country. A recent jobs report showed literally zero job growth in California. I would love to create more jobs. We could create jobs by hiring people to dig a hole and hire more people to come and fill the dirt back in, which isn't that far from what is actually happening with the high-speed rail.  It is better to create jobs doing something that actually creates value, that improves the quality of life of Californians, and that stimulates economic activity. Then there are actually more jobs because those are jobs associated with the economic activity that results from having something useful when it comes to transportation. I do believe that this compliance review is the beginning of the end for high-speed rail in California. I am now calling on the House to pass my bill which provides that not only will Federal funds continue to be unavailable during this administration but that the project will be ineligible for any further Federal funding going forward. Once we eliminate the possibility of future Federal funding, the State will have no choice but to acknowledge reality and finally wind down this embarrassing and disastrous project. This is the worst public infrastructure failure in U.S. history. They will use those funds where they are truly needed, which is on our roads, on our other transportation infrastructure, or, frankly, on literally anything else.  Grading for Equity Initiative"
"Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank my colleague from Madawaska—Restigouche. I was totally impressed yesterday when he asked his question with passion and clarity. I congratulate him on his election to the House of Commons. The dental care plan is very important for affordability. Helping first-time homebuyers is very important. Outside Quebec, it is the national child care program that is very important. In Quebec, we are used to it since we have had it for a generation, and I am pleased that the federal government is following suit."
"on Monday afternoon, the Senate Finance Committee released the text of the centerpiece of our reconciliation bill, making the tax relief we passed in 2017 permanent. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced tax rates for every income bracket, doubled the child tax credit, and nearly doubled the standard deduction. That, of course, meant more money in Americans' pockets. But those lower tax rates and the larger standard deduction and the child tax credit are set to expire at the end of this year, and if we don't take action, American families will be facing a massive tax hike starting in 2026. Americans making less than $400,000 a year would face a $2.6 trillion tax hike. A typical family of four making $80,000 would need to send an additional $1,700 to Uncle Sam--$1,700. Republicans promised the American people that we won't let that happen. With the release of the Finance Committee text, we are one step closer to delivering on that promise. Our bill will extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's lower tax rates. It will extend the doubled child tax credit. It will extend the nearly doubled standard deduction--but not just extend them, Mr. President, make them permanent. Extending the lower tax rates or the standard deduction was never going to be enough for Republicans. We are making the lower tax rates and the doubled child tax credit and the increased standard deduction permanent so that American families do not have to worry about another looming tax hike a few years down the road. And we are actually going even further by increasing the child tax credit by another $200--again, on a permanent basis. Mr. President, that is not all we are doing. We are always going to make life better for the American people by growing our economy. In addition to cutting tax rates for hard-working Americans, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also implemented historic reform of the business side of the Tax Code. We lowered tax rates for owners of small and medium-sized businesses, farms, and ranches and made it easier for them to recover the cost of investing in their businesses, which in turn freed up cash for them to invest in their operations and their workers. We lowered our Nation's massive corporate tax rate--which, prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world--to make American businesses more competitive in the global economy and empower them to invest in wages and benefits for their workers. And we brought our international tax system into the 21st century so that American businesses would no longer be operating at a disadvantage next to their foreign counterparts. Mr. President, it worked. In the wake of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our economy grew at a substantially better rate than projected. Real wages increased, unemployment fell to a 50-year low, the poverty rate fell to the lowest level ever recorded, and business investment increased. Everywhere you looked, there was positive economic news. When we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we were able to make some of that business tax relief permanent. But like the individual tax relief, other provisions have either already expired, are expiring at the end of this year, or are in the process of phasing out. That includes lower tax rates for small and medium-sized businesses, the section 199A small business tax deduction, and full expensing for new capital investment and domestic research and development. Our legislation will permanently extend these key provisions. In between these and other new pro-growth policies, like a provision to boost domestic manufacturing by implementing full expensing for new factories and factory improvements, we can expect to see further economic growth and more jobs and opportunities for American workers. The Council of Economic Advisers, which accurately predicted the economic and wage growth that we achieved in the wake of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is forecasting 2.9 percent to 3.5 percent long-run GDP as a result of our legislation. That means more jobs, better wages--as much as a $13,327 increase for a typical family--and more opportunities for American workers. It also means more revenue for the Federal Government--but revenue created the right way, through economic growth, not through higher taxes. And I should mention that, yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office released a new H.R. 1 analysis, which characteristically underestimates the economic growth--and hence the revenue--this bill will provide. CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, did the same thing with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, when it estimated revenues would be $1.5 trillion lower than what they have actually been. The Council of Economic Advisers, by contrast--which was most accurate in its modeling of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's effects, including its effect on revenue--tells us that passage of our legislation will increase Federal revenues by $4.1 trillion, more than enough to offset the CBO's deficit estimate. Mr. President, in addition to promising to make the 2017 tax relief permanent, President Trump outlined multiple other tax proposals on the campaign trail--proposals which were endorsed by the American people with his strong win in November. And with this bill, we are delivering on those promises. We are suspending taxes on tips for millions of tip workers. We are suspending taxes on overtime for millions of hourly workers. We are suspending taxes on auto loan interest when you buy a new car manufactured in theUnited States. And we are increasing the standard deduction for millions of low- and middle-income seniors, making their retirement a little easier and more prosperous. We are also implementing a program to create savings accounts for newborns, with an initial deposit of $1,000 to help parents save and invest for their children's future needs. Mr. President, everything we are doing in this bill is for the sake of making America stronger and more prosperous. And nowhere is that more true than when it comes to the tax portion--the centerpiece--of our bill. The tax provisions in our bill--from the permanent extension of the lower tax rates to the increased child tax credit, to the permanent tax relief for small and medium-sized businesses--will help bring security to American families and prosperity to our country. Working Americans--working Americans--are going to have a better life because of this legislation. I am proud to be a part of permanently extending and upgrading the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With that, I want to thank Chairman Crapo and his members on the Senate Finance Committee for their incredible work on the tax portion of our upcoming bill. I look forward to delivering permanent tax relief for hard-working Americans and American businesses in the very near future. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
"Oh, oh!"
"I stand with my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield Central (Abtisam Mohamed). She and I were denied entry to Israel only two months ago, and one of the reasons given  was our advocacy for the sanctions that the Government have introduced today. I stand by my comments and by the Government's decisive action today. As the Minister has mentioned, it is important that this action has been taken to uphold the rights of Palestinians. The UK, along with its international allies, can take further action by recognising the state of Palestine. What more can the Minister do--and what more can all of us in this House do--to press our international allies to come to that decision collectively?"
"Mr. Chair, let me help the minister: It was $859,292 to buy a home in Nanaimo as of May 2025, up from $362,000 in 2015. Does the minister know the current median household income in Nanaimo?"
"I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for his service in the RAF, and I am sure that he is thinking about his former colleagues at RAF Akrotiri and across our two sovereign bases in the area, and in particular about our bilateral defence partnerships with so many countries in the region. I am pleased to make it crystal clear that the path through this is a diplomatic one: it is for Iran to return to negotiation and to recognise the power of the global community being absolutely clear that it cannot have a nuclear weapon."
The hon. member.
"United Auctions in my constituency has recently become the UK's first employee-owned livestock auctioneer. Will the Secretary of State commit to doing more to encourage employee ownership models as a great option for rural businesses that want to thrive, attract new talent and remain rooted in the communities that they serve? Will he also congratulate the new owners?"
"Mr. Chair, the Liberals have a big endeavour ahead of us to get to 500,000 housing starts a year, but we are committed to getting there, working with industry and all the provincial and—"
"I will not give away any more. I want to bring our remarks to a close because, as hon. Members are aware, there is a statement to follow our proceedings on the Bill. I turn to new clause 85, which would change the lost payments regime under the Land Compensation Act 1973. To be clear, lost payments are an amount of compensation paid to eligible claimants to reflect and recognise the inconvenience and disruption caused by CPOs. They are an additional payment to compensation claimable under the Land Compensation Act 1961 for the market value of land or property taken by compulsory purchase. The new clause would allow claimants to claim compensation for the market value of their interests twice, and result in over-compensation being paid. That would be disproportionate. It would also run counter to the established, overriding principle of equivalence in compensation law where a person subject to compulsory purchase should be left no better or worse off in financial terms after an acquisition than they were before. On that basis, we cannot accept the new clause. I will touch briefly on new clause 42 in the name of the other shadow Minister, the hon. Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (David Simmonds), regarding loss payments. It would introduce a change to the  loss payment compensation regime under the Land Compensation Act 1973, increasing the amount that occupiers of buildings or land subject to a CPO would be entitled to and placing them on an equal footing with owners. As we discussed at some length in Committee, the Bill already achieves in part what the hon. Gentleman is seeking in the new clause as it increases the loss payment compensation due to occupiers of buildings and land. The purpose of loss payments is to reflect the inconvenience caused by compulsory purchase. It is occupiers, rather than investor-owners, who bear the greater burden in that respect: they are the ones who will need to close or relocate their businesses. Loss payments are a separate head of claim from compensation paid for land taken under compulsory purchase. The Bill rebalances loss payment compensation to allow occupiers to claim a higher amount and landowners to claim a lower amount. We believe that the rebalancing of loss payment compensation in favour of occupiers is the right approach and will benefit, for example, groups  such as tenant farmers, for which Opposition Members have made a case in this afternoon's debate. On that basis, I am afraid that we cannot accept the amendment and I request that the hon. Member does not press it. Lastly, the hon. Member for Henley and Thame (Freddie van Mierlo) made a case for greater support for active travel schemes that are to be considered in the public interest for the purposes of CPO. We are extremely keen to support local authorities to use their CPO powers in the public interest and have already published guidance on the compulsory purchase process, including advice on how local authorities can demonstrate the compelling case, in the public interest, for use of their CPO powers. We will also publish updated guidance to reflect the reforms being implemented through the Bill. In addition, CPO powers can already be used, as the hon. Gentleman made clear, for active travel routes and can be executed by local authorities as part of their wider statutory functions. To assist authorities in deploying those powers more effectively, Active Travel England, which as he knows is an executive agency sponsored by the Department for Transport, is developing guidance to support local authorities in the design and delivery of active travel routes. That will be published in consultation with local authorities in due course. Even though the hon. Member for Henley and Thame seemed to suggest that he knew the content of that publication, let us examine the details in due course when it is brought forward and published. Given that the guidance on the CPO process already exists and, as I have said, further guidance is set to be published by Active Travel England, I believe the amendment is unnecessary and I cannot accept it. To conclude, the amendments proposed today are, in the Government's view, either unnecessary or detrimental to the objectives of the Bill. More widely, on other parts of the Bill and areas on which we have received fair challenge, we will of course continue to reflect on whether the legislation can be further strengthened and improved. When it comes to development corporations and compulsory purchase order reforms, we think that the Bill, as amended in Committee, is robust and effective. On that basis, I hope the whole House can get behind the Bill this afternoon. Question put, That the clause be read a Second time."
"Madam Speaker, this new government is focused on rolling out the most ambitious affordable housing plan that Canada has ever seen. We expect the members opposite to support this. They have raised many questions on this issue. Clearly, they are keen to support our initiatives to scale up affordable housing across Canada with the “build Canada homes” initiative. We look forward to that support. It is time to build."
"That could be the case as well. Madam Speaker, I am not sure the new government is really fooling anyone, even its own members. It has the same ministers talking about the same thing. Instead of coming to Canadians with a plan to actually deal with the mess that they themselves created, they have brought half measures, or crumbs. That seems to be the Liberal way, which is that the Liberals are going to overtax and over-regulate, and then give a little back and ask people to say thanks for it. That is not sufficient. In fact, that is why we proposed, in our platform, and again, I encourage the Liberals to take the whole thing, not just half of it, to get rid of not just the consumer carbon tax but also the industrial carbon tax. It defies any understanding of basic economics to suggest that we can keep the industrial carbon tax, but that would not translate down into pricing that consumers pay. It is basic economics. If a producer has to pay more to produce their product, whether that is getting food to the table, refining gasoline or building concrete to build homes, and as members probably know, producing concrete is a large emitter of CO2, so they are going to pay a lot, that is going to directly translate into the costs of building and homes. The Liberals suggest that we can eliminate the carbon tax and that everything will be fine. By the way, it is astounding that, for 10 years, I was told that I was a bad person, or that I did not believe in science, if I did not believe that a carbon tax would change the weather. Now the Liberals seem to say, “What carbon tax? That was not our carbon tax. What are you talking about?” It is gone, and they are sorry they did a bad PR job, even though, in their view, it was good policy. They did a bad PR job, so they have to cut it, but they will keep the industrial carbon tax and hope that Canadians do not understand the difference and do not understand some basic economics. Canadians will understand it because most Canadians have to budget. When they do their budget, they go through their lines and they figure out their costs, including what it is going to cost this year, how much income they are going to make, what their expenses are, and whether their income is going to be satisfactory for their expenses or if they will have to cut down. Canadians understand those concepts. I am not sure why the government does not. There is no budget. There is no plan. The parliamentary secretary and anyone else who wants to discuss this bill needs to bring us a budget to talk about affordability, not half measures that do not go the full way. On this new government, which really is not new, it is just the same members and the same ministers, it is almost a little bit worse. The new Prime Minister seems to be pretty close and pretty friendly with the guy south of the border. That is interesting. At least with Mr. Trudeau, we saw there was really no love lost between him and the president. I am not sure that is the case here with the current Prime Minister. The reason I say that is that we often hear that the finest form of flattery is imitation, and we have seen our Prime Minister imitating Mr. Trump's actions, whether it was his first action to eliminate the consumer carbon tax, which was signing a document. To this day, I am not sure what that document was. As any first-year law student will know, the Prime Minister does not have the authority to pass law. Was he signing this to flatter the President? Was he signing it to imitate the President? I am not sure, but he continues to do that. The Prime Minister called him a “transformational” President. That is pretty high praise from a Canadian Prime Minister. We are often accused of being like the President, but it seems that the only one who is acting like him, following him and taking his lead is the Prime Minister. Like many members, I knocked on many doors throughout my campaign, and of course, housing and the cost of living were top issues. I am from a northern GTA riding, the last GTA riding in York Region and Durham Region, and housing is pretty expensive in my area of the country. Having a GST cut that is only for houses that are $1 million to $1.5 million would not really do enough in my area because many homes are greater than $1 million and, in fact, greater than $1.5 million. More than that, this proposal is only for new homebuyers; it is not for new homes. Let us not forget that there is a difference here. That is why I said that if the Liberals are going to steal our idea, they should steal the whole thing. It is not just me saying this; the industry has said it too. Bild, the industry association, has said that this proposal would affect only a small number of homebuyers. In fact, I believe it said that it would not substantially improve affordability. If the act is about affordability, but industry is telling us that this proposal would not do anything about that, then what is the point of it? If the Liberals are going to bring forward a proposal to affect affordability, it should at least achieve the objective they have set out for themselves. By their own measure, they are failing at that. I would suggest that they go back to our platform and read it. I know they were reading it because that is clear. Maybe they could propose an amendment, or we could, to fix it for them and bring it in line with our platform. I know members are keen to learn what we have to say because we have good ideas. It is there; let us bring it in. I will also say that many homebuyers are not necessarily first-time homebuyers. Many people start in a condo or a smaller home when they are first married before they have children, and when they move into another stage of life that needs a bigger home with more bedrooms, perhaps for more children, they buy another home. Those people are not first-time homebuyers, but they are still new homebuyers in the sense that they are moving their way up the property ladder. This proposal would not do anything for them because they would not technically be first-time homebuyers. The bill does not go far enough. We are open to what the government has to propose when it is taken from good ideas that are ours. I would encourage the Liberal government to go back and look at those proposals, maybe amend the bill and bring it back. Then maybe we can have a debate on whether it is acceptable. As to the carbon tax, I want to raise an important issue that was brought to my attention during the election. I have two great first nations in my riding. One of them is the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation. It is located on an island in the middle of Lake Simcoe, which is accessible only by ferry. When the carbon tax was implemented, the cost of diesel fuel to run that ferry increased. Even if someone believes that a carbon tax would change the weather, they have to believe that there is elasticity of supply, that if they cannot use one fuel, they can use something else to substitute it. Well, when someone runs a ferry, they cannot do that because it runs on diesel, and it is the only way to get to the first nation. I would like the members opposite to comment on that. Perhaps, in reviewing this bill, and maybe we can propose some amendments to it, they will consider refunding communities like the Chippewas of Georgina Island, which have no alternatives and can only purchase diesel fuel. I think that would really help affordability for first nations."
"Mr. Speaker, I think of the comments being made from across the way, and in particular by the member for Algonquin—Renfrew—Pembroke . If we were to read the speech she delivered and her answers to questions, we would think that gas will stop selling in Canada shortly. We would think that Russia and other influences are going to prevent all gas vehicles from being sold in Canada virtually immediately. There are Conservatives who put a hard-right spin of misinformation in order to generate funds through their email network, and I know they have a massive one, to spread misinformation. There are a lot of good things happening today, even with the threat of Donald Trump, the tariffs and trade. Whether it is union workers or the industry as a whole, different levels of government, in some cases municipal but always federal and provincial stakeholders, are there to protect the industry and to ensure that the jobs of the future are in fact being taken into consideration and that investments in one form or another are being delivered. That is how we are going to ensure that we continue to grow with a greener economy and beyond."
"If Iran chooses to close the straits of Hormuz, which the Iranian Parliament has now voted to do, what contingency options has the Foreign Secretary worked up to protect UK national interests?"
"Madam Speaker, we know that those in the lower tax brackets with the lowest incomes are the ones most disproportionately affected by affordability problems. This will give meaningful financial relief to people in the lowest income brackets to help them make ends meet. This is how we are going to continue to improve the lives of Canadians, particularly those who are struggling most."
"Mr. Speaker, the Liberals seem to want to pick up where the Conservatives left off and abandon the fight against climate change. Their EV incentive program was discontinued well before the deadline, causing challenges for dealers who wanted to meet the zero-emission vehicle standard. Some dealers advanced as much as $11 million to pay for federal subsidies, but they did not receive the expected payments. Dealers in Quebec alone accounted for approximately $9 million of that amount. The Minister of Industry announced that the government would resume the EV incentive program, but nothing is happening. I would like to know what my colleague thinks about this."
"We are all concerned about the rise in food poverty in recent years. It is a blight on our country and communities, and we want to put it right. This Government are committed to eradicating child poverty. That is why we have the child poverty taskforce, and we are looking at a range of measures. Just a couple of weeks ago, we introduced an extension of free school meals to all those in receipt of universal credit. That will transform the food poverty issues for young people across our country that my hon. Friend describes."
"Appearances do not lie. A Liberal is a Liberal is a scandal. The Auditor General issued a scathing report this morning on GC Strategies and the Liberal ArriveCAN app. That two-person company received $64 million in payments from the Liberals. The Auditor General found that nobody knows who did the work, what was done, whether the people who did something were qualified or whether they had the necessary security clearances. The ministers who allowed that to happen all got promotions. When will the Liberal Prime Minister recover the money that his government took out of the pockets of all Canadians?"
"as Mr. Goldman mentioned, I represent Boulder, Colorado, in the Congress. I live in Boulder County. My wife and I are incredibly blessed and lucky to be raising our family in this community. Last week, I introduced a bipartisan resolution denouncing this heinous anti-Semitic terror attack in my community. H. Res. 476, a resolution that makes clear that we stand with the Jewish people, the Jewish community, and which explicitly calls for us to do more to address the scourge of anti-Semitism. Mr. Speaker, that resolution is broadly supported by the members of Colorado's congressional delegation. Colorado has eight Federal lawmakers here in Washington. Six of the eight joined that resolution. I thank Republican Representatives Jeff Crank and Jeff Hurd for doing the right thing and joining that resolution so that we could speak in one voice in denouncing this attack. There were two Members of Colorado's entire congressional delegation who refused to join this resolution. One of them, Mr. Gabe Evans of Colorado, instead decided to introduce the resolution that the House is going to consider today. This resolution is not bipartisan. It is not carried by the Member who represents this community. This a first, by the way, Mr. Speaker, in the precedence of this House, that the majority would not give the Representative who represents the victims the opportunity to speak on behalf of their community, but Mr. Evans decided to proceed anyway. Mr. Speaker, of course, because Mr. Evans does not represent this community, the resolution that he has introduced is riddled with inaccuracies. That is not a surprise. It is why it is important for Members who represent communities that are besieged by tragedies like this one to have the opportunity to introduce a resolution and have that resolution considered on the floor. Let me give you some examples, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Evans' resolution claims that there were 14 victims of this attack. He is wrong. There are 15 victims. Maybe he got that from Google or found it in a newspaper article, but had he been involved in the conversations with law enforcement, as I have, he would know that there were 15 victims of this terrible attack. It is poor decorum to ask this body to vote on a resolution that lists the wrong number of victims. They are my constituents. They are real people who were burned half to death by a terrorist 7 days ago. The least you can do is list the right number. Mr. Evans' resolution also says that ``reportedly one victim was a Holocaust survivor.'' She is not reportedly a survivor. She is a Holocaust survivor. There is no doubt to that. There is no allegation to that. I know because she is my constituent. The word ``reportedly'' should be struck from this resolution. My colleague's resolution, Mr. Speaker--Mr. Evans' resolution, to be clear, because we are considering multiple resolutions today, so I am talking about the resolution from Mr. Gabe Evans of Colorado--does not mention once, not once, the Boulder Police Department, the officers who I represent who put their lives on the line to save members of the community 7 days ago. The resolution that Mr. Evans has offered doesn't mention the FBI once, not once, whose swift response was so integral. The only law enforcement agency that Mr. Evans mentions is ICE, the one agency that was not in Boulder that day. We should have the decency to recognize the Boulder Police Department and the officers who I represent who put their lives on the line 7 days ago. It is the least we can do. We have a resolution that does that in a bipartisan way. Had the House majority, the Republicans, done what Republicans and Democrats in this Chamber have done since time immemorial, since I have served in this body, which is allow a Member to put his resolution to the floor for a vote, mistakes like this wouldn't happen. Now, I know that an earlier version of this resolution that Mr. Evans introduced, which he tweeted about, talked about the fact that this was because Colorado was a sanctuary State. He has removed that language from this resolution, so I am heartened that he now concedes that is an inaccurate claim, that that language is not in this resolution. However, in times like these, I would have hoped that my colleagues would be willing to come together to properly honor the victims and to condemn anti-Semitism, as I have said, as our resolution does. It is not hard to do the right thing, Mr. Speaker. The question that Mr. Evans should answer is: Why? Why not join his two other Republican colleagues in Colorado and join the bipartisan resolution that thanks the Boulder Police Department, that thanks the FBI?  The purpose of these resolutions is to unite the Congress, not divide it. The purpose is to unite us in condemning violent attacks like these, to make clear that we stand with the Jewish community today and always and that we will be there for them in the weeks and months ahead. Mr. Speaker, I encourage you, read the resolution that Mr. Evans introduced. You will not find a single reference--not one--to the victims' families, the people I met with over the weekend, the people I marched with. There is nothing in Mr. Evans' resolution about standing with the Jewish people. Nothing. The word ``Jewish'' is mentioned once in this resolution. The terrorist's name is mentioned 13 times. There is no mention of this being a hate crime. There is nothing in the resolution about the anti-Semitism that is metastasizing across the country that Mr. Van Drew and I agree is a scourge. So much of what Mr. Van Drew said is in the bipartisan resolution that I introduced. None of it is in the one that Mr. Evans introduced. There is not one mention, Mr. Speaker, in his resolution of Run for Their Lives, the organization that was targeted by this terrorist, the organization that has been pushing for the release of the hostages. They couldn't include one reference to the organization that was targeted? One? I have served in this body, as I mentioned previously, Mr. Speaker, for 6\1/2\ years, and I have seen a lot of partisan debate unfold on this floor, but I think it is disgraceful to not give my community an opportunity to see our resolution considered on this floor. I don't know how the Republican majority can force a vote on a resolution like this that gets so many of the basic facts wrong. I had hoped that my Republican colleagues would choose a different course, but they have yet to do so. There is still time.  The Speaker, the majority leader could put our bipartisan resolution on the floor for a vote. They could fix the defects in the resolution that Mr. Evans has introduced. I would implore them to do so."
I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.
"It is common ridings and festival season in the Scottish Borders, a spectacular and ancient tradition dating back to the battle of Flodden in 1513, bringing together each of the Borders communities to celebrate, so may we have a debate on the importance of the Scottish Borders common ridings and festivals? Will the Leader of the House join me in congratulating Selkirk's Royal Burgh standard bearer, Darren Knox, and to wish him very well for this week's Selkirk common riding?"
"Mr. Chair, the department funds provinces, territories and local governments to help them in the process of building. The government is not directly building, but we should be in the business of that going forward to make sure affordable housing is getting built."
"I thank our acting ranking member for his leadership here and to honor our incredible ranking member. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill, which of course, supports our fight against cancer and to improve healthcare for all Federal workers. This is such an important way to honor the legacy of our colleague, our Ranking Member Gerry Connolly. Gerry was a dedicated public servant, a fighter, and a mentor to all of us on the Oversight Committee. Gerry worked to hold our government accountable for over 30 years and was dedicated to improving the lives of all Americans. He was a champion of our Federal workforce, of transparency, and in making government work for all the people that we serve. He believed in the power of Congress and in fighting tirelessly for the constituents that he served and, of course, for the rule of law and our Constitution. He served as a county executive where he fought to expand affordable housing and to invest in infrastructure, and he always supported public workers. He delivered for his community. He delivered for the country, and he left a proud legacy. Now, Gerry represented the best among us in public service, which is why we strongly support this bill. We all miss him greatly, and I know every single member of our committee will work to carry on his legacy.  Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to honor Gerry by supporting this bill."

"I thank my hon. and gallant Friend, who served for a long time in the RAF, as well as in the United Nations. These issues are desperate. As he knows, we have taken actions against Israeli settlers and extremists, and we have been clear that if the Israeli Government do not change course, there will be further measures, including targeted sanctions."
"Mr. Speaker, as a CPA who has dealt with a lot of taxes for the last 26 years, I have witnessed many occasions when the government makes a big announcement, just like a lot of these ones here. They make a lot of hay out of how much it will change things, but in the end, it really makes little difference. On the GST, if the Liberals actually have some stats on how many people are new homebuyers who are buying a brand new home, I am sure they would find that it is very few. The effect they are touting is not going to be very effective."
"I congratulate the hon. Member for Edinburgh West (Christine Jardine) on securing this debate. I am grateful for her speech, and agree that the people we are talking about keep us safe and well, and show true dedication to public service. I absolutely understand the point that she is making. I will talk a little bit about the background to McCloud, before talking about the progress that has been made to date and what further steps the scheme managers still need to take, as the hon. Lady outlined. The McCloud remedy is, by its nature, a complex undertaking, as I am sure she will appreciate. It applies to 20 public service pension schemes in the UK, and the scheme managers for those schemes are responsible for ensuring that the remedy is administered properly and in accordance with their statutory provisions. This issue, as the hon. Lady said, arises out of the introduction of new pension schemes for public sector workers in 2014-15. When introducing those pension schemes, the Government at the time gave what is called a transitional protection to older workers, but as she set out, in 2018 the Court of Appeal found that those protections gave rise to unlawful discrimination on the grounds of age, race and sex. In 2019, the Government announced that they would address that discrimination through the McCloud remedy. There are two main elements to the remedy. The ongoing difference in treatment between older and younger workers was removed by closing the older pre-2015 pension schemes and moving all active members into the new pension schemes in relation to employment after 31 March 2022. However, addressing the discrimination that occurred between 2014 and 2022 is considerably more complex, as hon. Members will appreciate, because whether individual members are better off under the older legacy schemes or newer reform schemes will depend on their individual employment histories and circumstances, and in some cases will not be certain until they retire. The remedy therefore gives a choice over legacy or reform scheme benefits, which is given at the point of retirement for active and deferred members, and is in the process of being rolled out for members who have already retired. Delivering the remedy to more than 3 million affected scheme members is also an intensive administrative challenge. There are many different elements to it, but the most crucial is that all those affected must be provided with individualised information about their pension entitlements during the 2015 to 2022 remedy period, through what is known as a remediable service statement or RSS. In addition, a smaller group of members, whose tax position during the remedy period may have changed, need to be provided with a remediable pension savings statement--an RPSS. Given the complexity of the McCloud remedy, schemes are also providing significant levels of guidance and online resources to help members understand the information they receive and the decision they need to make. That information is often very complex, as hon. Members know because many have been in the position of receiving it. There is also a dedicated HMRC digital service to allow members receiving an RPSS to understand their tax position. There are processes in place to allow members to pay additional tax or, as will be the case for the majority of members, to claim either a tax refund or compensation from the scheme where a refund is not possible. Providing these statements to members, together with the other aspects of implementing the remedy, is the responsibility, as the hon. Lady will know, of pension scheme managers. For the largest public service schemes, including the NHS scheme in England and Wales, the teachers' scheme in England and Wales, and the civil service scheme across the UK, the scheme manager is the relevant Secretary of State. The local government, police and fire schemes are administered locally, which means each responsible authority, force or brigade has its own scheme manager, who is responsible for the operation of the scheme in that area. The devolved Administrations--this is pertinent to the concerns raised by the hon. Lady, the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) and my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline and Dollar (Graeme Downie)--have responsibility for administering their schemes. The Scottish Government, through the Scottish Public Pensions Agency, have responsibility for the police, fire, NHS and teachers' schemes in Scotland. The Welsh Government are responsible for the firefighters' scheme in Wales. Pension schemes in Northern Ireland are established under a separate legal framework and are the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Government. This means that the picture on implementing the remedy across the different schemes is complex and may be subject to particular factors that affect one scheme but not necessarily another. The remedy itself varies across the schemes, reflecting the fact that the schemes themselves are specific to each workforce and have different benefit designs. This can be seen in the differing levels of progress that schemes have so far made. I am aware that across the police scheme in England and Wales, around 90% of the total number of RSSs have so far been issued, and I understand that the picture is similar in the police scheme in Scotland, with 97% of deferred choice and over three quarters of immediate choice RSSs already issued. Although that is not yet matched by other schemes, significant progress is being made elsewhere. For example, the civil service scheme in England and Wales has issued around 45% of immediate choice RSSs and the teachers' scheme around 47%. It was always anticipated that providing RSSs to members would be challenging, and that is specifically recognised in the legislation governing the remedy. In particular, the Public Service Pensions and Judicial  Offices Act 2022 sets out that for the provision of RSSs, there is a deadline of 31 March 2025, or--here comes the qualification-- ""such later day as the scheme manager considers reasonable in all the circumstances in the case of a particular member or a particular class of member"". Given that I was asked about delays, I think it is worth reflecting that hon. Members have raised concerns about their constituents who are experiencing delays in receiving the remedy. I am standing in for the Pensions Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea West (Torsten Bell), but I used to be the Pensions Minister myself, so I have some knowledge of the issue, and I encourage scheme managers to take every step possible to resolve those cases as quickly as possible and to prioritise cases where individuals may be in particular need. The hon. Member for Edinburgh West reflected on a number of such cases in her excellent contribution. I assure anybody in this position that where there is an uplift in interest on pension payments, interest will be paid on arrears, so they will not lose out financially as a result of the delays, but I do understand that the delays are frustrating. As the hon. Lady will be aware, the overarching principle of the McCloud remedy is to put people back in the situation they would have been in if the discrimination had not occurred. In order to do that, it is necessary to apply interest where payments should have been made at an earlier date, whether by the scheme or the member. In this debate, we have heard more about the delays of the scheme towards the member. Interest is applied at 8% when the scheme owes money to the member. Where the member owes money to the scheme, interest is applied at the NS&I direct saver rate, which is currently 3.5%. I hope that reassures the hon. Lady to a certain extent. We think it is right that these decisions are made by scheme managers, as they are the only ones with full possession of all the relevant information. As I have said, with that information and the variety of different factors, the situation is complex. Having said that, the Government are committed to ensuring that all affected members are provided with the remedy they deserve as quickly as possible, including ensuring that members already in receipt of pension benefits or approaching their retirement are prioritised. Where scheme managers have exercised their statutory discretion to extend the deadline for providing some members with an RSS, it is therefore important that appropriate new deadlines are set out and that robust plans are in place to ensure the new deadlines are met. Scheme managers must ensure that the plans are properly communicated to pension scheme members to provide them with certainty. The Pensions Regulator must also be kept informed of plans and progress, and I know that schemes have been having these discussions with the regulator. Similarly, there have been delays in other aspects of the remedy, such as the provision of the RPSSs to those who need them. As I set out earlier, that affects a smaller number of people. However, it is difficult for those people if they are kept waiting. It is important that schemes keep members informed and provide them with appropriate resources and support. Although I am pleased to say that the process of sending out RPSSs in England and Wales is 90% complete and that some  schemes have sent them to all affected members, I know that there are issues in other parts of the country. As I said, this is a very complex area. If I have not answered all of the hon. Lady's questions, I am happy to write to her. Given the importance of delivering the McCloud remedy effectively, the Pensions Minister has recently written to responsible Departments, requesting details of their plans to issue remaining RSSs and RPSSs to all affected members. All those affected by the McCloud remedy can be assured that a robust and complete statutory remedy has been put in place and that schemes  are working to ensure that members receive the information and support they need. I do, though, note the points that the hon. Lady has made about the impact of the delays on her constituents. They will have the opportunity to decide whether to receive legacy or reform scheme benefits in relation to their service. I again thank the hon. Lady for bringing this matter to the House. Question put and agreed to. House adjourned."
"I do apologise to Mr Speaker regularly, I have to say--usually in private, but I am happy to extend that apology to him today if he has not heard me apologise. I have the utmost respect for Mr Speaker, who I work very closely with, and I totally respect his job in upholding Back Benchers' rights to question and scrutinise Ministers and Government policy. That is what he is there to do, and he does it brilliantly. I do not know what Privy Council briefings were offered to whom, but I can inquire for the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith), and I will make sure that he gets a reply."
"Mr. Chair, Canadians not being treated well when they travel and not having access to quick results when there are problems is, obviously, unacceptable to me. I would hope it is unacceptable to everyone in this House."
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague on her speech. However, what I do not understand is the Liberals' old habit of hiding behind lawyers and procedures instead of making a firm political commitment to stand up for taxpayers who have been wronged and robbed of their money. Why is the member unable to stand up today and clearly tell Canadians and Quebeckers that the government will do everything it can to recover the money they lost because of GC Strategies?"
"moved: That Vote 1, in the amount of $6,363,904,082, under Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation — Repayments to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, in the Main Estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026, be concurred in."
"Unfortunately, I have another quote, which is from yesterday. With regard to the Opposition's amendments, can the shadow Minister point to a single measure that would increase the number of homes? All the changes directed at the Bill seem to be designed to impede development. I also want to ask him what he meant yesterday in his opening remarks, when he said, ""The last Government built the largest number of houses in history.""--[Official Report, 9 June 2025; Vol"
"Mr. Speaker, it is a tremendous honour to rise again in the House as the member of Parliament for Markham—Stouffville. I am thankful to my wonderful campaign team and to the people of Markham—Stouffville for the privilege of serving them. Markham—Stouffville is an extraordinary place due to the contributions of countless exceptional individuals, whom I recognized earlier this year with the King's coronation medals. Congratulations to Mark Atikian, Allan Bell, Lina Bigioni, Shaowen Chen, Mike Clare, Glenn Crosby, Wayne Emmerson, Margaret Grandison, Ray McNeice, Jack Heath, Sivan Ilangko, Dr. Fareen Karachiwalla, Dr. Emilie Lam, Madge Logan, Mayor Iain Lovatt, Jo-anne Marr, Rev. Joan Masterton, Haresh Mehta, Ignacio “Mogi” Mogado, Marlene Mogado, Dr. Najmul Siddiqui, Chief Bill Snowball, Susan Tucker, Dr. Rui Wang, John Webster, Tupper Wheatley. Congratulations to them all."
"I welcome the hon. Lady's suggestion, and I would welcome more resources going into local planning teams, but what we have here is a problem,  which she may well encounter in her own constituency. Hon. Members should be very careful indeed when developers promise X, Y and Z affordable, social and accessible homes, even with legally binding section 106 agreements, because those agreements can be changed at whim when a local planning authority is put under pressure."
"Mr. Speaker, we agree to apply the vote, with the Conservatives voting in favour."
"Mr. Speaker, Bill C-2 would give unprecedented powers, without judicial review or a warrant, to the RCMP or CSIS to access information or demand information from any service provider in the country. It does not matter if it is someone's doctor, dentist, landlord, bank or psychiatrist. It does not matter who it is. They can demand information about when someone went to see them and for how long they have seen them. This has nothing to do with border security. How could the member possibly defend this violation of Canadians' privacy?"
"Mr. Speaker, homelessness is a huge challenge right across the country. We face a huge challenge in tackling it with affordable housing. We need to be working with the cities, towns and indigenous communities to make sure we are delivering. There is a reason we have a new government here, with a new cabinet, that is focused on building Canada and focused first and foremost on building affordable housing for the people who need it the most."
"My hon. Friend knows that I believe the workers at that mill in her constituency are a national asset and that I want them to have a strong future as part of our overall steel strategy. We are closely monitoring the specific situation there, which colleagues will be aware of, and are determined to find the outcome that she and I would want to see."
"I will be brief, given the time limit that has been set. I must say I was slightly disappointed that there were not more musical numbers and puns from the Minister in his speech at the start--I am sure we will get some later. I am really proud to represent Harrogate and Knaresborough. At the moment, Knaresborough High Street is adorned with flags celebrating Pride, and I know that our towns are incredibly tolerant and open places. Earlier this year, we had a particular incident with a candidate from the Conservatives standing in the local elections who posted really quite grim and disgusting tweets. I am really pleased that our towns rejected that at the ballot box. Harrogate used to have a Pride parade, but it stopped when the pandemic came along. I really hope that me and the Harrogate Pride organisation can get that up and running in due course."
"Too many of my constituents feel they are being left to fend for themselves on unsafe roads. They are scared for their children, they are tired of reporting the same danger again and again, and they are angry that nothing changes until someone is seriously hurt, or worse. My message to the Government today is simple: people should not have to die or be seriously injured before something is done about dangerous speeding. Provisional estimates for 2024 suggest that 1,633 people were killed on Britain's roads last year, while 56% of fatal road collisions in 2023 involved one or more speed-related factors. I have three clear asks of the Minister today. First, the Government must move to taking a proactive approach to fixed speed camera placement, rather than waiting for a tragedy before allowing action. Secondly, I am asking that national guidance--specifically, Department for Transport circular 01/2007, ""Use of speed and red-light cameras for traffic enforcement: Guidance on deployment, visibility and signing--be updated to reflect this proactive approach. Thirdly, I want the Government to make it easier for local communities, who know their roads better than anyone, to get the speed cameras they need without having to fight for years to be heard, if the data can back up the request."
"Mr. Speaker, we will present the members opposite an opportunity to build. We will present the one Canadian economy bill. We will rapidly advance projects of national interest and build one economy, not 13. The bill will grow the economy and make Canada the strongest economy in the G7. We hope they will join us in voting for it."
"Even celebrities such as Emma Raducanu, and others in the public eye who have been affected by stalkers, feel unsafe and unprotected by existing legislation. Does the hon. Member agree that is clear additional evidence that the law needs strengthening?"
"With permission, I shall update the House on the Government's work to boost growth across the United Kingdom. As the Prime Minister set out in the plan for change, economic growth is the No. 1 mission of this Government. It is key to achieving the Government's goals: higher wages for working people; delivering economic and national security; and investing in our public services. We are already making progress. The most recent figures show that the United Kingdom was the fastest growing economy of any G7 country in the first quarter of the year and that real wages have risen more since July 2024 than over the first 10 years of the previous Conservative Government. But we are keenly aware that this progress must be widely felt in every part of the country. As such, our plan for regional growth will be hardwired into the spending review and infrastructure strategy, which will be set out in more detail in the coming weeks. This investment will be targeted squarely at the renewal of Britain and fixed on the priorities of working people, delivering on the promise of change and improving lives and communities across the country. This morning, the Chancellor set out her next steps for nationwide growth in a series of speeches across the north and the midlands, and I am pleased to update the House on those announcements now. A key part of the Government's growth mission is the view that growth relies on dynamic, interconnected city regions, creating clusters of activity where people can get around, communicate, share ideas, commute, find good work, and earn wages that flow back into strong local economies. As most Members know, the majority of our city regions have poor public transport systems, holding back growth and improvements to air quality and making it harder to get around. Stronger transport links are therefore crucial. They create opportunities for individuals to access a wider pool of jobs, for employers to access a wider labour market, and for businesses to expand the market for their goods and services. If we were to increase the productivity of our largest city regions outside London just to match the national average, it would grow the economy by PS86 billion. So I am pleased to say that this Government are making the biggest investment in intra-city transport connectivity that this country has ever seen. The spending review will allocate funding for ambitious local transport programmes across England, including the new transport for city regions fund launched by the Government today. This will give nine city region mayors a share of PS15.6 billion in long-term transport for city region settlements running until 2032. The benefits and opportunities will be felt in the cities and towns across these combined authorities and by those who commute to work from outside those city regions. The previous Government said that they would do some of this but, as was always the case, they never put the money aside to pay for it. As a result of our reforms to the fiscal rules and decisions to increase investment in the 2024 autumn Budget, this Labour Government are delivering. The funding announced today will mean that the Mayor of West Yorkshire can now fully commit to delivering the West Yorkshire mass transit system, which  will be fully integrated with cycling, walking, bus and rail, making journeys quicker, more accessible and more reliable across the region. The Mayor of the West Midlands can extend the metro from Birmingham city centre to the new sports quarter, unlocking more than PS3 billion of private investment, and bringing benefits and opportunities to those living in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood) and all who travel there. It will mean that the Mayor of Greater Manchester can grow and transform the Metrolink tram network, building new tram stocks in Bury, Manchester and Oldham, which will help drive up living standards for the constituents of my hon. Friends the Members for Bury North (Mr Frith), for Bury South (Christian Wakeford) and for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Debbie Abrahams), and for others in the north-west region. The Mayor of the Liverpool city region can deliver three new rapid bus routes linking up the city centre, John Lennon airport, the new Everton stadium on Bramley-Moore dock, and new homes built on the Central Docks redevelopment and Anfield. The Mayor of the North East will now be able to extend the Tyne and Wear Metro, linking Washington with Newcastle and Sunderland, connecting those living in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Washington and Gateshead South (Mrs Hodgson) to new jobs and opportunities. I pay particular tribute to my hon. Friend, who has campaigned for this project for years and years, and it is now being delivered by a Labour Government. This investment will also mean that the Mayor of South Yorkshire can renew the existing and now publicly owned Supertram network with track replacements, overhead line maintenance, and rolling stock renewal, yielding a fleet of new vehicles by 2032, linking jobs and homes in Sheffield and the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion). We are backing the Mayor of the West of England's plans for mass transit development across the region, with improved rail infrastructure to help unlock more services between Brabazon and Bristol city centre, meaning shorter journey times to Bristol Temple Meads across the wider area and providing greater opportunities for those in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Filton and Bradley Stoke (Claire Hazelgrove) and--declaring my own interest--in my own. After years of the Mayor of Tees Valley trying to persuade his Conservative colleagues to fund these important projects, I am delighted to confirm today that this Labour Government are now backing the region to invest in, for example, the Middlesborough station in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough and Thornaby East (Andy McDonald), unblocking local networks and increasing capacity on local lines. I pay particular thanks to my hon. Friends the Members in the Teesside region who have lobbied hard to see this investment in their region--now being delivered by a Labour Government. The Mayor of the East Midlands can now forge the Trent Arc, linking Derby and Nottingham to create tens of thousands of new jobs and homes, connecting Infinity Park investment zone and the east midlands freeport with sites including Ratcliffe-on-Soar clean energy and advanced manufacturing and east midlands intermodal park--home of Toyota in the region--along the Trent Arc corridor. This funding is substantial, marking a 2.4 times real-terms increase in spending on city region connectivity, funding the priorities that matter to hard-working people across the country. These announcements were only made possible today because at the autumn Budget 2024 the Chancellor took the necessary action to reform the fiscal rules to improve stability after years of chaos from the Conservative party, and to unlock investment. This means the Government can now provide greater investment in Britain's economic revival as, for the first time, the Treasury takes account of the value of financial assets and not just the costs of investment. That has enabled us to increase investment by over PS113 billion more than the previous Conservative Government, while keeping debt on a sustainable path--only made possible by the credibility of our fiscal rules, which require day-to-day spending to be funded with revenue. It is more important than ever to have a robust fiscal framework. I am pleased to note that the Office for Budget Responsibility confirmed at the spring statement that the Government will meet their stability and investment rules two years ahead of schedule. In addition to her announcements today regarding transport for city region settlements, the Chancellor will set out further detail on this allocation of additional funding at next week's spending review. In January, the Chancellor announced a review of the Green Book, the Government guidance on appraising options for investment. Since then, we have consulted extensively with stakeholders from across the country, considering potential problems with the Green Book guidance itself and how the guidance is being applied in practice. I thank and pay tribute to many hon. Members across the House for engaging on this important issue. We will publish the full conclusions of the review next week. It will mark a new approach to Government decision making that puts an end to siloed Whitehall thinking and takes account of the reinforcing economic effects of infrastructure, housing, skills and jobs to ensure that investment takes place in every part of the country. These announcements reflect just a fraction of our plans to supercharge growth across the United Kingdom. We are focused on investing across all parts of the country to boost prosperity and deliver the change the British people voted for at last year's election, and there is more to come. The spending review, which we will publish next week, will set out in further detail how an active Government will continue to deliver growth, empowering all regions and nations of the UK to reach their full potential and making working people across the country better off, no matter where they choose to live and work. Unlike the Conservatives, who will tell us that they would have delivered on their false promises after 14 years of failing to do so, this Labour Government, in our first year in office, are delivering: a country that people will see is being set up for success that they can take part in. That is the change we promised, and that is the change this Labour Government are delivering. I commend this statement to the House."
When she plans to bring forward legislative proposals to ban conversion therapy
"Mr. Speaker, the Liberals and the Conservatives all voted to make Quebeckers pay $814 million in bogus Canada carbon rebate cheques. The Parliamentary Budget Officer confirmed it, saying that the funds will obviously be drawn from the consolidated revenue fund. Worse still, Quebeckers are going to keep paying. The Parliamentary Budget Officer also said that there was no doubt that there would be interest to pay on that amount because, in a deficit situation, every additional expenditure results in additional borrowing. Why are the Liberals and Conservatives stealing from Quebeckers?"
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shine a light on a team that holds a special place in my riding of Hamilton Centre, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. Formed in 1869, the Tiger-Cats is one of North America's oldest sports teams, bringing home 15 Grey Cup championships and countless memories for Hamiltonians. Born in the shadows of Hamilton's two steel giants, Dofasco and Stelco, the Tiger-Cats have battled on the same turf for nearly a century, on a field that echoes with the pride of Hamilton's working class. More than a football team, the Tiger-Cats embody the toughness and resilience that define our city. This Saturday, June 14, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats kick off their season against the Saskatchewan Roughriders. I wish them a fantastic season. I am proud to see the legacy of this great team and great city carry on. Go, Ticats, go."
I can confirm that the PS4 billion is funded. I can confirm that the investment in autonomous and drone technology in this Parliament is double what was planned before the election. I can confirm that we will spend and invest that money it in this Parliament. I always like coming to Plymouth; my hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces drags me down there frequently.
I call the shadow Minister.
"As I said, this is about phasing out animal experiments in research. I hope that the example of scientific experimentation the hon. Gentleman has given would be possible without animal research in years to come."
"Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister said he wants to build big projects. Does the minister agree?"
"Mr. Chair, the minister said earlier that they brought immigrants in because of COVID. All right, there is a lot to unpack here. There are 500,000 people, as of December 2024, who should have been removed from Canada. How many were removed?"
The hon. member.
"Mr. Speaker, since this is the first time on my feet in the 45th Parliament, I would like to thank the good people of Kelowna, B.C. for placing their trust and confidence in me and electing me to the House for the second time. Yesterday, the Prime Minister confirmed that Canada will meet its NATO 2% targets this fiscal year, five years ahead of schedule, with an additional investment of $9.3 billion. We are accelerating procurement, modernizing capabilities and ensuring the troops have the tools and equipment they need to protect Canada and Canadians."
Where do you get your numbers?
"My right hon. Friend, not uncharacterist-ically, has made an excellent point and I entirely agree with her. As I said yesterday, the Minister has had a unique opportunity with this Bill--a detailed and potentially groundbreaking Bill--to fundamentally change the  planning processes in this country for the better. He told us many times on the Bill Committee that he was reflecting on some of the genuine points and key concerns that Members from across the House brought to him. However, those reflections amounted to nothing. He consistently said that he would reflect on the genuine principles that we brought forward, but we have seen no changes in the legislation. We have seen no acceptance of our thoughts and no efforts to change this legislation to reflect the genuine concerns that so many of us brought to this place. The Liberal Democrats tabled many amendments and new clauses. As the Minister knows, I very rarely praise the Liberal Democrats on the Floor of the House or in my constituency of Hamble Valley, and I am not likely to do so going forward. However, what I would say is that the hon. Member for Taunton and Wellington (Gideon Amos) and his colleague, the hon. Member for Didcot and Wantage (Olly Glover), tabled some really good and principled amendments that would have this improved this legislation, particularly on chalk streams and on some of our other concerns."
"May I say to the right hon. Lady, whom I have known for a little while, that normally when a Speaker upbraids the Leader of the House, the first response of the Leader of the House is to grovel and apologise? That is standard, because she has to take it for the party that she represents in government. I simply suggest that I am a little surprised that she did not make peace in that way with Mr Speaker. Notwithstanding that, I say gently to the Leader of the House that it is not just a case of not having brought the review to the House. We know now that journalists were given scrutiny of it. When I was leader of the Conservative party, I remember that Tony Blair, as Prime Minister, offered me advance sight of documents that were a bit delicate or needed security clearance. The Leader of the Opposition was given the opportunity to look at such documents so that they were fully informed of developments. Was such an opportunity offered to the Leader of the Opposition or the leader of the Liberal party?"
"there is a lot of noise coming from the other side claiming that House Republicans are cutting Medicaid with our commonsense work requirements. Let me be clear: That is just not true. You can't cut something from someone who was never or is no longer eligible to receive it. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, of the 7.8 million people Democrats say would lose coverage, 4.8 million are able- bodied adults with no kids who could work, but don't. Another 1.4 million are in the country illegally and 2.2 million simply don't qualify under the law already. Medicaid should serve the truly needy, not those who refuse to help themselves. House Republicans don't cut Medicaid. That is not what we are doing in this bill. We restore its integrity because work requirements are not a punishment. They are a path to dignity and independence."
"Mr. Speaker, it is really rich when a member of the old government, purporting to be the new government, stands up and does not accept responsibility or accountability for what went on in the past. The Liberals want us to forget about the past. They want us to forget about all the corruption, all the cronyism and all the kleptocracy that went on, where government insiders and well-connected friends and families benefited as a result of the Liberals' being in power, while the people they governed suffered. They continue to suffer. People need the money back. They want the money back. There has to be accountability in the government, and that is what we are asking for with the motion."
"Mr. Speaker, I empathize tonight with all the members from the northern Saskatchewan and Manitoba communities that are impacted. It is unfortunate that in a time of crisis, when people are in dire need and government is working to coordinate an effective response to evacuate people, we see in this House the Conservatives try to politicize and blame the government for wildfires, which we know are fundamentally connected to the climate crisis. The frequency of these extreme weather events, including wildfires, has been increasing. I know the member opposite has been one of the climate deniers in this House whom I have seen, time and time again, propagate all kinds of different conspiracy theories to essentially not acknowledge the science. She said that the Liberals are turning a blind eye. I think she has turned a blind eye to climate change. Will she finally accept that climate change is real?"
"Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is National Indigenous Peoples Day. Every June 21, Canadians take the time to reflect on our past. We also celebrate the significant contributions of first nations, Inuit and Métis people from coast to coast to coast. After generations of pain and suffering, our country has chosen to deliberately walk the path of reconciliation. We must do this together. Can the Minister of Indigenous Services reflect on the importance of National Indigenous Peoples Day here in Canada and across Turtle Island?"
moved that the bill be read the third time and passed.
"Mr. Chair, a number of stakeholders in Quebec's housing sector have been saying that housing programs are too complex for a long time. The Bloc Québécois strongly believes that federal programs need to be simplified and aligned with Quebec programs, since Quebec has jurisdiction over housing. Are discussions being held with the Government of Quebec to make sure that federal programs do not hinder the transfer of funds or make it harder for organizations to apply for programs?"
"My hon. Friend is committed to these issues, although I am sure she would not expect me to speculate at this point about what hypothetical next steps might be. I am sure I will be returning to this House, and I am sure I will continue to discuss these issues with her."
"Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Nanaimo—Ladysmith . I am rising today on this motion because I will not stand here and let the “new” government deceive Canadians any longer. This so-called plan props up monopolies and makes life more unaffordable for Canadians under the guise of saving carbon emissions. This ban on gas-powered vehicles is exactly that. I must call out the Liberal hypocrisy. The government has not met even one of its environmental targets in this last decade, yet it has the nerve to keep imposing its unaffordable, ineffective climate agenda on Canadians. Tonight, I want to cover three things: how the bill is in fact not sustainable or environmentally friendly; how it makes life in Canada even more unaffordable; and lastly, how this is classic Liberal lying and, ultimately, another broken promise. Starting next year, the Liberals will be rolling out a zero-emission vehicle mandate that will become more extreme over the years. By 2026, automakers and importers will be forced to ensure that 20% of their vehicle sales are zero-emission. That target jumps to 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. Within just a decade, sales of gas-powered vehicles will be banned entirely. While the Liberals lecture the rest of Canadians from their elitist circles, they seem to forget that Canadians do not like what they have done and that EVs simply do not work everywhere. In fact, in some areas, like my community, there is no facility to safely recycle the batteries that EVs use. According to the Canadian Automobile Association, electric vehicles can lose up to 40% of their battery life in weather from -7°C to -15°C. For northern British Columbians, starting an electric vehicle in winter is basically impossible. Should this mandate stop families from taking their kids to school or hockey practice? What is the government doing? Do the Liberals think that BC Hydro, Ontario hydro and Hydro-Québec are ready to charge tens of millions of EVs every night, all while keeping up with the growing residential and industrial demands? I will answer that. They are simply not ready for that. To make matters worse, the government continually blocks pipelines and energy projects across the country to line the pockets of foreign dictators. Why can it not admit that exporting foreign oil emits more carbon emissions than using clean Canadian energy? It would be far more affordable for Canadians if the government focused on developing our own natural resources. It should let Canadians work in pipeline and LNG programs, let them drive Canadian-made vehicles and let them heat their homes and start their cars with Canadian energy. Instead, the government is restricting consumer choice, driving up costs and punishing working families with policies like prioritizing ideology over affordability. This is not a climate plan; this is a control plan, a Trojan Horse for a top-down mandate dressed up in green buzzwords. It will prop up monopolies, kneecap working Canadians and hand more power to the Liberals while pretending to save the planet. It will not just make cars more unaffordable. It will drive prices through the roof, shut down auto plants and send thousands of Canadian jobs straight to the U.S. economy. A study in the Canadian Journal of Economics found that this mandate will eliminate 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy up to $138.7 billion. However, it is not just the auto sector that is at risk. It is the everyday Canadians who work in rural areas and rely on trucks, long commutes and reliable vehicles just to get to work. This mandate hits the very people who keep our resource industry running, like forestry, fishing, mining, and oil and gas. They will be the ones who will end up paying the price. Liberals' policies are already making life much harder for Canadians, especially those in resource sectors, so why are they targeting them again? Let us not forget that life is already very much a struggle for the everyday Canadian. Think about the single mom who must drive her kids from school and day care to hockey practice, or the senior in a rural community who just wants to commute to their medical appointment. Do the Liberals really think the average Canadian can pay for a brand-new electric vehicle? Under their mandate, every year the Liberals crank up their EV quota, manufacturers will not keep up because they will be forced to buy credits that cost up to $20,000. Guess who gets stuck with that bill in the end. It is Canadians. The Liberals act like the cost vanishes into thin air, but it all gets passed down to the Canadian consumer. For most Canadians, a reliable gas-powered car is not a luxury but a lifeline. This mandate would push the very people who can afford it the least. The Liberals want to force top-down decisions, take away choices from hard-working Canadians and call it “green” while ignoring the damaging impacts. It is time to bring some common sense back to the government. No one should be told what kind of car they need to drive. Conservatives, especially, will not force Canadians to buy a vehicle they do not want, cannot afford and cannot count on. It is not just Conservatives raising concerns. Even former Liberal MPs are pushing back on the new government's electric vehicle mandate. Former Liberal MP Dan McTeague also said this is the wrong policy for Canada. The truth is that the Liberals think they know better than the average Canadian. The government is not interested in choice but wants to dictate how Canadians live, what they drive and how they spend their money. Conservatives believe in something different. We believe in freedom, practicality and respecting our Canadian workers. EVs are great for many families, who always should be free to purchase the vehicle of their choice. For many Canadians who live in cold environments or travel long distances, they are practically useless, especially without the infrastructure to power them. That is why the Conservatives have put forward a motion to protect Canadians' right to choose in their everyday lives. Soon this House will have a choice: Will it vote in favour of the Conservative motion that calls on the Liberal government to immediately end the ban on gas-powered vehicles, or will it take away the choice for Canadians for generations to come? I urge my colleagues to vote in good conscience for the Conservative motion, not just because it makes sense economically or environmentally but because it defends something even more fundamental: our right to choose what to do with our lives. At its core, this motion is about freedom and personal choice, values that built this country and must never be taken for granted. Canadians were promised leadership, but instead they got bureaucracy. They were promised jobs, but instead they got pink slips. They were promised a choice, but instead they are being told exactly what to drive. Canadians were promised change, but instead they received empty slogans and rising costs. I guess it is not elbows up. I guess it is elbows down."
"Let me begin by emphasising that all women in England and Wales can access safe, regulated abortions on the NHS under our current laws. I also recognise and respect that there are strongly held views across the House on this highly sensitive issue, and I welcome the considered and informed debate we have had today. The Government maintain a neutral stance on changing the criminal law on abortion in England and Wales. We maintain that it is for Parliament to decide the circumstances under which abortion should take place, and will allow Members to vote according to their moral, ethical or religious beliefs. If it is the will of the House that the criminal law on abortion should change, whether by our exempting pregnant women from the offences or otherwise, the Government would not stand in the way of such change. However, we must ensure coherence between the statute book and any legislation proposed. It will be helpful if I first set out the relevant law. As hon. Members will know, in England and Wales, the criminal offences relating to abortion must be read in conjunction with the provisions of the Abortion Act 1967, which provide exemptions to the criminal offences. The Act defines the circumstances in which abortions or terminations can legally take place. Section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 is the offence of administering drugs or using instruments to procure an abortion. It is an offence for a pregnant woman to unlawfully take a drug or use instruments with the intent of procuring her own miscarriage. It is also an offence for another person who has the intent of procuring the miscarriage of a woman, whether or not she is pregnant, to unlawfully administer drugs or use instruments with that intent. It is also an offence under section 59 of the 1861 Act for a person to supply or procure drugs, poison or an instrument that was intended to be used to procure a miscarriage. The Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 deals with acts in the later stages of pregnancies, including late-term abortions in England and Wales. Under section 1 of the 1929 Act, it is an offence for any person to intentionally destroy the life of a child before it is born, if it is capable of being born alive, unless it can be proved that the act was done in good faith and only to preserve the life of the woman. Turning to the amendments, the purpose of new clause 1, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Tonia Antoniazzi), is to disapply criminal offences relating to abortion from a woman acting in relation to her own pregnancy at any gestation. This means that it would never be a criminal offence for a pregnant woman to terminate her pregnancy, regardless of the number of weeks of gestation, including beyond the 24 weeks."
What recent progress his Department has made on strengthening national resilience.
"Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from King—Vaughan for her excellent speech and especially for her advocacy for seniors. I introduced a private members' bill in the 42nd Parliament to eliminate the mandatory RRIF withdrawals entirely. It would help seniors. I want to note that every single member of the Liberal Party voted against that and actually voted against affordability for seniors. To get back to the bill, one of the failures of Bill C-2 is that every penny of these tax cuts is coming from borrowed money. The Conservative plan was costed; we were going to reduce reliance on Liberal-friendly consulting companies instead of packing on the debt. I wonder if my colleague thinks that, perhaps, instead of adding more debt, the Liberals should cut back the billions they are giving to their friends at McKinsey and other management consulting companies."
"I thank my hon. Friend, who is an assiduous and very qualified member of the Committee, and often puts me to shame in relation to my knowledge of matters. Anybody who listened to Dame Vera's interview on the ""Today"" programme this week, in which she addressed several times the report and these findings, as well as three other reports that there have been over the past 10 years, will be under no illusion about whether she understands the scale of the task she faces and has the skills to tackle it."
"Rusty's  Collectables is a great new addition to Redditch high street, offering unique items such as Pokemon and Marvel collectables. Owners Russell and Amee have successfully moved from online to the high street. Can the Minister explain how the Government will help more entrepreneurs like them to turn great ideas into high-street businesses?"
Is that agreed?
I ask unanimous consent to waive the mandatory quorum call with respect to the Scott nomination.
I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.
"I am coming to my conclusion. New clause 15 will protect bereaved families such as that of my constituent Anthony, and therefore I urge hon. Members to support it."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. This rescissions package does reduce certain global health accounts by hundreds of millions. Keep in mind that $10 billion has been appropriated for this work in these accounts, making this rescission exact and very targeted. The Trump administration has communicated it will not reduce funds for treatment in PEPFAR, rather it eliminates programs antithetical to American interests and ones that worsen the lives of women and children. Enacting this rescission will get this funding stream back to its core mission by refocusing it on protecting health and supporting life-sustaining treatment. What we don't need is the wasteful spending priorities of President Biden now exposed by the Trump administration: $500,000 for a Lesbian Justice Foundation in Canada; $9.3 million to the John Snow Research and Training Institute to advise Russian doctors on how to perform abortions and gender analysis; $800,000 for transgender people, sex workers and their clients and sexual networks in Nepal; $7.4 million for a One Health Workforce project whose curriculum includes teaching practitioners about environmental racism and the importance of DEI. This spending, guised under the terms ``equity, reproductive health, and family planning,'' stray far from the mission of sustaining life and serve no benefit to the populations they are intended to help. These are wasteful programs financed by the American taxpayer, funded by deficit spending; but no longer. This money is better off returned to the Treasury, and PEPFAR's integrity is now being restored. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman)."
"Mr. Speaker, I have taken careful note. Of course, standing committees will be constituted in this House, as they always are. I wonder where that member was last fall, when his party spent three straight months refusing to hear one single government proposal with respect to improving the lives of Canadians, with respect to improving our environment and with respect to moving forward on projects. Where was that member? He should be ashamed of asking that question right now."
"I draw attention to my entry in the Register of Members' Financial Interests. My constituent Bruno lives in Charlton-on-Otmoor. When it rains heavily, sewage flows into his garden, which is within sight of a pumping station that fails every single time. One third of bills paid to Thames Water by Bruno and other customers is used to service the company's debt; that money should instead be invested, and should go towards improving pumping stations like the one near Bruno's garden. Why will the Secretary of State not recognise that Thames is financially unviable, bring it into special administration, write down the debt and ensure that the future company serves the public interest?"
"Mr. Speaker, I rise to honour and remember three incredible kids whose lives have been cut short in an unimaginable tragedy: Ramone, Jace and Mya Laviña-Galve. They are victims of a drunk driver, such an inexplicably reckless and awful crime that we should do more to prevent. They will be remembered for the wonderful kids they were, all of them with such a bright future. Ramone, an athletic 15-year-old, loved basketball. Classmates called him kind, genuine, thoughtful, a great listener and a friend to everybody, the leader of the pack. Jace, 13 years old, loved basketball, too. No matter his team, he cheered for everyone on the court. The only grade 7 pupil on student council, he was a future leader who was genuinely loved by all. Mya, only six years old, loved purses and fashion, and she wanted to be a cheerleader. She was always smiling and dancing. She believed in everybody, lifted people up and lit up every room. Our community and Parliament grieve with the Laviña-Galve family, especially their mom, Jade, and remaining sibling, who are both in recovery, and we will remember Ramone, Jace and Mya."
I know of no further debate on the nominee.
"I am confident that the Secretary of State loves the pub as much as you and I do, Mr Speaker, but the jobs tax and the slashing of business rate relief have delivered a hammer blow to pubs such as the Barrel in Walkington, owned by Thwaites, and to hospitality businesses such as the Beverley Arms hotel. Has the Secretary of State made representations to the Chancellor ahead of Wednesday to ensure that more landlords are not forced to call last orders?"
"Madam Chair, the minister prepared a spending plan, but he did not make the time to prepare a plan for how he was going to pay for it. Why is that?"
"There appears to be universal support for this damascene conversion by the Government. Last year, they told pensioners that the right course of action was to scrap the winter fuel payment for millions, but they are now telling them that a means-tested system is right, so how can pensioners possibly believe anything that the Government say?"
"Mr. Speaker, we hear a lot of rhetoric from the Liberal government about making Canada an energy superpower, but its commitment to job-killing anti-Canadian energy legislation holds back our potential as a nation. The actions needed today are to repeal the no new pipeline bill, Bill C-69 ; repeal the shipping ban bill, Bill C-48 ; repeal the job-killing oil and gas production cap; and repeal the industrial carbon tax. Will the Liberal government take action today, the action needed, to repeal its anti-energy agenda?"
"Mr. Speaker, Canadian bars and restaurants are grappling with a wave of extortion. The Montreal and Laval regions are no exception. In the past year, there have been dozens of these offences. Bars and restaurants have been burned down and have been the target of gunfire. Over the past 10 years, the justice system has collapsed. Gang leaders use illegal cell phones to give orders to their underlings from prison. Gang members commit crimes with total impunity. Can the Minister of Public Safety ask the justice minister to change the laws so that order is restored in Canada?"
"Mr. Speaker, it was a true honour to lead a delegation of Canadian parliamentarians to Dayton, Ohio, for the spring session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, where parliamentarians from all NATO countries assembled for discussions. Dayton was selected to honour the 30th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accord, which marked the end of the Bosnian War. Given the changing geopolitical situation and Canada's strong commitment to secure and defend our borders, the vital role that NATO plays cannot be understated. The Dayton session provided an excellent opportunity for NATO parliamentarians to reaffirm our support for Ukraine, that we must support Ukraine until it wins, and to lend our voice to creating a more resilient NATO. I am proud that Canada announced increased defence spending, to 2% of our GDP by the end of this year. This means an additional $9 billion of investment in our Canadian Armed Forces. We made a commitment to Canadians to protect our sovereignty and to defend our country, and we will do so, both today and for generations to come."
"Madam Chair, once again, I did not get an answer. Following the first cabinet meeting on May 14, the Minister of Finance publicly announced that there would be no budget this year, but rather an economic update. However, the Prime Minister rebuked him two days later and said that there would be a budget this fall. Did the minister make a mistake, or did the Prime Minister call him to heel?"
I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.
"I know that the Under-Secretary of State for Education, my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth South (Stephen Morgan), has been in touch with the hon. Lady recently to discuss this matter further, and I personally will happily look further into the case that she has raised. We are investing record sums in early years education and working with the sector to deliver the places that are needed. That is a big challenge, because the last Tory Government did not leave behind a plan to deliver those places."
"Mr. Speaker, while we were prorogued, we had a special constituent born: Remi Robson Murray, the grandchild of my former teacher Cam Murray and the child of Aidan and Jessie. I welcome Remi to our great Kamloops—Thompson—Nicola. I also want to give a special shout-out to my goddaughter, who is celebrating her graduation this weekend, Emery Britton. It has been a pleasure and an a honour watching her grow into the young woman she is. I am so proud of her. To my hon. colleague, we have heard a lot of talk from the Liberals. Would he agree that over the last 10 years, their talk and their rhetoric have not matched their actions?"
I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Malliotakis).
"Madam Speaker, I want to make it clear that our Conservative Party, while supporting tax cuts, does believe that the proposal from the Prime Minister 's government does not go far enough. We think Canadians deserve more relief from the massive increases in higher taxes that they have received after the last nine and a half years of the Liberal government. The government needs to go further. That is why we are calling for a spring budget to deliver more relief for Manitobans, Westman residents and Canadian families who are struggling to put food on the table."
"There are 3,566 veterans in my constituency, of which 28% are disabled. Many are concerned about the future support available to them. Can the Minister assure disabled veterans, not just in South Northamptonshire but across the country, what the Department will do, and that it will not forget them?"
"Mr. Speaker, that was an interesting question. Of course, when Canadians look at their budgets for their own households, they realize they have to scrutinize each and every cost item. They have to craft and propose a budget. I always wonder why the government feels it does not have to do the same. Absolutely, if the government wants to increase spending by half a trillion dollars or, rather, wants to add half a trillion dollars' worth of spending, it should definitely put forward a budget. It is unacceptable for the government not to do so."
"Ha, ha! That's not true."
"I rise today to honor Mike Leach, a dear friend, a brilliant coach, and one of the most original minds college football has ever known. His long overdue path to the College Football Hall of Fame was finally cleared with last week's decision to revise the hall's eligibility criteria. As such, Mike Leach will be eligible for the Hall of Fame in 2027. Mike Leach wasn't just a coach. He was the most influential mind in college football in the last 30 years. No one is more deserving of being in the Hall of Fame. Mike was a pioneer. He was the architect of the Air Raid offense, a system that changed the game andlaunched the careers of countless players and coaches. It revolutionized football from the high school level to the heights of the NFL. More than that, Mike Leach was a thinker and a storyteller. In life, for me, he was a cherished friend. Most Hall of Fame coaches inherit programs steeped in tradition. Mike didn't. In fact, he didn't even play football at the college level. He was a rugby player who earned a law degree. He took on the challenge of rebuilding, starting at the lowest levels of college football. He worked his way up in the true American Dream fashion.  He coached at Texas Tech, Mississippi State, and, most importantly for me, at Washington State University. He didn't just win games; he changed cultures. He made football fun, fearless, and innovative. Off the field, Mike was just as remarkable. A few years back, together, we created and taught the insurgent warfare in football class at Washington State University, which we then taught on a special basis at Mississippi State University. When I first met Mike, I had come off some time working with the State Department in Iraq where I had the privilege of working very closely with General Petraeus and came to know General Mattis. When I thought about Mike and the connection to football and how he was an innovator and an insurgent warrior, I thought about the football analogy. General Petraeus and General Mattis would be a little more like Nick Saban. How do we win when we have all the heavy firepower, the four-star and five-star recruits? Mike was more like Ho Chi Minh, sitting out in the jungle. How do we win with two-star recruits and three-star recruits? We created this class to look at asymmetric strategy. It was a great success and great fun. Mike and I would speak two to three times per week, often about politics and culture. Together, we traveled the world, visiting over 10 countries, from Israel to Dubai, Tanzania to Panama. He was a pirate with a playbook. He was intellectually curious, endlessly witty, and genuinely kind. His insights on leadership, war, and human nature are a fundamental reason of why I am here today. Mike and I also talked about him running for office someday. Not many folks know that, but he looked seriously at coming to Congress. At the time he did so, I told him that he has a young team. He is making over $5 million a year. He can always run again. Unfortunately, he was taken from us too soon when he passed. His legacy lives on, and his greatest love was for people, for his players, his friends, and his family. Coach Leach finished with a career just .004 below the previous threshold-winning percentage for the Hall of Fame. With last week's decision by the National Football Foundation to revise the rule, the door is now open, and rightfully so. If the Hall of Fame is about more than just numbers, if it is about impact, innovation, and legacy, then Mike Leach belongs there without question. I urge the foundation to complete this long overdue recognition. Mr. Speaker, I say to my friend, who I have no doubt is watching Congress every day, that he always did things his own way. Now, even the Hall of Fame is catching up to him."
"Madam Speaker, we can definitely always innovate more. As the representative for the riding of Waterloo, I can say that we believe in innovation and in competition. There have been other members within the Conservative Party trying to understand what would happen once the legislation passes. They have been kind of misquoting the Prime Minister as saying that the legislation would actually be removing any federal barriers to interprovincial trade. Does the member agree we are a federation and that all levels of government would have a role to play to ensure that we have interprovincial trade within Canada that is barrier-free, that all levels would have to pass legislation and that this is the federal aspect?"
"Madam Speaker, I know the member went through an election experience, as all of us did, during which the issue she referenced on why we have Bill C-2 in front of us today was hotly discussed. We have a very clear mandate from Canadians, who anticipate that as a collective House of Commons, we pass legislation of this nature. Does the member feel any sense of obligation to see the legislation pass before the House rises for the summer?"
"Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the member on his excellent work on this. One of the things I noticed while talking to people in my riding and in other places during the election was how frustrating it is for people who work in law enforcement when they see the failures on crime of the Liberal government. There are people who go out and work hard every day, risking their lives to try to keep the rest of us safe. When they catch someone involved in crime, very often they are released on bail, even if it is a repeat violent offender. I wonder if the member can share a little about how the approach the Liberals have taken is impacting law enforcement and what the response has been to the actions of the government by those who work on the front lines."
"I am always in the market for less pain. Let me say a little bit about some of the constraints. Eligible bids have been submitted to our contracts for difference schemes, but unfortunately none has yet been successful. That is because the cost of floating solar is about 10% to 15% higher than those of ground-mounted projects, and the reason for that is the cost of the floating structures on which the panel sits. And we hear from the sector that these can account for nearly half of the cost of the project. Moreover, floating solar requires expensive underwater cables, which costs more than land-based systems. Therefore, although we are very keen to encourage this technology and to encourage the sector to grow, there is more that needs to be done in order to make them cost effective. From a Government perspective, it is critical that every scheme and every project that we support is cost-effective, so that, in the end, taxpayers are not footing the bill for technology that is too expensive."
"Mr. Speaker, while I thank the member for providing a precis of that commentary, the truth is, as I have said before, that the most important thing is how we work to build Canada as an energy superpower that is low-cost, low-risk and low-carbon. That is a task that Canadians have given us to do, and that is what we will work on."
Star pupil of the day.
"we have heard a little bit of concerns about 1071. There is a huge difference between what we are requiring in this and what 1071 required. That was for all businesses, for all loans. It was not voluntary, and if businesses did not comply, they could actually be fined. What we are asking for is simply verification of legal status and age for companies that are applying for American taxpayer-backed loans. Now, this should not surprise anybody. This proposed rule increases lending security and ensures that taxpayer dollars are used well. Further, participating in government lending programs like the 7(a) program naturally involves complying with government rules. This is no different. U.S. taxpayer dollars back the SBA lending programs, and adding additional assurances, like age and legal status verification, making sure loans go to lawful citizens is just common sense. Lender concerns related to nationality discrimination are nonsensical. This law does not prohibit lending based on nationality but rather on legal residency or status."
"Mr. Speaker, Canadians are struggling to put food on the table now, and it is because of the Liberals' inflationary spending. We all knew these were going to be the same old tax-and-spend Liberals, but we had no idea the Prime Minister was going to be worse. He promised Canadians he would cap increased spending at 2%; he has gone over 8%. That is putting Canadians in trouble, and they are the ones paying the price. We now have the highest food inflation in the G7. Will the Prime Minister table a budget and end his inflationary spending so Canadians can afford to feed their families?"
The NDP agrees to apply the vote and will be voting against.
"So fuelled by optimism am I today that even the shadow Secretary of State cannot bring me down. Having been in opposition for some time, I can say that, ""This document is all rubbish and I welcome most of it,"" is quite an exciting take on a response. The Conservative party has managed to oppose almost everything that the Government have done in their first year, including, in my Department, the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill, which the previous Government were planning to introduce had they remained in office, and the India trade deal, which they were negotiating but could not get across the line, so I welcome the small bits of positivity in his response. Everyone across the House should support the strategy. It is based on things that will not be secrets to hon. Members who spend time with businesses on constituency Fridays and at weekends. They will be told about skills, energy, access to finance and how local areas should have the powers to address the needs in their local economies. I hope that the shadow Secretary of State would recognise, in good spirit, that many of the problems that need to be addressed grew under the Conservative Government. For example, the fact that energy bills became so uncompetitive was a result of actions and decisions of the Conservative Government. We are fixing that problem, in order to make a difference. On skills, one in eight young people are not in education, employment or training, while net immigration is at 1 million. That is not a policy success. It needed to be addressed. We needed to address, too, the failures on the funding of courses such as engineering. That was such an obvious need for our sectors. Finance is one of the longest-running problems; we are all familiar with it. The shadow Secretary of State asked a number of questions, and I am more than happy to answer them. On small businesses, if he reads more of the detail when he has a bit more time, he will see that small and medium-sized enterprises play a vital role in the creative industries and defence sector plans. To anyone who asks, ""What's the message to businesses that are not in sectors covered by the industrial strategy?"" I say that they will benefit from people having good jobs and high incomes. Whether they are in hospitality, retail or leisure, they will see a direct benefit from the strategy. The small business plan will come out in July, and it will deal with issues such as late payment, business support and access to the kinds of tools--rental auctions and so forth--that will make a difference on the high street. The shadow Secretary of State attacked net zero. That is a mistake. Why would we turn our back on billions of pounds of investment and all the benefits it could bring? In particular, becoming a country that is not so reliant on volatile foreign gas prices is an obvious  thing that we would not want to turn our back on. He seemed to announce a new Conservative position of opposing CBAMs, which deal with carbon leakage and create a level playing field. I am surprised by that, because the previous Conservative Government were strong advocates of them. On the bioethanol industry, talks continue with the two plants most directly affected. Of course, they were in a challenging position before the US trade deal; the deal was not in itself the cause of that. They were losing money. If I intervene, I must have a route to profitability, and that is the basis of those conversations. We are committed to precision breeding. Businesses that moved to France would find a more restrictive environment there because of EU regulation, so I would not recommend that. On OneWeb, there are some specific issues, about which I would be more than happy to talk to the shadow Secretary of State. On regulation, we have already taken decisive action, for example with a strategic steer to the Competition and Markets Authority, which has been warmly welcomed by businesspeople. They ask me for more of that, and that is exactly what we intend to bring forward. Finally, let me say, because I know that this is so important to colleagues, that I am more than happy to offer a briefing to any Front-Bench spokesperson or group of colleagues across the House. There is so much in the strategy that will make a difference and so much detail worth sharing, and I would be more than happy to do so with colleagues. Let us all get behind the strategy and get behind British industry."
"It is important to be focused on the facts at issue. We do not support spy flights; we have a limited presence to try and find hostages in Gaza, for reasons that the whole House would understand and support. There are fewer than 10 IDF personnel receiving any training in the UK, and that training is academic and non-military in nature. We are not arming Israel's war in Gaza. We categorically do not export any bombs or ammunition for use in military operations in Gaza. My hon. Friend asks about an independent inquiry. The Government welcome scrutiny and I welcome my time in this Chamber. On the questions at issue on arms sales, including on the F-35 programme, there is a judicial review on which we will hear findings shortly. There is plenty of scrutiny of this Government."

"Mr. Speaker, the Green Party also agrees to apply the vote and will be voting in favour of the motion."
"I thank the hon. Lady for so eloquently describing some of the variation in the use of drugs in the case of assisted dying. In normal practice we have a yellow card scheme, which allows for any adverse events from ingestion of prescribed medication to be reported. Is it her understanding that, under the current proposals, that would not happen for assisted dying? Is she also aware of a review that shows a great variation in the range and dosages of drugs used?"
"I will not; I am short of time. Just how strong are the Bill's safeguards? We are not commentators; we are legislators. Our job is to scrutinise, to test and to test again the Bills that come to this place. I spent 26 years up there in the Press Gallery writing about politics, but the big difference between them and us is that we have a vote in this place. With that vote, particularly a free vote, comes responsibility, and there is no greater responsibility than protecting the vulnerable from feeling they have to end their life. That is why I tabled the amendment. I am not driven by religion, though I do not believe that those with religious faiths should be denigrated or patronised, as they have been during the passage of the Bill. It is worth saying that some of those who passionately support assisted dying have a faith--a devout faith--that their world view is the right one. I am driven instead by my duty as a legislator to get this Bill right, and by what I see as my moral duty to protect the most vulnerable in society. I believe that my duty is to protect those who do not have celebrity names or campaign groups behind them--the people who do not get heard, who do not want to be a bother, who do not want to make a fuss, and who feel at the end of their lives that they are a burden on their family but may never say so. I worry about the unheard, the unseen, the ignored and the marginalised. Most of all, I worry about the heartbreaking modesty of that phrase we often hear from older people: ""I don't want to be any trouble, love."" We need, for their sakes, to make sure that the safeguards in the Bill are the strongest they can possibly be."

"Mr. Speaker, I always find it interesting that the member opposite, probably more so than any Conservative member, and maybe she could even be the new leader of the Conservative Party at some point, tries to portray a false impression that in the Harper horror years, the Conservatives were able to develop an inch of pipeline to tidewater. They did not. Not even an inch of pipeline went to tidewater. When we take a look at Bill C-5 and the April 28 election, it is important for us to realize that a very clear mandate was given to all political entities in this House to build one Canadian economy. Does the member not agree that the essence of—"
The parliamentary secretary to the government House leader is rising on a point of order.
"I am disappointed. I was very present when the majority leader said that on this bill, there will be an open amendment process, and we made it very clear that this was one of the issues that we felt we should be debating while we are on a cryptocurrency bill. There are other amendments that should be considered as well. One of them is to stop a form of scam that bypasses a bank teller by getting older folks to think they are wiring money to perhaps a nephew or grandchild in distress, but instead of wiring the funds, they go and get digital coins at an ATM as instructed, but, in fact, they are just giving the money to crooks overseas. That amendment should be considered. There are other amendments that address creating more sideboards so that this bill, which purports to regulate an industry, actually regulates it in an effective fashion rather than essentially endorsing an unregulated industry, which is what, in sum, this bill is currently. So I am disappointed. I would, as I asked earlier, ask for the majority leader to honor his previous commitment to have an open amendment process so that we can pursue the people's work, fighting for a better America, including ending corruption in cryptocurrencies."
"Mr. Speaker, I am wondering if my colleague and friend could provide his thoughts in regard to the notion that it seems to be more of a divisive motion the Bloc is raising. This is not just about the province of Quebec. Quebec and British Columbia have played a very strong leadership role on the environment, but neither of those provinces participated in the federal backstop program. Could the member provide a quick comment on that issue?"
"Mr. Chair, how many of these oil and gas pipelines are in the construction phase?"
Does the minister think victims are adequately respected in the Canadian criminal justice system?
"I am thrilled and excited by the prospect of being part of that work, and I look forward to joining the Minister, but I think that it must be as open as possible so that every single aspect of this can be harnessed and used as part of the Government's work. What the Government amendments do not do, however--and this is a key issue--is pay attention to the transparency issues. The peers have rejected amendments that the Government have tabled previously. As the Chair of the Select Committee said, the Government are bringing these amendments back to try to distract us and give us the impression that they listened to the House of Lords and were near to reaching a compromise, but nothing of the sort is the case, because the key issue is the transparency that the House of Lords, the creative sector and artists across the UK want to see. The existing law should be enforced to protect the wages of 2.4 million creative workers, and the Government must produce a ""meaningful compromise"" amendment. It is also entirely possible for the Government to take powers to introduce transparency via regulations, recognising the urgent need to prevent mass theft by AI firms at the earliest opportunity, and I do not know why they have not explored that option. The wages of those 2.4 million UK creators are at stake, as is the principle of the rule of law. The creative industries have made it clear that inaction on the Government's part is giving  ""big tech"" the freedom to break our laws and destroy jobs. Copyright is not an abstract concept; it is what secures our creative success. The Government will win in this House today, and they will probably win the whole debate--they will get their way. However, they have lost the battle. One good thing that has come out of this is the fact that people now understand that our copyright laws--our gold-standard copyright regime--underpins the success of the UK's creative industries across the board. Some of the greatest artists in the world are from these islands, and they have achieved their success because of intellectual property rights and our copyright laws. To muck about with those as we have over the past few months undermines all that, and undermines the ability of those artists to continue to lead in their sectors. I hope that, even at this late stage, some sort of compromise can be found with transparency at the heart of it, and I appeal to the Minister to consider that seriously."
"I want to join my colleagues in talking about one of the terrible elements of this bill, and that is it is going to take away Medicaid coverage, healthcare for--this morning, it was 13.7 million people across this country, including Vermont and including Missouri. But we just got an update: It is 16 million people; 16 million people are going to lose healthcare. And this Medicaid Program that provides access to low-income folks, to kids with disabilities, and, of course, those parents who do so much to care for their child with special needs--they need that Medicaid to be able to keep body and soul together and give thatchild that they love the best they can possibly have. It provides healthcare for two out of three seniors who are in nursing homes. Medicaid pays for those hospital beds. So how is it that at a time when healthcare is expensive--it is getting out of reach for more and more people; it is the biggest expense many families face--that we are actually considering in the U.S. Senate a bill that would take away healthcare from 16 million people? It is hard to believe that the U.S. Senate has any degree of appreciation for the reality of the everyday lives of folks who depend on this healthcare. The legislation also takes away subsidies that have made it affordable for people to buy into the Affordable Care Act, known as ObamaCare. It is the margin that is necessary for millions of people to be able to continue to get healthcare coverage through the Affordable Care Act. So we literally have a piece of legislation that is going to take away this healthcare for individuals. It is going to take away healthcare from families who are getting access through the Affordable Care Act. This bill also is cutting nutrition programs. The SNAP benefits really matter for lower income families. It is how they feed their kids. And in your community and in mine, we have thousands of volunteers who put together food shelves, community food programs; they do Meals on Wheels; they volunteer to do everything they possibly can to help our kids in school with nutrition, to help with the Meals on Wheels for our seniors and then, of course, to distribute and help with the SNAP program. Millions of Americans are going to lose that. And, by the way, that SNAP benefit amounts to about 6 bucks a day, maybe a little more. Hardly a big bonanza but an incredibly important component of keeping body and soul together. It is the meals that are so essential to the well-being not just of our seniors but to our children. So all of this is being done as a way of ``paying for'' legislation that is going to lower taxes. And I don't know how it works for you in Missouri, but when I am talking to Vermonters, nobody has come up to me and said: Peter, you have got to get to work on getting me that tax cut. Nobody believes that there is a tax cut in this bill that is going to be anything at all meaningful to them in their struggles with affording paying their bills at the end of each month. Now, if you are in the uberwealthy class, you would get $250,000. That is real money, although for some of those folks who are making millions of dollars a year, it won't even be anything they notice. But why is it that we are pushing through this legislation that will provide a tax cut to folks who, by and large, don't need it, will do very little for working-class people, will have a negative impact on their ability to pay their bills, especially the ones who are going to lose access to Medicaid, especially folks who are going to lose access to food stamps or the SNAP benefits that are so essential to their well-being? And that is on top of all of those folks having to pay more because of the tariffs. So this is an assault on the budgets of working families in America. That is what it really is. It is going to shrink their take-home pay at the end of the month. That is literally what it is we are doing. And for what? To provide a tax cut that is not going to be meaningful for the vast majority of Americans who really will end up paying more through tariffs and lost access to healthcare and nutrition programs than they will ever even in the wildest stretch of the imagination get from the so-called tax cut bill, the Big Beautiful Bill. But there is another part of this that is so damaging, and especially for those of us representing rural America. Individuals need healthcare, but they can't get healthcare unless they can go to a community hospital, unless they can go to a community health center, unless they can go to a private practitioner who accepts Medicaid reimbursement. All of those people who lose access to Medicaid to pay those bills are going to continue to show up at the doctor's office. They are going to show up at the emergency room. They are going to go to our community hospitals. They are going to go to our community health centers. And those health centers and those doctors will continue to do everything that they can to provide care, even if they don't get paid. But at a certain point, they can't continue. They can't keep the doors open, they can't pay salaries to staff. They can't pay the light bill. So what this does is not only take away access to healthcare for individuals, it starts to unravel the healthcare system to deliver healthcare to people in the community. Those institutions that lose the modest revenue reimbursement that you get from Medicaid--far less than Medicare, far less than private pay--are going to lose that revenue. And those institutions, those hospitals, those practices already operating on a very thin margin are going to go out of business. And then what happens? We put all of the pressure for paying for the healthcare system on the private sector. And what we have seen over and over again is the so-called cost shift. It is a real thing. It is not a so-called cost shift; it is real. So the more money you take out of Medicaid, the more money and more burden you put on the private insurance market. And who pays that? A lot of our employers. You know, in Vermont--I am sure this is true in Missouri--our employers care about their employees, and there is a struggle every year for employers who want to provide employer-sponsored healthcare when they get the sticker shock of a 10-, 15-, or a 25-percent increase in premiums. And that always then forces the discussion about ``Do we want to give a raise?'' or ``Do we want to just maintain benefits but pay for the higher premium with what would have been your raise?'' So that is further pressure. So this bill does real harm to individuals, but it really also starts to continue and accelerate the unraveling of a financially insecure medical payment system. So why do we do this? It is hard to answer. You know, it is a theoretical benefit. The theory here is if you lower taxes, you will boost the economy. We have been hearing that since Reagan, and that is very much in dispute, especially when the lower taxes go to folks who don't need it, and the folks who are struggling to pay their bills aren't getting much relief and are getting higher costs from tariffs and getting higher costs because they are losing access to healthcare, and this is going to weaken our communities. And then of course, finally, what we are going to see is a significant increase in our debt. And the recent CBO scores, I think, put it at $2.8 trillion. And what are we getting for that? You know, sometimes a country has to borrow like we did in World War II. Sometimes you have to borrow like we did during COVID. Sometimes you have to borrow to rescue the economy like we did after the 2008 Wall Street crash. And you know why you are doing it. But when you are in better times where you don't have this market collapse, you don't have this mass pandemic, that is not the time to be adding to the debt. And what it does is it means that in the future, if we do have to borrow for an emergency, our capacity to do it is more limited. And what it is also doing right now is raising interest rates. And as interest rates go up, the cost of debt service on our budget goes up. And right now--right now--the biggest expenditure of taxpayer money is to pay interest on the debt that is escalating exponentially. So we are spending more on debt service than we do on the military. We are spending more on debt service than we do on Medicare and way more than we are on Medicaid. And by adding to the debt, it is clearly putting pressure on interest rates, raising what it is taxpayers have to pay. So there is nothing good in this bill for the working person or for their small businesses that when they need to borrow money, they are much better off if they can get a lower rate of interest or when a family has to get a car loan, they can get a lower rate of interest or a mortgage, they can get a lower rate of interest. It is the exact opposite. So we have got families who are paying more because of tariffs, losing a lot because they are losing their Medicaid eligibility and losing their access to the Affordable Care Act, and then everybody is paying more because of thehigh interest associated with the escalation in the debt. We should kill this bill, and I would urge all of my colleagues to take into consideration how this is going to affect the people whom each of us represents. You know, there is a bipartisan element to this bill. The bipartisan aspect of this bill is that everybody is going to share the pain of what this bill does. It is folks in red States. It is the folks in the blue States. Whether they voted for Harris or they voted for Trump, if they lose their Medicaid, that hurts; if they lose their community hospital, that hurts; if they pay higher interest rates, that hurts. Let's come to our senses and vote against this bill. I yield the floor."
"No; what this Government are doing is cleaning up the almighty mess left to us by the previous Government, of which the right hon. Gentleman was a member. He knows full well that I have already signalled an intention to review the powers of the Sentencing Council. We have an upcoming sentencing Bill, and I will take the action that he and his Government never did in 14 long years. [Interruption.] He has suddenly found his voice--he did not have it for a decade or more."
"I note the Secretary of State's reluctance to entertain public ownership, but I draw his attention to research from the University of Greenwich that shows that bringing water into public ownership would pay for itself within about seven years and that, after that, it would save the public purse up to PS2.5 billion a year. Is the Secretary of State aware that immediately bringing Thames Water into special administration and permanent public ownership would cut the company's massive debt mountain in half, stop the payment of huge dividends and debt payments into the future, and within just several years actually start turning a profit for the people of this country?"
"That is exactly why I urge the Government, as I have throughout the passage of the Bill--I know this point was also raised in Committee--to realise the huge level of disenfranchisement it represents for landowners. This Bill is not introducing fairness into the system, because it does not enable the state to pay the market value that should be attributed to anything that is compulsorily acquired. That is why I do not support the Bill, and I will be proud to vote against it on Third Reading."
"Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to my colleague's speech. He suggested that the pipeline is an element of nation-building. The new Canadian identity is taking shape. We neglected this concept for decades, but now the American giant is forcing us to define Canadian identity. Some believe this new identity should be shaped by a pipeline. If I understand correctly, Alberta's gambit was to convince people that it had separatist inclinations and then, at this week's first ministers' meeting, convince everyone that its pipeline construction plan is in the whole country's interest. Does my colleague agree that, if Quebec opposes this project, if Quebec's conditions are not met, the pipeline will not cross Quebec's territory?"
"Madam Chair, on a point of order, I am seeing a pattern here of the minister deliberately giving a response that is substantially longer than the length of time it took to ask the question."
"Uqaqtittiji , before I begin, I would like to acknowledge that June is National Indigenous History Month. I hope we all take any opportunity this month to appreciate and learn about indigenous peoples. For my part, National Indigenous History Month is an opportunity to remind parliamentarians that Inuit, first nations and Métis are brilliant. When indigenous peoples enter the path of forgiveness and intergenerational love, they thrive and make Canada a better country. Parliament must do better to honour the former residential school students. Parliament must do better to honour the children who, rather than playing in playgrounds, were buried by the schools they were forced to be in. If Canada had established a much better relationship and started honouring treaties with indigenous peoples back then, we would have a much better Canada today. Turning to the emergency debate, first, qujannamiik to first responders in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Climate change is accelerating the frequency and size of disasters such as wildfires. Canadians are experiencing unprecedented forest fire seasons, and this season has only just started. Local and provincial first responders and firefighters are already overwhelmed. Manitobans, Saskatchewanians and those in many remote and northern first nations communities are being forced to leave their homes due to raging forest fires. Both provinces have declared states of emergency. To date, about 8,000 people from Saskatchewan, and over 17,000 people from Manitoba, have been evacuated. The federal government's emergency response system is inadequate for addressing the urgent needs of evacuees, particularly those from indigenous communities. The federal government must accelerate its efforts to protect Canadians and lessen the impacts of climate change. Community leaders have expressed concerns about housing space and health care resources for those who have fled the fires. The Government of Canada needs to enact a preventative system that is regionally and community-based, as well as specific and controlled, to stop tragedies before they happen. This particular emergency debate, which I thank the member for Winnipeg Centre for seeking, is of particular importance to Nunavut. Nunavut has a heavy reliance on medical travel, and Winnipeg is a major hub for medical travel patients. Every day, there are medical travel patients going back and forth between Nunavut and Winnipeg. The health care system in Nunavut is very basic. If one goes to the health centre for pain and discomfort, the patient is sent home with pain relief. Sometimes months, and sometimes years, pass with the patient going back and forth without proper care. That same patient often ends up being diagnosed with cancer or a debilitating disease, in places such as Winnipeg, if that patient is lucky enough to get a referral to a clinic there. Communities are served by health centres, where the bulk of care is provided by nurses. Many centres in communities have been forced to remain closed, and only open to emergency cases, because of the lack of available nurses. Some larger communities, such as Iqaluit, have resident doctors. There is only one hospital in Iqaluit. Most communities access the care provided by a visiting doctor or specialist very infrequently. In 2022, the Qanuinngitsiarutiksait study showed that about 16,000 medical appointments went to Manitoba. The study found that approximately 80% of births by women from the Kivalliq region occur in Manitoba, primarily in Winnipeg. They experience one month of confinement, away from their familiar surroundings. The costs of one such birth is approximately $14,000. The federal non-insured health benefits program pays for medical travel, as it is a federal obligation. Unfortunately, the federal government is refusing to meet its obligation. The Government of Nunavut is basically functioning as a bank for the federal government, rather than investing in housing or infrastructure. The federal government is refusing to negotiate in good faith with Nunavut, to the tune of $236 million for the 2025-26 fiscal year. Without timely negotiations and transfers, Nunavummiut will continue to be forced to access health care in places like Winnipeg. While the 17,000 or so people being evacuated to Winnipeg are so important, my constituents must not fall through the cracks as Winnipeg sees a huge influx of people who will, at some point, require health care. I will turn now to the impacts on indigenous peoples experienced by first nations in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The Manitoba premier, Wab Kinew, declared a province-wide state of emergency, announcing that more than 17,000 people are expected to be evacuated from wildfire-affected communities. A recent CBC story said that first nations leaders are pointing out that Manitoba cities are largely booked up as people continue to seek temporary housing for evacuees fleeing communities surrounded by the wildfires. What will the government do to make sure the evacuees are properly housed, fed and able to take care of each other? The federal government's role in wildfire protection with regard to indigenous peoples includes wildfire suppression on federal lands, also known as Indian reserves, or on military bases. We must be given an update as to whether this is occurring. First nations have called on the Government of Canada to uphold its obligations to those who are impacted by wildfires. Indigenous peoples are voicing that their charter rights, particularly section 7, “right to life, liberty and security of the person”, may be engaged if evacuees are exposed to unsafe conditions through inaction. Indigenous Services Canada holds and must exercise a fiduciary obligation to provide supports when federal action is required to protect indigenous peoples and communities. Indigenous Services Canada must ensure that health care services are increased with the increase in the number of people now in Winnipeg. My constituents must not lose their health care, as they were forced to leave Nunavut to receive such services in the first place. Finally, the federal government must respect UNDRIP and ensure that first nations, Inuit and Métis truly provide their free, prior and informed consent with the Liberal government's “one project, one review” system. Canada is already on fire. Expediting mining projects would make all of our lives worse. Those from first nations that have been evacuated cannot provide free, prior and informed consent on projects that may be on their territories, and their rights must not be violated. We implore the Liberal government to ensure that free, prior and informed consent is truly the practice when working with indigenous peoples."
"I feel told off, Madam Deputy Speaker, but thank you very much. I have been told off for talking too long, for talking too short, for going too fast and for going too slow. My point is that we are already committed to creating two working groups that will look at transparency and at technical solutions to the problems that we face. Both of them will have members of the creative industries and members of tech and AI companies engaged in them. In addition, we want to have a separate group of Members of this House and the other House who are engaged with and have an interest in the subject to help us to develop these policy areas. I think it is best to keep those separate, and that is the plan. As we know, the Secretary of State has already written to the Chairs of the relevant Select Committees, but I hope that what I have just said is helpful."
"Mr. Chair, again, we are looking forward. We have seen good development in the LNG sector, and with the one Canadian economy act, we will see even more. We are excited about it. We hope the member will join us."
I call the Chair of the Select Committee.
"Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Mirabel for his presentation. I thought that his focus on the Trojan horse that is one economy out of 13 was interesting. The Liberals claim that they have changed, that they have turned over a new leaf. However, if we look back over the history of governments in the House, whether following the events involving the Patriotes, the world wars, the 1980 referendum, the 1995 referendum or COVID‑19, governments have consistently taken advantage of a crisis to advance their efforts to centralize power and extend their tentacles. Now they have a crisis. Are we once again witnessing a centralizing offensive ultimately designed to pursue the same course as the one steered over the past 10 years? In other words, this government's thinking is much the same as it has always been over the past 10 years, except that now they have an excuse."
"Mr. Speaker, it is not just the energy sector under threat. It is public safety too. While the Prime Minister 's new chief of staff is hell-bent on shutting down oil and gas, he has also brought back David Lametti as principal secretary, the same failed justice minister—"
"Madam Speaker, I do not have the exact stats on how many homes have greater than a 200-amp service, but I suspect there are a lot that do not. I really could not make a stab at that, but the cost to upgrade for those who need to go to 200 amps is atrocious. It is another cost. Once consumers are forced down that pathway, it is not just the cost of the vehicle. It is also the cost they will incur at their home residence. It is terrible."
"Mr. Speaker, I think the member perhaps did not hear what I said, because I said that I actually do support big nation-building projects. However, when we do it wrong, as Stephen Harper did, when we do it wrong, as Bill C-5 would, those projects do not get built. They end up in court. There end up being protests. There end up being blockades, because the Liberals are not doing the hard work to ensure we are doing adequate consultation. That is to say nothing of how undemocratic it is to ram a giant bill like this through with two days at committee and with no parliamentary oversight. For a man who speaks so much in the House of Commons, one would think the member would have some sort of respect for Parliament."
"I am more than happy to tell my hon. Friend. We have breakdowns for every region going to every colleague; there is so much for each part of the UK that I could not possibly do it justice from the Dispatch Box. On his point about clean energy, there is so much money coming into the UK--and more in future--that it would be crazy to turn our backs on that. This is a major economic opportunity, as well as being about a safe, reliable, clean supply of energy for the UK, which is the basis of all economic activity. We can provide that while reducing energy bills for industry, so that is exactly the kind of consistent approach that this country has needed for some time."
"I think we all recognise that events are moving very quickly, but may I ask the Minister about two issues that concern many of us? First, we know that the Qataris were notified, and were able to notify the Americans, of the planned attack on their base. Is the Minister in a position to tell us whether any notification of the escalation of attacks was given to this country? Secondly, can he say a bit more about his plans for the NATO summit and our co-operation with our European counterparts? The events of this week showed very clearly that we need, in Europe, to be able to act strategically to defend our interests, and to work together and step up that work."
The hon. member.
"I do not agree with my hon. Friend's second point. This Bill has been very carefully and narrowly drafted, and I do not think it does the things that she has said it does. As to why the Government would seek to use these powers, I hope she understands that we will do everything we possibly can--as I am sure the previous Government did--to keep the public safe and protect them from high-harm individuals such as extremists, terrorists, and serious and organised criminals, and that this Government, as was the case with the previous Government, consider that this is an appropriate, necessary and proportionate way in which to do that. I hope that the public and the House will understand why we are progressing in the way that we are. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Dr Spencer) made a very thoughtful speech. He has clearly thought about this matter long and hard, and he has done the House a great service with his contribution. I want to reflect briefly on the contribution made by the right hon. Member for North West Hampshire (Kit Malthouse). I enjoy debating these matters with him, and I am genuinely grateful for his contribution. He suggested at one point that he might be an old romantic. I couldn't possibly comment--but I could possibly say that he has advanced some interesting points. They are not points that the Government agree with, and I hope he does not mind me saying that they are not points that the majority of Members of this House agree with, but he has ensured that this debate has been richer than it would otherwise have been had he not made those contributions. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman acknowledges that the Government are acting in good faith in order to ensure that we are best placed to keep the country safe. I know that he is not satisfied with the measures that we have brought forward and does not agree with them. That is absolutely his right. I respect his right to make the case in the way that he has, but I would ask him briefly to consider an alternative scenario in which the Government of the day, regardless of their political party, did not put in place the necessary powers to keep the public safe. One can only imagine the criticism that any Government would face, were they not to do that."
"The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr (Steve Witherden) mentioned the Government's red lines. The Secretary of State for Business and Trade said that there were red lines that would make the Government stop sending F-35 parts, but the Minister has just been clear that it is not possible to stop sending those parts. If the Secretary of State says that there are red lines--and how are we not at those red lines, given what is happening in Gaza--what exactly is going on?"
"Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the member for his speech entirely in French. It was very good. He said that the Liberals had a plan. If there really is a plan, will the government table a budget?"
I call the Minister.
"I rise today to recognize and celebrate an extraordinary achievement by a remarkable young man from my district, Aramis Brown, Jr., a vital member of the Walter H. Dyett High School for the Arts boys' basketball team, the Eagles. This team achieved a historic victory, winning the 2024-2025 Illinois High School Association (IHSA) Class 2A State Championship with a decisive 52-41 win over Althoff Catholic High School on March 15, 2025. This championship is more than just a win on the court. It is a profound testament to the resilience, determination, and unity of the Dyett High School community and the vibrant Bronzeville neighborhood. A decade ago, Dyett faced the threat of closure, but through powerful community advocacy and unwavering commitment, its doors remained open. Today, the Eagles' triumph, in which Aramis Brown, Jr. played a crucial role, symbolizes the incredible potential that flourishes when a community invests in its youth and its institutions. Aramis Brown, Jr., along with his teammates, demonstrated exceptional skill, discipline, and teamwork throughout their season, navigating challenges and competing at the highest level. His hard work and dedication were integral to the team's success, culminating in this well-deserved championship that brings immense pride and joy to his school, family, and the entire community. I also extend my deepest gratitude to Head Coach Jamaal Gill, whose visionary leadership and guidance steered the team to this historic victory, and to Assistant Coaches Kimani Harris, Pierre Adams, and Nathan Townsen, Jr., whose mentorship was vital to the players' development. Aramis Brown, Jr.'s contribution to the Dyett Eagles' journey from near closure to state champions is an inspiring narrative for us all. It underscores the critical importance of supporting our public schools and investing in programs that empower young people to achieve their fullest potential. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Aramis Brown, Jr. and the entire Dyett High School boys' basketball team on their momentous achievement and in honoring them for the inspiration they provide to communities across our Nation."
"The hon. Gentleman has raised a number of important questions. I will certainly look into the issues relating to Surrey that we have discussed previously, and will then come back to him. As for support for children with special educational needs and disabilities, he has made the case for reform very precisely. The current system is simply not working, and the Government are determined to ensure that children get more timely early support and that we have a system that is based much more on need. As part of the process leading to the schools White Paper that will come later in the year, I am engaging with parents, campaigners and others, and I would be more than happy to discuss the matter further with Liberal Democrat colleagues in order to understand their concerns."
"Mr. Speaker, Conservatives are concerned about citizenship and want to make sure crazy things are not implemented into our system. That is why we take the time to look at things. We make sure that we give it proper investigation and bring in the proper experts, and that is what happened. The member mentioned Bill C-71 . That was completely under the control of the government. That had nothing to do with us. The government controlled the agenda. It could have brought it forward. It could have made changes. It could have had that implemented if it chose to. It was not able to control the calendar in a way that made any sense, and it was not able to get it done, just like so many things the Liberal government was unable to get done in the last Parliament. I want to point out that the member, and others from the former party that used to exist in the House, were right beside the Liberals all the way along. They were helping them at every single step. That may be why they are in the position they are in today."
"Mr. Chair, let me help the minister: It is seniors. At what rate do seniors experience chronic homelessness?"
"Many of us have urged this course of action on the Government for some time now, and the imposition of sanctions on these two individuals and others in the Israeli Government is something that is, perhaps, over time. However, I very much welcome the Minister's statement this evening and the hard work that has gone into getting us to this point. I understand the importance of working in concert with our allies, but if the co-operation of our allies is not forthcoming, will the UK Government, given the strength of feeling across the Chamber, unilaterally recognise the state of Palestine?"
"Mr. Chair, that is why the ineligibility requirements in Bill C-2 are there. It is to ensure that we deal with the people who do not have legitimate claims. My—"
"Mr. Chair, it has been an interesting process listening to Conservatives attempt to ask their quippy questions in hopes of preventing a minister from being able to answer. I would suggest more responsible questions. It is interesting that, just last week, every member from the Conservative Party who asked questions tonight actually voted in favour of the ways and means motion. Obviously, if they are voting in favour of it, I think that they would have a general understanding of the estimates and the benefits of going into the estimates, but rather what I heard time and time again was repetition of what the Conservatives had made the decision to debate earlier today. There has been very limited time, as the election was on April 28, and the Conservatives get only three days before the summer break when they can actually designate the issues for debate. I would ask people who are following the debate to listen to what the Conservative agenda really was today, because I think it is an excellent contrast to what the Prime Minister has actually been doing since the last election. When I reflect on April 28 and what I was hearing at the doors, it was nothing to do with what the Conservatives have been talking about this evening with the minister, except maybe when they started to talk about the number of civil servants. We know that there is a Pierre Poilievre, Conservative, right-wing hidden agenda that would cut the public service, in terms of numbers. Beyond that, I cannot really see how it is that they were delving into the estimates, which was the ways and means motion they actually voted in favour of just last week. Instead, they wanted to talk about the whole issue of ArriveCAN and Mr. Firth. It is interesting that the Conservatives were asking whether any money had been collected. A number of members of Parliament, including me, earlier today were talking about that particular issue. In fact, where fraud and overbilling have been clearly demonstrated, GC Strategies is already being pursued in court right now. The Conservatives know that. It sounds like I am talking to a hollow room, as if absolutely no one on the Conservative benches were actually listening, because, quite frankly, the truth hurts, and not one of them has the courage to deny that. They realize that Pierre Poilievre, their leader, has really missed the mark here. Let us do the contrast. We have a Prime Minister who, coming out of the election, is saying that people are concerned about Donald Trump, the tariffs, trade, the economy and jobs. These are issues Canadians are concerned about, yet every member of the Conservative Party who stood up today completely ignored those issues, on a day when they got to designate the debate for the day. They were not content with that and instead tried to ask more questions tonight, many of which had already been previously answered, or they were asking the wrong minister. I find that unfortunate. When the Conservatives are quick to point their finger at this particular new administration, which is what it is, a new Prime Minister and a new administration, they need to reflect on themselves. Mr. Firth was actually receiving government contracts while Stephen Harper was the prime minister, and guess what: The current Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, was a parliamentary secretary to Prime Minister Harper, and at one point he sat around the Harper cabinet table when Mr. Firth and his company were receiving direct grants. However, as they tried to do earlier today, the Conservatives use character assassination and the words “scandal” and “corruption” wherever they can. They would say that Mr. Firth is government-friendly and Liberal-friendly. Was he Conservative-friendly when Mr. Poilievre's government, the government he was a part of, was giving out money? That was what Conservatives wanted to focus on. There are a lot of other things that are happening that I would suggest they should be focusing on. Just the other day, we made an announcement and the minister responsible for the Treasury Board made reference to it in terms of DND. For the first time, we are actually moving in that direction in a very quick fashion, in terms of getting the 2% requirement that NATO has been talking about for a generation. With a new Prime Minister , we have seen a solid commitment toward that. Contrast that with Pierre Poilievre, when he was sitting around that cabinet table. In fact, we will find that the time of Pierre Poilievre was the worst ever. NATO funding was borderline, at just under 1% of GDP. Was that why they did not want to have a healthy discussion on it today, because of his abysmal performance on the whole issue of Canadian Forces? Conservative members then have the temerity to bring up the issue of housing with the President of the Treasury Board . They had the opportunity to do that when the Minister of Housing was here. Instead, they want to duck and deke over here and see if they can score some political points. I do not need to remind members of the Conservative Party how abysmal the Conservative Party was under Stephen Harper and Pierre Poilievre during 2010 and 2014, when I sat in the opposition benches. The minister of housing, Pierre Poilievre, was able to build six homes, although I do not know if they were non-profit. I still have not found out where they were built. They believe that they have the moral high ground on housing, yet they were such failures. As a government, they did nothing on the housing file. For the first time ever, we have a government that not only recognizes the need for the federal government to play a role but is prepared to play a leading role. Modular homes, working with municipalities and the housing accelerator program are the types of programs that are clearly demonstrating that we have a Prime Minister who is committed to the file of housing. When we we talk about the priorities of Canadians, coming out of the election, we can look at the ministerial mandate letters. They are very clear. Building one Canadian economy is what the Prime Minister has been talking about during the election and even now. We continue to push that file, whether it is at the meeting of all the first ministers in Saskatchewan or at the G7 meeting coming up, not to mention all of the other discussions that have been taking place, from a number of different ministers, building to make Canada strong. That is something that we continue to push, because that is what Canadians want us to do. On April 28, we were elected with more votes than any other prime minister or political party has ever received in the history of Canada. That demonstrates action. That is what we as a government have been working on and have been focused on. We continue to look at ways to improve the system. When we go into the estimates process, I really respect the fact that the opposition members can ask questions about whatever it is that they want, but this is just a continuation of what I would suggest is Pierre Poilievre's misdirection. Conservatives have two leaders. They have one for the House. I do not quite understand why they cannot reflect on the election and go with those focused priorities. The priorities are in the mandate letters, which talk about tax breaks, border controls and building one strong Canadian economy. If I were to ask one question of the minister responsible for this evening, it would be to ask him to provide his thoughts on the mandate letter, a mandate letter that is the same within all of the departments. Every minister was given the same mandate letter. Why is this? It it because we have a new Prime Minister with a new administration that is focused on making Canada the strongest country in the G7. We are responding to what Canadians were telling us at the last federal election, and that is what I look forward to continuing over the coming months, and hopefully years, under this new administration. If the minister wants to provide his thoughts and, if there is still time, I would be interested in him commenting on the mandate letters."
"Mr. Chair, it sounds a lot like the same old government with the same non-answers and no accountability. Has the government taken any action, any steps against GC Strategies to recover millions of taxpayer dollars for work that was not done, anything?"
"In my constituency of Mid Dunbartonshire, the community justice team are having some success in preventing reoffending by working with offenders in a trauma-informed way. Given the success of that trauma-informed approach to rehabilitation, what discussions has the Minister had regarding the differing approaches that are taken to offender rehabilitation across the UK?"
"I thank my hon. Friend for her question and for the effort she put in to travel to the area and to meet those in Israel and beyond. To be clear, the sanctions announced are not sanctions on the two Ministries that the men represent. They are sanctions on the men themselves and the extremist rhetoric that they are responsible for. We would keep further sanctions under review on individuals who conducted rhetoric of that kind."
"I rise today to wish a very happy retirement to an excellent Marylander whom I am proud to represent in the Fifth District: Karen Reid. She is retiring after 23 years of distinguished service here in the House. Karen started working in the House Office Supply Service and House Gift Shop in 2002 as a Supply Account Specialist. Much has changed over the past 23 years. When she started on the Hill, Dennis Hastert was Speaker and President George W. Bush had just started his first term in office. As Karen can attest, given her long commute to work every day, gas was just $1.36 a gallon. Karen's professionalism, character, and joyful personality, however, have remained the same. From her start in the 107th Congress to the end of her tenure in the 119th Congress, she has excelled in her accounting role. In these 12 Congresses, Karen has set up and taken down multiple Member and Committee charge accounts seamlessly so that we can perform our Congressional duties to the best of our ability. Karen has played a vital role in our organization and has always been a joy to work with. Her coworkers tell me that her desk is adorned with mementos and photos of her children and grandchildren, whom she is so proud of and loves so dearly. I am also told that she is quite fond of all things `frog related,' and her desk reflects that passion as well. It is now 2025, and after nearly a quarter of a century serving this great institution, Karen is ready to start a well-deserved, commute- free, and hopefully frog-filled retirement. We have been so fortunate to have her serving the House for all these years. We will miss Karen, but we wish her happiness and relaxation in her retirement. I ask all my colleagues to join me in congratulating her."
The hon. member.
"Mr. Speaker, that is another good question. Indeed, it was not an obsession. It is an obligation. However, these things take time. Balancing a budget cannot and should not happen overnight. We are not going to do that in the midst of an economic crisis or trade war. We will take the time to get it right."
"it was over 20 years ago that our office was contacted in Chicago. It was a young woman named Tereza Lee. She had been born in Korea and as an infant was taken to Brazil. And then her father, who was a Protestant minister, brought her and her mother to Chicago. She contacted our office because she had a problem when it came to her citizenship. It seems that the decision to move her around as an infant, made by her parents, left her undocumented. Her family didn't have a lot of money. She grew up with her father who was a Protestant minister, trying to find the proper church. And she went from church to church as her father preached sermons and made a few dollars to keep the family together. While her father was practicing his sermons at the church, she was in the back room banging away at the piano. As a student in public schools in Chicago, she got her first opportunity for real lessons through something called the Merit Music Program. She was great--extraordinary. By the time she finished high school, people recognized in her an extraordinary musical genius. They encouraged her to apply to the best--Juilliard and Manhattan Conservatory of Music. As she filled out the application to go to these great schools, she would run across that question: What is your nationality? What is your citizenship? She never thought to ask. Turns out she was undocumented. She didn't know what that meant in terms of her future, and a friend of hers contacted our office to see what we could do. The law is very clear for Tereza Lee. Although it was her parents and others who made decisions in her life that resulted in an undocumented status, the law of the United States said that she had to leave the United States for 10 years and apply to come back in. Didn't sound right to me. She didn't make any of those decisions; her parents did. She had done everything she was supposed to do: go to school, get good grades, develop her talent. And yet, we were rejecting her and sending her out of the country. It is at that point that I introduced a bill called the DREAM Act. If you talked about Dreamers before that bill was introduced, most people would refer you to the British rock group Freddie and the Dreamers, which very few people remember. But since then, the word ``Dreamers'' has come to characterize these young people who, by decisions of their parents, are in the United States undocumented. Today, we mark the 13th anniversary of the program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA. It is a program which affects these Dreamers and their future. I first introduced the DREAM Act with Republican Senator Orrin Hatch in 2001--24 years ago. I have included it in many forms of legislation that comes to the Senate floor, repeatedly introduced it as an amendment over the years. I have never quite been able to reach the point where I can meet the 60-vote requirement to waive the filibuster or to pass it in the House the same year. After years of congressional action, in 2010, I wrote a letter to a man who is my former colleague from Illinois who had been elected President of theUnited States, Barrack Obama. And I asked him--and Senator Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, joined me in asking President Obama if he could do something to stop the deportation of these young Dreamers. Two years later, President Obama announced the DACA Program. The DACA Program has protected nearly 835,000 Dreamers, many of whom who have gone on to pursue higher education, purchase homes, start businesses, and make America a better country to live in. These young people who grew up in this country alongside my own kids, went to school, stood up in the morning before class and pledged allegiance to that flag and believed that they were real Americans from the start--but not in the eyes of the law. DACA recipients have started families; 37 percent have U.S. citizen children; and 935,000 U.S. citizens live with DACA holders. It is a large chunk of our population, and they have done dramatic things to make this a better country. DACA recipients greatly contribute to our labor force. They are teachers, nurses, workers, doctors, and more. They boost our economy, providing nearly $16 billion to the U.S. economy each year. I have been coming to the Senate floor for 20 years telling the stories of Dreamers and DACA recipients. I don't think there is any better way to describe who they are and what they go through to try to become American citizens and be part of the future of this country. I would like to highlight one of them today. This is the 149th story of a Dreamer that I have shared on the floor of the Senate. Alondra O. was born in Mexico and moved to the St. Louis metropolitan area when she was 5 years old. She was a great student. She became a member of the National Honor Society. She was certified as a nurse assistant, a patient care technician, and phlebotomist all by the time she graduated from high school. Her dream was to become a full-time registered nurse. Do we need more nurses? Absolutely. Despite the national nursing shortage and her excellent qualifications, Alondra was unable to get a nursing license in her home State of Missouri because State law there prohibits DACA recipients from becoming nurses. But she didn't give up. Missouri's loss became my home State of Illinois's gain. And today, Alondra serves as an emergency department registered nurse in Alton, IL, just across the river from Missouri. Sadly, Alondra still lives in fear today every day that all of her hard work would mean nothing if DACA is eliminated. She has lived in this country since she was 5 years old. She should not be forced to leave the only home she has ever known simply because Congress has failed to do its job to fix our broken immigration system. Alondra should be able to work in this critical field where we desperately need nurses, wherever her services are most needed, and do so without fear of deportation. I have heard a lot said in political campaigns about murderers, rapists, terrorists, and mentally deranged people who were seeking to make a future in the United States. What about Alondra? Does she fit any of those categories? Of course not. She, against the odds, built a great reputation and a great resume, with her education, training, and work experience. She is doing work in her field in a part of our State where we desperately need nurses. She is no threat to anyone. She is not a danger. She is, in fact, a beacon of hope for those people who are sick and need a good nurse. Unfortunately, there has been a relentless campaign to eliminate DACA and deport Dreamers, so the future for Alondra and other DACA recipients remains legally uncertain. Basic question: Is America better off to have Alondra the nurse in Alton, IL, here or to deport her from the United States to a country she hasn't seen since she was 5 years old? More than 100,000 Dreamers have initial DACA applications that are still pending. They are in limbo because for years we haven't allowed those who qualified to apply to join the ranks of DACA. DACA was always intended to be a temporary program to give Congress time to pass a permanent solution. We are not very good at passing anything in Congress. Now in their 13th year, it is time for us to honor the Dreamers' patience, act on our promises, and provide them with a pathway to citizenship. My mother was an immigrant to this country. I am proud of immigrants. Our family came here with nothing, not even speaking the language, worked hard, and established themselves. My mother--eighth grade education, no experience in high school or college--raised three boys to serve this country. My two brothers were in the U.S. Navy, and I serve here in the U.S. Senate. Is immigration important for this country? The Durbin family believes that it is. I am going to continue to fight for the Dreamers, continue to fight for DACA. I urge my Republican colleagues, be thoughtful on the issue of immigration. Don't penalize Alondra, this wonderful young woman who has worked so hard to become a registered nurse in my State of Illinois. Give her a chance to make America and my State a better place. We remember this anniversary of the DACA Program and thank President Obama for his vision to realize these young people could make this a better country and realize we have to be thoughtful when it comes to immigration. If you are a danger to this country, we don't want you here, we don't want you coming here, but if you are going to make this a better place to live, we not only want you, we desperately need you. The DACA Program represents hundreds of thousands of young people who prove that every single day of their lives. I yield the floor."
"The hon. Member makes an important point about people's lived experience of these types of policy announcements. We are trying to make it easier for people to use affordable, reliable public transport that is better for the environment and easier for them to use to get about in their day-to-day lives. We have seen that a lot in places such as London in the past, other places around the country have looked on in envy. The announcement today will mean that that is available to many people across the country. Announcements on funding for areas that do not have combined authority mayors will also come, but that will be next week at the spending review."
The hon. member for Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman is correct. I would ask the member not to use proper names. The hon. Secretary of State.
"I welcome the Minister's statement. This announcement will mean that over half a million more Londoners will benefit from a PS150 discount on their energy bills this winter. Does she agree that along with our free breakfast clubs, the PS1,400 per year increase in the minimum wage and free childcare in schools, today's announcement shows that Labour is putting money back into the pockets of working people in Ealing Southall and across the country?"
"Mr. Chair, is the over $800 million for the interim federal health program sustainable, yes or no?"
"I am sorry to see my colleague Senator Tillis leave before I have a chance to tell him how much I am going to miss him. We have worked together on a number of things, including the Senate NATO Observer Group. He has been a great partner, an excellent Senator, and I am sorry to hear that he is not going to be staying in this body. But, Mr. President, I am really here on this floor to oppose the reconciliation bill that we are considering today. It would be the largest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in a single bill in our history. This legislation would take away healthcare for millions of Americans; it would cut food aid for millions more; it would raise household energy and healthcare bills; and it would add trillions to the debt, all to give the top, not just 1 percent but the top 0.1 percent of people who make more than $2.5 million a year an extra $250,000 a year. At a moment when Americans are struggling with the high cost of living, this bill will take money out of the pockets of working people, the average household making less than $50,000. That is 30 percent of Americans. So 30 percent of Americans will lose about $700 a year from this bill. Here are some of the ways that it hurts middle-class Americans, the people whom I am very proud to represent in New Hampshire: Somehow, the Senate took the bad bill--or what I thought was a bad bill--from the House, and they have made it much, much worse. This bill is the largest cut to healthcare in American history. In total, the bill proposes more than $1 trillion--$1 trillion--in cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act--$930 billion of that is Medicaid alone. Because of these cuts, more than 300 ruralhospitals could close, more than 500 nursing homes could close. These are core programs and services that benefit seniors, children, veterans, people living with disabilities, and working families. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 17 million Americans, including 43,000 Granite Staters, would lose their health insurance. Over the past several weeks, the past couple of months, I have toured New Hampshire. I have heard from countless constituents who are deeply anxious about what this bill means for them and for their families. Again and again, they have said plainly, without Medicaid, without the Affordable Care Act, they would not be here today. I heard from Danielle in Dalton, northern New Hampshire. Danielle is a proud mother of three sons, two of whom have autism. Danielle's sons rely on Medicaid for their health coverage and for their home care. Danielle is not only their full-time caregiver; she receives a stipend from Medicaid to provide for their care. And thanks to Medicaid, both of her sons are able to work part-time, they are able to live at home with their mom, and they are able to remain active in the community. This bill would put all of that at risk. Danielle says her sons could have difficulty qualifying for Medicaid under these new rules, and losing Medicaid would be catastrophic for her family because it would likely force her sons out of work, out of her home, and into a group home or institution. So it is going to cost a lot more if that happens. Her boys are now contributing members of society, and this bill threatens not only their livelihood and their independence and their future, it threatens their dignity. I heard from Shawn in Claremont. Shawn shared with me his story of addiction to alcohol, cocaine, and heroin and his long road to recovery. After several near-death experiences, he found stability in a sober living home and enrolled in Medicaid. With access to treatment, he was able to hold a job and get his life back on track. He eventually opened his own sober living home, Hope 2 Freedom, where he now helps others suffering from addiction so that they can enroll in Medicaid and begin their own journey to sobriety. I heard from Karla in Exeter. Karla has twin 3-year-old boys, one of whom had serious medical complications at birth. Now, she always was able to have health insurance with her job, but as her family's medical bills piled up, she enrolled her son in Medicaid to ensure that he got the care that her family could not afford and her employer-sponsored health insurance wouldn't pay for. He still needs extensive care to this day, and losing her coverage would put her family into devastating medical debt. Probably the story I heard that touched me as much as any was from a man in Berlin, in northern New Hampshire. He had had a number of substance misuse issues, mental health challenges. He said: Without Medicaid, without the center--we were at a center where Medicaid helped pay to support people who needed help. He said: Without this, I would just give up; I would commit suicide because there would be nothing for me. These are just a handful of the countless stories I have heard these past few months. They are about real people. This bill isn't just words on a page; it is a direct attack on not only their health and their economic security but their very dignity, their ability to have fulfilling lives and to contribute back to their communities and to society. We owe them better than this. This bill would also make catastrophic cuts to food assistance that is provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. During this time of high food prices, of increasing food insecurity, it is particularly critical for families to be able to rely on SNAP to help them keep food on the table. One of the ways this bill cuts the program is by requiring States to pay higher costs. Now, as the former Governor of New Hampshire, I can tell you how much of a burden this is on our State's budget. And there are all kinds of provisions in this bill that are nothing but massive cost shifts to States, and this is one area. The bill puts food assistance at risk for families with teenage children as well as older adults, veterans, and individuals experiencing homelessness. In New Hampshire, an estimated 1,000 older adults could lose SNAP access. These cuts will mean increased hunger across the country. You know, we talk a lot about kitchen table issues here. Passing this bill is an explicit vote to take food off of families' kitchen tables. I heard from Rachel. She is a care coordinator at a behavioral health center in Claremont, which is in the western part of New Hampshire. She told me:  SNAP is not just a program--it is a lifeline. For the parents I work with, it means being able to send their children to school with full stomachs and functioning minds. For caregivers struggling to make ends meet, it provides some peace of mind knowing there will be something on the table each night. And for children--many of whom are navigating mental health challenges--SNAP supports stability, dignity and health during formative years. Without SNAP, the strain on these already vulnerable families would increase exponentially.  She goes on to say:  SNAP is not a handout--it is a step forward for families working hard to survive and succeed against overwhelming odds.  On the energy front, for families concerned about energy costs, this bill only offers more pain. In addition to cutting off tremendously successful incentives for electricity that are adding reliable, affordable, and clean energy to the grid at a record pace, this bill cuts off longstanding tax credits for consumers--for average, everyday Americans--to make energy-saving improvements to their homes or to add rooftop solar to take control of their own energy bills. After countless promises to lower people's energy bills, this legislation would do just the opposite. Last year, 2.3 million families took advantage of the home energy efficiency tax credit and cut an average $130 off of their yearly energy bills. Now, this may not sound like a lot to the Mar-a-Lago crowd, but it makes a big difference for families in New Hampshire who worry about how they are going to heat their homes. American households are expected to pay an extra $170 billion in energy bills over the next 10 years, thanks to the misplaced priorities in this bill. Add to that 1.5 million good jobs that are likely to go away, and it makes you wonder if supporters of this bill have actually read it or if they actually care about American energy dominance. And on taxes, this bill spends more than $4 trillion on tax cuts, including nearly $1 trillion in new tax breaks for the biggest corporations. But for taxpayers earning less than $30,000 a year, they would see an average tax increase. Let me say that again because I didn't say that quite right with the right emphasis: For taxpayers earning less than $30,000 a year, they would see an average tax increase in 2029. And these are the same families who are going to be harmed most by extreme cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. Families making under $50,000 are likely to be worse off, and some could lose more than $1,500 a year under this bill. So if you add to that the effects of Trump's tariffs, which raise the cost of living for a typical family by $2,000 a year, this makes it even worse for families. So the bottom 80 percent of households, those making less than $175,000, will be worse off, on average, under this bill.  Now, I have talked about how this bill makes families pay more for healthcare, for energy, and food in order to give more money to billionaires, but there are a few other things that people should know. First, because of the trillions of dollars this bill would add to the debt, interest rates are likely to go up. That adds more than $1,000 a year for a typical mortgage. This bill makes it harder for students to afford the cost of college, and it removes debt protections for students who have been defrauded by their schools. And this bill actually tries to prohibit States from regulating AI for the next 10 years, making it that much harder to keep our kids safe online and to protect jobs from being lost to the use of this technology. You know, I was first elected to the New Hampshire State Senate morethan 30 years ago. This bill that we are considering today would do more harm to more people than any other law I have seen in my entire time in public office. This bill makes having a family more expensive by raising the cost of energy, healthcare, and education. This bill takes food and healthcare away from seniors and families, and it does all of that--it does all of that--to give trillions of dollars more to corporations and to the wealthiest. And it explodes our deficit in the process. That is not what the people of New Hampshire are asking for, and it is not what Americans deserve. So, to my colleagues in the Senate, I say this: At a moment when Americans are feeling squeezed by the cost of living, we should be doing something about that. Instead of gutting healthcare to pay for tax cuts, we should be expanding access to affordable, quality care. Instead of turning our backs on working parents, we should be making housing more affordable. And we should ensure that every child has access to high quality, affordable early education. Instead of cutting nutrition programs, let's make sure that no child in America goes hungry. Instead of driving up food and energy prices, let's invest in the programs that help American families succeed. President Trump calls this the Big Beautiful Bill, but it is a big betrayal of the American people. There is nothing beautiful about taking away healthcare and food from working families to give more money to billionaires. So I intend to vote against this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor."
"Mr. Speaker, when someone submits a receipt and gets paid for work that they did not do, which is exactly what GC Strategies did, it is called fraud. That is what happened under the government's watch: $20 million for the arrive scam and millions more on non-arrive scam contracts. It is scandalous. It is criminal."
"Mr. Speaker, diversifying our trade has been the goal of the current Liberal government, but an article posted last night by The Economist states that the United States will be granted first right of refusal on Canadian minerals. Before going to Washington, Mr. Carney asked officials to list the Canadian products that Mr. Trump needs the most. Rare earth elements and critical minerals topped that list. It looks like the Liberals want to give first right of refusal on our critical minerals, limiting our ability to sell to the world and to diversify our economy. Is the Prime Minister negotiating guaranteed access to Canada's minerals to United States—"
"Mr. Speaker, farmers in Souris—Moose Mountain and across the prairies are being crushed by crippling 100% tariffs on canola. The Liberal government has done nothing. These unjust tariffs are jeopardizing family farms, threatening livelihoods and undermining the backbone of our agricultural economy. While producers urgently seek leadership and support, the Liberals remain silent. When will the Liberals take real, concrete action to eliminate these punitive tariffs on Canadian canola and, for once, stand up for Canadian farmers?"
"My thoughts, and I am sure those of the entire House, are with those who have been affected by the tragic plane crash in India this morning. We know that British nationals were on board. I can confirm, Mr Speaker, that the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office is working urgently with local authorities to support British nationals and their families, and has stood up a crisis team in both Delhi and London. With permission, Mr Speaker, I will now make a statement on Gibraltar. Yesterday, the United Kingdom reached a political agreement with the European Union on the last major unresolved issue from our decision to leave the EU, providing much-needed certainty for people and businesses in Gibraltar. The deal removes another obstacle to closer ties with our EU friends and, crucially, protects British sovereignty over the Rock. The need for this deal is well understood. As Members across the House have often highlighted, the current situation is not sustainable. Every single day, approximately 15,000 people--half of Gibraltar's workforce--cross the land border with Spain to do their jobs, and to buy goods and services. Without a solution, the EU's incoming system of entry and exit controls would have introduced a hard border, at which every individual's passport would be checked, and all British goods heading for Gibraltar's supermarket shelves would be subject to time-consuming customs checks. That would cause chaos and backlogs, endanger the livelihoods of British citizens in Gibraltar, wreck the territory's economy and possibly cost it hundreds of millions of pounds a year, and place pressure, ultimately, on the UK taxpayer to pick up the bill. All my predecessors since the referendum have had to wrestle with the looming threat to Gibraltar's economy and way of life. These issues were, regrettably, left out of the EU exit negotiations. The previous Government began further talks to address them in 2021, when the former right hon. Member for Esher and Walton was Foreign Secretary. The issues were taken forward by the right hon. Member for Braintree (Sir James Cleverly), and the noble Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton came close to reaching an agreement. I pay tribute to their efforts, and to them for briefing me on Privy Council terms when I was in opposition. It fell to this Government, when we came into office last year, to get a deal over the line, and it was imperative that we did. Gibraltar is part of the British family. Its people are British citizens. Its military facilities are of the utmost importance to Britain's security, protecting important global trade routes in volatile geopolitical times. Britain is safer thanks to the work of our armed forces on the Rock. Since coming into office, therefore, we have made it a priority to negotiate a lasting solution with the European Commission and Spain. I acknowledge the role of the Minister for Europe, North America and the Overseas Territories, who, in opposition and government, has been a relentless advocate for the people of Gibraltar, and has been integral to finding a mutually beneficial way forward. I also thank the Minister for the Armed Forces, as well as the dedicated team of Foreign Office diplomats for all their  efforts, led by Lindsay Appleby in Brussels and Robbie Bulloch in London; their negotiating skill and deft diplomacy have been in the finest tradition of our diplomatic service. British Ministers and officials have worked hand in glove with the Government of Gibraltar to conclude these tricky negotiations. Chief Minister Fabian Picardo has been at the table at every single stage of the process. Yesterday, he welcomed me to Gibraltar before we travelled together to Brussels to conclude the talks--as he said, as ""a united British family"". This Government would never agree to any solution that did not have the full support of the Government of Gibraltar--nothing about Gibraltar without Gibraltar. The Chief Minister has said that what we have agreed is ""something remarkable...Something bold. Something forward-looking and hopeful."" I pay tribute to all those whose tireless efforts have helped to get us here. We have protected Gibraltar's sovereignty, economy and way of life for the long term. Since 2021, this and previous Governments have been involved in 19 formal rounds of talks and countless technical discussions, sherpa meetings and ministerial calls--it was a massive collective effort--to ensure that Gibraltar could continue to prosper. We have agreed a unique and practical solution to the problem facing Gibraltar, the only British overseas territory that shares a border with the EU's visa-free Schengen area. Its people's livelihoods depend on a fluid border. Our solution will deliver jobs, investment and stability, not just for Gibraltar, but for the entire region. British sovereignty over the whole of Gibraltar, including British Gibraltar territorial waters, remains sacrosanct and iron-clad. On starting talks, I immediately secured an agreement to add a clause explicitly protecting our sovereignty, and the same goes for British Forces Gibraltar, which will continue to operate without interference or interruption, exactly as it does today. Traffic at the border between Gibraltar and Spain will be able to flow, without checks on the people crossing. Residents of Gibraltar and of nearby Spanish communities will be able to go about their daily life, as they have done. For those arriving by air at Gibraltar's airport, there will be dual border control checks--a model similar to the one whereby French police operate in London's St Pancras station. Ignore the fake news: Gibraltar will not be joining Schengen. That was never on the table. Immigration, policing and justice in Gibraltar will remain the responsibility of Gibraltar's authorities. As for products entering Gibraltar across its land border, there will be a unique goods and customs model, avoiding the need for onerous checks at the border. With this pragmatic solution, flights will be able to operate from Gibraltar airport across Europe, driving growth and jobs for the people of Gibraltar. This Government are showing that a pragmatic, positive relationship with the European Union pays off for the British public. Just as at the UK-EU summit last month, we are solving the problems left by the previous Government and their thin Brexit deal, and are making working people across the British family safer and better off. We can now also strengthen our co-operation with Spain, our NATO ally, a place that British people know so well. I am grateful to my counterparts in Spain and the EU for completing these negotiations in good faith, in the spirit of win-win solutions for all parties involved. This agreement paves the way for finalisation of the UK-EU treaty text on Gibraltar. All parties have committed to completing this as quickly as possible. I can reassure hon. Members that the House will have the opportunity to scrutinise it in the usual way. I hope that Members from all parts of the House take this matter with the seriousness that it deserves and back the solution that Gibraltar's Chief Minister and I have come to, guaranteeing Gibraltar's sovereignty, economy and way of life. This is what competent government looks like: fixing problems, not creating them; standing up for our overseas territories, not leaving them exposed; and protecting Britain's interests abroad, to ensure security and growth at home. With this agreement, Gibraltar will have easier access to the European economy. Its businesses can plan for the long-term once again, and its citizens can feel reassured about their future. Britain's commitment to Gibraltar remains as solid as the Rock itself. I commend this statement to the House."

We will continue to assess how we can best support those in need."

"As I replied to my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Dame Meg Hillier), conversations continue between Members of this House and the Defence Secretary. He is open to further conversations to try to find a way forward, and I am certain that he would welcome a conversation with the hon. Gentleman."
"I thank the hon. Lady for raising this issue. It has been raised with me on a number of occasions by the right hon. Member for Dumfriesshire,  Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell) as well. No one should be left without a signal, and that is what should be happening, but I will ensure that the hon. Lady and other Members are kept updated, because this is an urgent matter."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 2808, the Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act, and I commend Representatives Rose and Torres for introducing it. I thank the sponsors for their good work on this bipartisan bill, and I appreciate that the House is taking action to improve data privacy, in this case with respect to the mortgage market. First, let's discuss, as I think the gentleman has, what a trigger lead is. You go to a particular lender or mortgage broker, and you apply for a mortgage. You want to deal with that mortgage broker or that financial institution. If you wanted to deal with others,you would go elsewhere. If you wanted to deal with several, you would call several. When you seek a mortgage loan, of course the mortgage lender has to look at your credit report, so they call Equifax or whoever or email Equifax and get your credit report. Then the credit bureau sells that information--which you don't want divulged and which the lender doesn't want divulged--to other financial institutions without your permission, creating a so-called trigger lead. Then, as was pointed out, you become bombarded with phone calls, text messages, and other communications from rival mortgage loan officers. They may even give you misleading or deceptive information. H.R. 2808 would curtail this abusive practice, limiting trigger lead notifications to a financial firm that a consumer already has a relationship with, like their current mortgage lender. If the consumer opts in, and you can opt in, then you can have everybody call you. Now, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the good work of our former colleague Representative Lacy Clay who helped pave the path by first introducing a bill to curb abusive trigger leads clear back in 2020. Representative Clay's original bill didn't have any exceptions at all and simply required that a consumer opt in, and if the consumer chose not to opt in, their information could not be shared with other companies when they applied for a mortgage loan. Consumer opt-in is an approach that data privacy advocates prefer and one that committee Democrats argued for last Congress when the committee considered former Chair McHenry's version of this bill. We should put consumers first, put them in the driver's seat to control the use, sharing, and selling of their data. This bill gets us almost all the way there. It does provide exceptions for those financial institutions that you already have a relationship with. We are not debating consumer privacy in a vacuum. It is unfortunate that Elon Musk and his DOGE minions have had access to data on hundreds of millions of Americans. I wish we were here on the floor preventing Mr. Musk from getting our personal health records, our consumer data, our business records, our Social Security numbers, and our tax data. After we pass this bill, I hope that the Financial Services Committee would investigate what has happened to consumer protection and what has happened to data privacy, particularly with regard to data obtained from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Treasury Department. Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important step toward protecting consumers from abuse, making sure that the fact that they applied for a mortgage with one mortgage company isn't sold against their will to every other mortgage company in the country. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time."
"I am very happy to thank Dr Cameron and the whole team. As ever, with his vast experience of the health service, my hon. Friend makes an excellent point. We are reliant on clinical and managerial staff to make the system better. I know, and he knows, how low morale has been; Lord Darzi made that point very clear, and we cannot over-estimate how difficult that is for staff. That is why we have reached two record inflation-beating pay settlements for staff, and importantly, we have supported the independent process, because we want to work with staff to make things better at all levels. My hon. Friend gives an excellent example of how, by working with excellent clinical leadership and excellent managers, we can bring the best of the NHS to the rest of the NHS."
"Madam Speaker, just because there is a new leader, it does not mean there is a new government. It is the same ministers sitting around the table, who caused the last 10 years of pain and misery for Canadians, who doubled the cost of housing, who made food prices go up and who made crime out of control in this country. The policies have not changed. The cabinet table has not changed, and neither will these Liberals. They are going to continue to make promises they can never deliver on, and that is why Canadians need a change now. We need to get this country back on track. If the Liberals keep following their failed broken record, Canadians will never have it any better."
"Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise on behalf of the people of Kamloops—Thompson—Nicola. Before I begin, I want to recognize a new person in Kamloops, a new cousin. His name is Harry Smith, born to Lewis Smith and my cousin Claudia Wright. I welcome Harry to the world. It is a pleasure to have him as one of our newest members in Kamloops. My hon. colleague spoke about first nations and consultation. I took over part of his riding through redistribution. We now have 27 first nations in Kamloops—Thompson—Nicola. I wonder if, given his knowledge of the area, the member could expand on the comments he made earlier respecting first nations."
"In my constituency, Hammersmith bridge has been closed to vehicles for over six years. During that time, buses have been unable to cross, emergency vehicles have experienced delays and businesses on both sides of the bridge have lost out. The Economic Secretary to the Treasury was recently unable to confirm on the radio whether the structures fund will be put towards the bridge's repairs, so will the Minister tell me whether we can expect funding for Hammersmith bridge to reopen?"

We recognise the competitive pressures that the US trade deal will bring--it is obviously not yet in operation--and have met the companies affected and continue to negotiate with them. They are already very distressed and lose significant amounts of money, so what they really need are regulatory changes from the Department for Transport for the market as a whole. I can assure him that we are working on that."

I agree wholeheartedly. It is very important that substance abuse is properly tackled. Probation services and youth offending teams do a lot of work in that space.
"I rise today to honor the amazing life of Sallye Ruth Moore, a trailblazer in education, a fierce advocate for equity, a beloved daughter of Grand Prairie, and a pillar of the community in Dalworth on San Antonio Street. Ms. Moore passed away this year at 91. She leaves behind a major legacy of education in the north Texas community. For over four decades, she devoted her life to uplifting students and breaking barriers, becoming the associate superintendent in the Grand Prairie ISD. Her journey began as a teacher, counselor, and principal, where she received numerous accolades for her excellence in the classroom and for shaping and forming students for generations. Ms. Moore's leadership wasn't just about academics. It was about dignity, discipline, and love. She was just an amazing person. A school was named after her, Sallye Moore Elementary, in the Dalworth community in Grand Prairie in 2001. Her legacy will live on for a very long time. She leaves behind a son, Greg. If she looks familiar, it is because she was the last remaining sibling out of the four Johnson kids. Eddie Bernice Johnson, our former colleague, was her sister. We remember Ms. Moore today as a servant leader, a giant in Texas education, and a beacon of hope. May her memory be a blessing, and may we all strive to follow her excellent example."

"Let me begin by laying my cards on the table. I am, of course, a liberal and have always supported the right of individuals to choose freely when they want to end their life. I have no religious or philosophical objection to assisted dying, and when the debate on the Bill began, I assumed I would vote in favour of it. However, as the debate in this Chamber on Second Reading progressed, and in particular as a result of the compelling speeches by the hon. Members for Vauxhall and Camberwell Green (Florence Eshalomi) and for City of Durham (Mary Kelly Foy), and in particular from the Mother of the House, the right hon. Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), I came to the reluctant decision that the state of palliative care in this country and the safeguards against coercion in all its forms were not sufficient to vote in favour of the Bill. Despite the changes in Committee, my mind has not changed. I will again be voting against the Bill. However, let me be equally clear that amendments 103 and 104, in my name and to which I will now speak, are not wrecking amendments, but critical to ensuring proper parliamentary scrutiny if the Bill becomes law."
"Mr. Chair, [ Technical difficulty—Editor ]."
"I thank the hon. Member for raising that point. It is important that those in need of healthcare, in particular, receive support. It is not that we see higher levels of challenge in keeping the heating on among older generations; it is about the consequences of that, particularly in cases such as the one she raises. That is exactly why we need to ensure that we are turning around the NHS, which all the constituents of hon. Members in England are relying on. We are seeing improvements to waiting times in Wales as well."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S. 331, the HALT Fentanyl Act. The House approved this bill in February, and since that time, the Trump administration has set its sights on dismantling our Nation's public health infrastructure, including the agency directly responsible for addressing mental health and substance abuse disorders. Republicans are going to claim today that they are addressing the opioid overdose crisis with this bill, but this is nothing but a distraction from the fact that Republicans continue to silently stand by and allow the Trump administration to gut our public health agencies. Republicans are also attempting to distract from the fact that last month they passed the largest cuts to healthcare in American history as part of their big, ugly bill. Republicans are stripping healthcare away from 16 million Americans so they can give giant tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations, two groups that don't need any help right now. Now, Mr. Speaker, over the last couple of years, we have made significant progress in addressing the opioid overdose crisis. Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced a 24 percent decline in drug overdose deaths for the 12 months ending in September of 2024, compared to the previous year. This is encouraging news, but I am deeply concerned that the Trump administration's attacks on public health, coupled with the Republicans' attacks on Americans' healthcare will seriously threaten the improvements we have made. The bill before us today permanently schedules fentanyl-related substances on schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. This is based on a class definition disputed by scientists. I oppose this bill because it is a permanent extension instead of a temporary one that we agreed on for 2 years in the end-of-the-year appropriations package. Now, that bipartisan package was pushed aside by Speaker Johnson after Elon Musk voiced his opposition to the overall package. The temporary option would have left the door open for an off-ramp to substances found to have potential medical applications. However, this Republican bill would also exacerbate inequities in our criminal justice system because drugs placed on schedule I include mandatory minimum sentencing. S. 331 also does not provide additional resources for prevention, treatment, recovery, or harm reduction. So this bill is essentially recycling an incarceration first response to what I consider mainly a public health challenge. That is because Republicans don't want to talk about this as a public health challenge. Instead, President Trump and House Republicans want to focus on piecemeal policies in the hopes it will distract from their efforts to gut Medicaid and drug treatment programs. Now Republicans are sabotaging Medicaid, which will be devastating to people who struggle with mental health and substance use issues. Medicaid is the single largest payer in the country for behavioral health services, covering 40 percent of all Americans with opioid use disorder. Americans with substance use and mental health issues will face new barriers and red tape in signing up for and staying enrolled in their health insurance. House Republicans are setting up new barriers and roadblocks to care that will, unfortunately, result in our mental health and substance abuse crises only worsening. Republicans are silently standing by as the Trump administration is moving forward with an unauthorized and illegal plan to eliminate the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, better known as SAMHSA. SAMHSA is the very agency responsible for preventing substance use disorder, increasing access to treatment, and promoting recovery. It will be combined with other agencies that the Trump administration doesn't care about under the banner of a larger make America healthy again office. Now, these critical programs to treat mental health and substance abuse will be deprioritized or eliminated in favor of Secretary RFK, Jr.'s, pet projects, like destroying Americans' access to vaccines. He is going to prioritize that, and not SAMHSA and substance abuse treatment. Congress has received zero information from the Trump administration about how this new office will work and how the work of SAMHSA to address the mental health and substance use treatment needs of our community will be prioritized. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Nation's leading mental health and substance use treatment organizations. It is called the Mental Health Liaison Group.  MHLG,  Washington, DC, June 10, 2025. Hon. Brett Guthrie, Chairman, House Energy & Commerce Committee, Washington, DC. Hon. Frank Pallone, Ranking Member, House Energy & Commerce Committee, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Guthrie and Ranking Member Pallone: The Mental Health Liaison Group (MHLG), a coalition of national organizations representing people with mental health conditions and substance use disorders, family members, mental health and addiction providers, advocates and other stakeholders is committed to strengthening Americans' access to mental health and substance use disorder care. We are incredibly disheartened by the proposal from the U.S.     Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to eliminate the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) as we know it, as well as drastically reduce spending or eliminate critical SAMHSA programs. Such a move would have devastating consequences for the 84.5 million Americans with a mental health and/or a substance use disorder, many of whom rely on SAMHSA's programs, research, oversight, and leadership to address critical mental health and substance use disorder needs. Since SAMHSA was established by Congress more than two decades ago, the agency has built an infrastructure to coordinate and lead public health efforts to advance the behavioral health of the nation. SAMHSA and most of its programs and activities are authorized under Title V of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), of which the Energy and Commerce Committee has sole jurisdiction. Yet, contrary to the statute, the HHS FY 2026 Budget in Brief proposes to eliminate SAMHSA and move some of its functions to a new Administration for a Healthy America (AHA). If this becomes reality, there will no longer be a federal agency whose specific purpose, function, and expertise is to address mental health and substance use disorders. Given the current opioid public health emergency, and our nation's ongoing mental health crisis, we are confused and troubled by this proposal. SAMHSA's work is lifesaving, helping ensure communities have access to mental health and substance use treatment services--along with suicide prevention strategies--with enough providers to deliver the care that every American deserves. SAMHSA's effectiveness is due to its position as a federal agency with its specific focus on supporting community-based mental health and substance abuse treatment and prevention services. Through the development of education, training, toolkits and resources; administering grants; and providing technical assistance informed by specialized expertise and data, SAMHSA is able to identify trends, implement efficiencies informed by current needs, and support states in providing community-based services for mental health conditions and substance use disorders. Additionally, the proposed HHS budget would eliminate scores of mental health programs, including some that your committee explicitly established in the landmark Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act of 2018. Programs slated for elimination include Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers and the Youth Prevention and Recovery Initiative. These are just two examples of programs that your committee authorized in 2018 and voted to reauthorize on a bipartisan basis earlier this year, in addition to other concerning eliminations within the Programs of Regional and National Significance and those related to combatting overdose-related deaths. These proposed eliminations come at the same time that HHS extended the public health emergency declaration for our nation's opioid crisis--targeting the same programs aimed at addressing this crisis. As leading voices working on mental health and substance use disorders, we believe it is paramount that the federal government retain a standalone agency explicitly focused on mental health and substance use disorders. In 2016, this committee recognized the importance of SAMHSA and the public health threats of mental health and addiction by elevating the leader of the agency from an Administrator to an Assistant Secretary of Mental Health and Substance Use, directly reporting to the Secretary. Within another agency, SAMHSA--and a focus on mental illness and addiction--will not have the same direct impact on HHS proposals and will not be elevated as a resource and partner for other components of HHS. SAMHSA has partnered with HRSA on workforce, CDC on the impact of infectious diseases on people with mental illness, NIH on early psychosis programs and CMS on health homes and demonstration programs in behavioral health. As with previous federal agency reorganizations, any efforts to change or reorganize SAMHSA should be directed by the Committee. Through your leadership of the Committee, our nation has made thoughtful progress to address our mental health and substance use crisis. We urge you to continue your bipartisan focus on proven programs that address severe, chronic, and, far too often, life-threatening mental illnesses that impact our families, friends, and neighbors in every comer of our nation.

"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General's report is scathing. GC Strategies received $64 million from the Liberal government, but in many cases, there was no evidence that any work had been done. GC Strategies is a two-person company that has received $64 million since the Liberals came to power. The estimated cost of the ArriveCAN app was $80,000, but in the end it cost upwards of $64 million. That is not double, triple or even quadruple the estimate; it is 800 times the amount. Had this happened in the private sector, everyone in the chain of command would have been laid off or fired, but these Liberal ministers were promoted. A Conservative motion will be moved today, and I hope the vote will be unanimous."
"I rise today to recognize and celebrate an extraordinary achievement by a remarkable young man from my district, Dillion Fountain, a vital member of the Walter H. Dyett High School for the Arts boys' basketball team, the Eagles. This team achieved a historic victory, winning the 2024-2025 Illinois High School Association (IHSA) Class 2A State Championship with a decisive 52-41 win over Althoff Catholic High School on March 15, 2025. This championship is more than just a win on the court; it is a profound testament to the resilience, determination, and unity of the Dyett High School community and the vibrant Bronzeville neighborhood. A decade ago, Dyett faced the threat of closure, but through powerful community advocacy and unwavering commitment, its doors remained open. Today, the Eagles' triumph, in which Dillion Fountainplayed a crucial role, symbolizes the incredible potential that flourishes when a community invests in its youth and its institutions. Dillion Fountain, along with his teammates, demonstrated exceptional skill, discipline, and teamwork throughout their season, navigating challenges and competing at the highest level. His hard work and dedication were integral to the team's success, culminating in this well-deserved championship that brings immense pride and joy to his school, family, and the entire community. I also extend my deepest gratitude to Head Coach Jamaal Gill, II, whose visionary leadership and guidance steered the team to this historic victory, and to Assistant Coaches Kimani Harris, Pierre Adams, and Nathan Townsen, Jr., whose mentorship was vital to the players' development. Mr. Speaker, Dillion Fountain's contribution to the Dyett Eagles' journey from near closure to state champions is an inspiring narrative for us all. It underscores the critical importance of supporting our public schools and investing in programs that empower young people to achieve their fullest potential. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dillion Fountain and the entire Dyett High School boys' basketball team on their momentous achievement and honoring them for the inspiration they provide to communities across our Nation."
Agreed. On division.
"I congratulate the Secretary of State on her statement. History tells us that normalising, condoning and tolerating the kind of things that we saw at Glastonbury over the weekend never ends well--it ends extremely badly. As a neighbouring MP, I have written twice to Worthy Farm with my concerns about Kneecap, following reports about one of its members advocating the killing of MPs. There was no reply--and none is expected. Instead, the festival scheduled Bob Vylan, who, as we heard, also advocates killing people--this time Jews. Does the Secretary of State agree that it is no good for Glastonbury's very wealthy organisers to be banging on about their festival being a safe space for everyone while it continues to facilitate operations like that?"
"I believe that we are doing the fair thing and the right thing. We are beginning to make reforms to put our welfare bill on a sustainable footing for generations to come. We are beginning to put in place the employment support that sick and disabled people have been denied for too long. We are making sure that those with severe and lifelong conditions are never again reassessed, and that there is a new right to try. I believe that this is a fair and balanced package. Above all, I believe that it is the right one."
"Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Bourassa . I am pleased to rise today to talk about the strong borders act. The legislation before the House would strengthen border protection and border security and ensure integrity in the immigration system, with new authorities to improve how client information is shared with provincial and territorial partners; enforce our laws more effectively; and support a sustainable system that restores balance and trust in immigration for Canadians and those seeking to come to our country. Overall, Bill C-2 would improve the flexibility and responsiveness of the asylum system by creating new ineligibility rules, removing incomplete or abandoned claims in the system and focusing resources on those who need protection the most. Let me talk about information sharing. As a former provincial minister of immigration, I know how important it is for the federal government to work with the provinces and territories to develop policies and programs. When I was minister of immigration in Nova Scotia, I understood how critical partnerships and co-operation between governments were to meeting the needs of employers and communities and supporting diverse groups of people. The information provided by the federal government helps provinces and territories effectively manage their programs and services. Let me be clear. This information sharing would, of course, continue to protect the personal information of applicants with strong safeguards. This would include a clear prohibition against provincial or territorial government partners further sharing any information with foreign entities except with the written consent of IRCC, where this would happen in a way that complies with Canada's international obligations. With respect to the new asylum ineligibilities, to protect our system against surges in claims, we are introducing new ineligibility rules for asylum. Let me be clear once again. Claiming asylum is not a shortcut to immigration. The ineligibilities would reduce pressures on the system so that we can provide protection for those in need efficiently. Under the proposed legislation, the federal government would no longer refer claims to the Immigration and Refugee Board for a decision if claims are made more than one year after someone's first arrival after June 24, 2020, or if claims are made 14 or more days after someone enters Canada irregularly between border crossings. The one-year limit discourages those wanting to use the asylum system as a way to extend their stay in Canada if other pathways fail. We are a generous country that values fairness, but Canadians expect us not to tolerate those who attempt to use the asylum system to bypass our laws and systems. With respect to the date that was selected, June 24, 2020, let me be clear that it was selected because that was the date the regulations were created to track the exit data. We are applying the same principle to those who cross the border irregularly. We know that some continue to cross the Canada-U.S. border irregularly despite our warnings and laws. By waiting 14 or more days before filing an asylum claim, they effectively avoid return to the U.S. under the safe third country agreement. Entering Canada between our points of entry is neither authorized nor safe. We have all seen the tragic loss of life or serious injuries to people who insisted on entering Canada through snow-covered fields, waterways or forests in the middle of winter. Not only are these crossings dangerous, but they are often linked to migrant trafficking and organized crime. They put people, including children, at even greater risk. I recommend that everyone who wants to come to Canada use our migration channels and programs. For these reasons, claims filed more than a year after a person first arrives, beginning on June 24, 2020, and those filed 14 days or more after they cross the border illegally will not be referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada for a decision. These measures would allow our decision-making body, the Immigration and Refugee Board, to focus on making final decisions on genuine claims. These ineligibility rules would protect against potential surges in claims, relieve the pressure on the asylum system and help the IRB work through its existing inventory of pending claims, including from those who genuinely need our protection and support. We recognize that our system needs to adapt to changing patterns and global migration. We need the system to be adaptable, flexible and responsive to changes so that we can safely manage the flow of people entering our country. In support of Canada's plan to strengthen border security in our immigration system, this legislation would introduce new authorities for Canada to respond to global events quickly and effectively. When the global pandemic hit in 2020, the federal government was forced to make the difficult decision to close our borders to protect the health and safety of Canadians. While our vetting and review processes are thorough, documented and empowered under the law, we do not have the power to suspend or cancel documents. Currently, officers have the authority to cancel a visa or electronic travel authorization on a case-by-case basis following a change in the status of the holder or because the holder is no longer entitled to hold the document. For example, if it is discovered that an application contains false statements or the applicant has a criminal record or is deceased, the agent would have the power to cancel this document. Right now, that power does not exist. This power does not apply to groups of immigration documents. This legislation would help Canada better respond to global events like the pandemic by allowing Canadian authorities to suspend, amend or cancel a number of immigration documents at once. These authorities would help us protect the public interest, protecting against safety and security threats, health risks and abuse of publicly funded programs. To be clear, there is no plan to cancel the documents of any particular groups. These measures are intended to strengthen the integrity of our immigration system for the future. The use of any of these authorities would require a separate process. Decisions would have to be driven by evidence and facts and would rest with the Governor in Council, not the minister alone. There are checks and balances in the process to ensure these measures would be used in the public interest of Canadians. Through this legislation, the government would improve and streamline our asylum system, strengthen how we work with provinces and territories, support Canada's asylum system, and focus our decisions and resources. We would empower government to respond to changing times quickly. These processes will be simpler, faster and more targeted. The proposed changes will improve public safety as well as the integrity of our government programs and services. There would be fast, fair and final decisions so that our system meets our economic, social and humanitarian objectives. I encourage all members to support this legislation to move these critical changes forward. I also encourage Canadians to look at the language of the legislation. If members help us put in these changes, we can have a system that we are proud of. With these words, I am happy to take a few questions."
"The member has used the Prime Minister 's name twice now. I know we are all back and are a bit rusty, but just as a reminder, we cannot use the names of ministers or the Prime Minister in this House."
"Mr. Chair, we have tightened the visa integrity measures. We have instituted financial requirements—"
"I totally agree. West London needs the same as the west of Scotland, the west of Wales, and all the other bits of those other nations. Men can access abiraterone on the NHS in Scotland and Wales, but not in England, even with an identical diagnosis. It seems at best anomalous that their postcode, not their prognosis, is determining their treatment, and we all know that the NHS is meant to be free at the point of need. I would give anything to have had longer with my dad. I was reminded of him when, like the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Tom Gordon), I had someone come to see me: Peter Treadgold, who came to my advice surgery and pointed out that he is falling between the cracks. He had a long-standing diagnosis, with remission, and he diligently followed all the advice. He was under NHS monitoring for 20 years because he had heightened prostate-specific antigen levels, although he was never actually offered an MRI or ultrasound scan. Last year, his cancer came back,  and he was told that he would need hormone and radiation therapy; abiraterone was not offered. Peter is one of the one in three people who get the devastating news that their cancer has come back, and has been denied access to a treatment that could save or extend his life. The first time I heard of abiraterone was when I met Peter, because as my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Danny Beales) said, in my dad's day, it would not have been cost-efficient. However, it is now a generic drug--it has gone off patent--but it is licensed only for metastatic cases. As my hon. Friend the Minister knows well, there is a complicated, convoluted process involved in getting it approved for non-metastatic cases. There is no question about the effectiveness of abiraterone. It has had one of the biggest trials known to mankind, a genuinely world-beating trial. When NHS England's own clinical priorities advisory group plotted the clinical benefit against the net cost, abiraterone scored highest in that tabulation. It is calculated that two years of abiraterone treatment would halve the death rate for men with locally advanced prostate cancer, but we hear about budgetary challenges. I have written to the Minister and tabled questions, and have been told that NHS England has not identified the recurrent budget to support provision of the drug. We should look long-term, at the remissions, and at the cost of chemotherapy, hospital appointments and other associated things. Those costs add up. University College London found that abiraterone would pay for itself if it were PS11 a day. Do Members know what the NHS is actually paying? Does anyone want to hazard a guess? Oh, we are not doing call and response. Abiraterone costs PS2.75 a day, now that it is off patent and has come down in price. That is less than three measly quid to avoid costly relapses, scans, chemo, hospital appointments and everything else--less than three little round ones to improve lives and reduce deaths. As we have heard, only people who can fork out up front for private treatment or private medical insurance currently have that option, and again, our NHS was not meant to be for private profiteering or big pharma drug pushers. People are seeing their pensions and life savings evaporate, and we are in a cost of living crisis. This drug should be universally available. It took less than one year for abiraterone to be approved for men with non-metastatic prostate cancer in Scotland and Wales. In England, it is now three years and counting, and we still have not had a concrete resolution. Right now, abiraterone is the cheapest and most cost-effective it has ever been, and as the excellent Prostate Cancer UK put it, the postcode lottery must end. Lord Darzi's independent investigations into the NHS found that the UK had higher cancer mortality rates than other comparable countries, and sadly, progress in diagnosing cancer at stages 1 and 2 is flatlining. Just over half of prostate cancers are caught at an early stage. That falls well short of the NHS target of 75%. I appreciate that Labour has just come into power after 14 years of the Conservative party, so it will take time to fix our health system, but we need it to be more responsive--to act early and rapidly, to use all the tools it can, and to offer preventive rather than after-the-fact care in every case. Abiraterone exemplifies all those things. I welcome the Chancellor's 3% real-terms increase in NHS spending to deliver the exciting plan to build an NHS fit for the future. With the 10-year plan coming soon and the national cancer strategy due this autumn, we have a real chance to deliver significant improvements for people living with cancer, so as is customary, I have a list of questions for the Minister. I will incorporate those of my hon. Friends--I think we are all friends here, even if we sit on opposite sides of the Chamber. First, will the Minister commit to exploring ways of ensuring that additional NHS funding is used to make abiraterone available to all men who need it in England--and in Northern Ireland, as the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) has pointed out? Secondly, will the Minister support the introduction of a national programme of screening for prostate cancer, like those that we have for comparable cancers in the United Kingdom? Thirdly, given the complexity of NHS England's decision-making processes in relation to the availability of abiraterone--which sound like a right old bureaucratic nightmare--as the functions of NHS England are transferred back to the Department of Health and Social Care, will the Minister take steps to ensure that all decisions about access to medicine, including abiraterone, are timely and transparent? I know that she has had a long career in the NHS, and as I have said, she is on the side of the angels. Fourthly, will the Minister commit to publishing an equality impact assessment, given the disturbingly disproportionate effect that prostate cancer is having on black men, who are more likely to develop it and to receive a late diagnosis, and less likely to receive the right treatment? I am doing this partly for Dad, who is watching from somewhere up above, but also for the black and minority ethnic men who are implicated here and now. This is the second time that you have been in the Chair, Madam Deputy Speaker, when I have been talking about health inequalities since Friday, when we discussed assisted dying. You have chaired both debates excellently. Fifthly, in the light of the lengthy approval process, will the Minister assess the adequacy of the funding formula model--we have NICE and we have the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, and it all seems a bit knotty--and consider whether novel pharmaceutical treatments could be produced cost-effectively, especially, as my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip said, when they come off-patent. I am arguing for simplification in cases in which drugs are already prescribed for limited use and there is a credible case for expanding their application to a generic treatment. We are halfway there; we just need to go that little bit further. Prostate Cancer UK estimates that 672 men die prematurely each year because we have no access to abiraterone. Each week that this continues, 13 men in England will die from a cancer that could have been treated cheaply had they lived in Scotland or Wales. Labour is the party of the NHS, and a Labour Government introduced the UK's first dedicated cancer strategy; so let us go for this win-win for all, end the iniquitous, unjust postcode lottery, celebrate the best of British science, and widen access to abiraterone for all those who need it, not just those who can afford it."
"I rise today to recognize the outstanding contributions that Mr. Ronnie Hutton has made to our community in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton. In addition to providing countless hours of direct support to neighbors and flood victims, he helped coordinate the collection and distribution of emergency supplies, meals and donated services to help those who needed help. A truly selfless leader, Mr. Hutton was a strong advocate for bringing in government and non-profit resources to aid in the recovery process. It is clear Ronnie Hutton has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility."
"This is why these statements are important. I think I need to check the answer, because I do not want to give a flippant answer to the right hon. Lady's incredibly serious question. Let me write to her to give her a proper answer."
"I am sure that Ministers across Government will have heard the important points that my hon. Friend has made today. Amendment 7 on consumer protection could have unintended consequences as product safety is not one-dimensional; it requires consideration of multiple risks and consumer and business needs. For example, we are undertaking a significant programme of work considering furniture safety and the balance between fire risks and the possible effects of exposure to chemical flame retardants. Were the amendment adopted, we would be open to challenge by any interest groups unhappy with how regulations balance those factors. Indeed, when I gave that example in Committee, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson, the hon. Member for Chippenham (Sarah Gibson), said that it was a compelling reason for not accepting the amendment, so I hope the hon. Member for Richmond Park will not move that amendment. Amendments 5 and 6 on the circular economy are unnecessary, as the Environment Act 2021 already requires the Government to consider the environmental impact of any new policies, and the Consumer Rights Act 2015 includes provisions on right to repair. On new clause 19, the Government are committed to meeting our obligations on the UK's trade agreements and nothing in the Bill will contradict that. New clauses 5 and 6 relate to small and medium-sized businesses. The purpose of new clause 5 is already met through existing practice, and that of new clause 6 is also met, as all regulations will be assessed in line with the better regulation framework principles. Similarly, amendment 8 on economic growth is unnecessary. All regulations will be subject to a statutory consultation and require an impact assessment as per the better regulation framework, ensuring that business needs are fully considered. The Bill will allow greater simplification and clarity on product requirements, which should ease burdens on industry. Let me turn to amendment 3 and new clause 10 on online marketplaces and supply chains. I agree that all relevant actors must be captured by our regulatory framework. That is why we have explicitly recognised and defined online marketplaces in the Bill, as well as including clause 2(3)(i) to ensure that ""any other person"" engaged in activities relating to a product can be brought within scope, including those working in fulfilment houses. At the earliest opportunity, we intend to consult on requirements applying to online marketplaces that protect consumers and are proportionate to the range of marketplace business models. The Bill gives us the opportunity to develop appropriate requirements, following consultation. That is better than requiring the introduction of specific obligations, irrespective of the outcome of consultation and consideration of proportionality. New clause 7 relates to online marketplaces being held liable for products purchased via their platforms. We agree that there is scope for improvements to be made in this area, which is why I have asked the Law Commission to conduct a full and comprehensive review of product liability legislation and make suggestions for reform. Following its report, which we anticipate will be released next year, we will legislate, if necessary, to ensure that our product liability laws are up to date and fit for the future. Turning briefly to new clause 9, the Bill's powers cover various product categories, including lithium-ion batteries. Although concerns about battery safety are  valid, the Bill must remain broad to address evolving products effectively. To improve lithium-ion battery safety, we have published research from the Warwick Manufacturing Group that highlights risks such as compatibility and design issues. Those findings will guide interventions, including regulatory standards and improved guidance. We are committed to collaborating with stakeholders to determine what actions should be taken forward. Amendments 21 to 24 would render unenforceable many requirements introduced in regulations under the Bill. Removing powers to create enforcement functions would make requirements introduced in new regulations ineffective, particularly for new supply chain actors. Without powers to effectively enforce new requirements, good businesses will be undermined by those who ignore their duties and responsibilities. I assure the House that the use of those powers already has precedent in comparable matters. The Building Safety Act 2022 is a recent example of primary legislation that created similar powers. New clause 11 and amendment 4 relate to product recall procedures. Supply chain actors are already under duties to report incidents to enforcement authorities, and the public can already access an online database of recalls: the product safety alerts, reports and recalls database. Furthermore, there are legislative routes for consumers to pursue their rights, including rights to repair, replace or refund, through various legislation, such as the Consumer Protection Act 1987 and the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. The Government are reviewing product recalls as well as the full range of existing enforcement powers for product safety and metrology so that the powers can be targeted and effective. The consultation following Royal Assent will seek views on the structure of such powers. I turn to new clause 12. Local authorities do vital work across several areas of consumer protection. This Bill is not the appropriate vehicle for a broader review of enforcement capability for consumer protection legislation, as it is limited to product and metrology regulation. However, it will help local authorities by simplifying product safety legislation and allowing the Government to consolidate enforcement powers. It will also provide for cost recovery powers to be obtained by local authorities--something raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow. New clauses 1 to 4 relate to product labelling. We will not be accepting them, but I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central for tabling new clause 1 and for shining a light, as he always does, on an important UK sector that is very important to his part of the world. Manufacturers can already indicate the country of origin on the labelling of their goods, as long as the information is accurate. Falsely claiming that products are made in the UK is an offence under existing UK consumer law, which prohibits traders from misleading consumers. I understand that my hon. Friend has a private Member's Bill on the country of origin for ceramics, which was introduced on 2 April and is listed for Second Reading next week. I will be interested to hear that debate, and I am always willing to engage with him on this important issue for his constituents. New clauses 2 to 4 relate to matters where separate legislation already applies. New clause 2 on the prices of goods falls under the Price Marking Order 2004, which includes requirements for unit pricing to be clearly labelled.  There are developments in this area. The Competition and Markets Authority published a report in July 2023 on the use of unit pricing in store and online in the groceries sector. Following this, it made recommendations to reform unit pricing legislation and proposed reforms to the Price Marking Order 2004. Amendments to the 2004 Order will come into force next April and will introduce additional requirements for retailers, such as consistency in unit pricing. That means that all unit prices for products sold by weight or volume must in future be displayed in either kilograms or litres. There will be stricter criteria on pricing legibility, and the changes will also provide clarity on how items in multibuy or loyalty card offers should be displayed. We believe that these changes will allow retailers to provide the information that customers need to make informed purchasing choices. Finally, new clauses 3 and 4 relate to country of origin information. This is already required for certain pre-packed foods, including beef. Origin labelling for food products, however, is well beyond the intended focus of the Bill. It is the case that current rules do not prevent British products from being labelled as British, and this is often done voluntarily. Indeed, the hon. Member for Richmond Park made reference to the ""Made in Britain"" campaign that is already in place. We do not believe it is necessary to legislate to set up a voluntary system when a voluntary system is already in place. In the light of that, I ask that the new clause 1 is withdrawn and all other amendments are not moved."
"We have invested more than PS200 million in the holiday activities and food programme, which supports children, offers enrichment opportunities and provides good-quality food during the Christmas, Easter and summer provision. That is a fantastic programme that I know Members across this House welcome, and a key part of our plan to ensure that every child can succeed and thrive."
Thousands more of my constituents in Glasgow will have money off their energy bills this winter as a result of this Labour Government's decision. I welcome the Minister's statement and ask her to assure me that the Government will continue to work hard to deliver lower energy bills for families in Glasgow.
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the people of Sarnia—Lambton—Bkejwanong for putting their trust in me for a fourth term as their member of Parliament. I want to thank my campaign manager, Anne Denman, and the many dedicated volunteers who worked to ensure a victory. Special shout-outs go to Mackenna, the best volunteer coordinator and door knocker ever; Brandon, the brains behind getting out the vote; and Bill, a.k.a. “Murph”, who made sure there were blue signs from one end of the riding to the other. I also want to thank my husband, Paul, who put up signs, door knocked, and was a major support for me, as he always is. I also thank my daughters, Gillian and Katie, for their love and support. I commit to being a strong voice for our issues in this riding and to be helpful to all constituents who need my assistance. These are challenging times, and I will be standing up for their civil liberties and the rights and freedoms we hold dear. I look forward to working with all sides of this House to build a better Canada for everyone."
"Mr. Chair, I have been the minister for a total of about three weeks already, and I do not recall saying statements like that."
"Mr. Speaker, what we are prepared to admit is that we landed generational investment in this country. We have seen companies like Volkswagen choosing Canada. We have seen companies like Honda choosing Canada. We have seen companies like Stellantis choosing Canada. The reasons are that we have the best workers in the world, we have a growing industry and they know Canada is the land of the future. The Conservatives should rally with us, cheer for our workers and cheer for our industry. Let us cheer for Canada together."
"It is a pleasure to speak after the hon. Member for East Renfrewshire (Blair McDougall) today; I spoke before him at the rally to which he refers. Those of us who have been sanctioned--I know that you, Madam Deputy Speaker, are among our number--are particularly conscious of the effect that the Chinese state has on our country. Do you, Madam Deputy Speaker, honestly believe that the Minister thinks that the Chinese would look at this proposal in the same way? Do we in this House honestly believe that something threatening our economic security, as highlighted by the Americans and the Dutch, should go through a bureaucratic planning process, with no ability to vary it, because, frankly, them's the orders? I do not think that is the way China would do it, and it is certainly not the way we should do it."
"I thank my hon. Friend for her excellent work as Chair of the Transport Committee, which has shown on a cross-party basis why the announcements we have made today are good for the economy, good for jobs and good for constituencies across the United Kingdom. She encourages me to answer questions about statements that will be made next week. All I can say at this stage, I am afraid, is that there is not long to go."
"Madam Chair, I was reaching out to the Bloc Québécois. What more can they ask of someone than to reach out to them to move forward on taxation in this country?"
"Mr. Speaker, it is always an honour and a privilege to rise in the House of Commons to speak on behalf of the residents of Vaughan—Woodbridge. However, today I rise to speak on behalf of Canadians across the country who are watching their choices being stripped away by a government that feels it should exercise more and more control over their lives, who are watching the cost of living rise and who, once again, are going to be faced with even more rising costs because of the ideologically driven agenda of the Liberal government. This should not be a partisan issue. At a time when Canadian auto workers are facing unjustified tariffs from our neighbours south of the border, significant job losses are happening across the country, and with unemployment the highest it has been in decades outside the pandemic, our Conservative motion is a common-sense motion that the government should adopt. It is not like it is outside of its scope to recognize and course correct when it introduces bad policy. It did that when it recognized that Conservatives had been right and repealed the consumer carbon tax, for example. For those watching at home, here is what the Conservative motion that we are debating today says. It reads, “That, given that the Liberal government is banning the sale of gas powered vehicles that will force Canadians to buy electric vehicles, and this mandate will drive up the cost of vehicles by $20,000...the House call on the Liberal government to immediately end their ban on gas-powered vehicles.” This is so Canadians would be able to buy the cars that suit their needs and budget. This is not about whether someone can or should buy an electric vehicle. If someone wants one, that is great. They should buy one. What we oppose is the government taking away consumer choice. We oppose the government thinking it knows best, and we oppose a government mandate that has negative impacts on our economy and the cost of living. Make no mistake, that is what this mandate does. It does not encourage EV use. It bans gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035; forces quotas on manufacturers, during a time when they are facing tariffs from our neighbour to the south; and punishes Canadians with higher prices if they dare to choose something different, during a time when most Canadians can barely afford groceries, their rent or their car insurance. Here is what is happening: Starting in 2026, automakers will be forced to ensure 20% of their sales are zero-emission vehicles. That target ramps up to 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. This is a radical government-mandated phase-out of gas-powered vehicles. It is ridiculous and ideologically driven. This mandate does not care if someone lives in an urban area like Toronto or a rural community in northern B.C. There is no consideration of the impact on cost and no thought of the impact on automotive manufacturers and the consequences for major automotive manufacturers and their workers. What about those who commute long distances to and from work, in the cold, when the battery life is barely half? This motion is not about opposing EVs. It is far from that. I was in an EV and drove from Vaughan to Ottawa. We had to drive 15 minutes out of the way to find a charger to charge it in the summer, and that took about 30 minutes. I can imagine, if it were -30°C outside, how many times we would have had to have stopped because of how dead our battery would have been. How about the grid and the infrastructure required to support it? We are far from being ready for that. We would need nearly 700,000 charging ports from coast to coast. We have about 60,000 now. This would require a radical transformation that, especially given the Liberals' track record for getting things done, would be next to impossible to achieve in the next 10 years. We are installing fewer and fewer chargers year over year, not more and more. We would need over $600 billion in new infrastructure to support this. These are the same guys who put billions into a housing accelerator fund, only to create more government bureaucracy with no results. It gets even better. Only radical environmentalists could think of a scheme where, if automakers do not meet their quota, they would be faced with a $20,000 penalty per vehicle when they are short of their targets. Let me repeat that. There would be a $20,000 tax per vehicle, which would absolutely be passed on to the consumers in the form of higher vehicle prices. It is not rocket science. This is not a climate plan. It is a tax plan, and it is a control plan, one that perfectly highlights everything that has been wrong with the Liberal government over the last decade. This mandate will have devastating consequences, not just for consumers, but for workers and the Canadian auto sector. A study published in the Canadian Journal of Economics estimates that the mandate will eliminate 38,000 jobs in the auto sector and cost the economy $138.7 billion. Even auto industry leaders, those investing in EVs, are sounding the alarm. Last week, while at the Canada Automotive Summit hosted in my hometown of Vaughan, Bev Goodman, CEO of Ford Canada, said the mandate would “have a negative impact”, including a “downward pressure on...sales, [an] upward pressure on pricing, and...real concerns for consumers and the industry”. Furthermore, Kristian Aquilina, president of GM Canada, said, “It's unrealistic to believe that the country is going to go from 5 or 6 per cent [of EV sales] to 20 per cent by model year '26”. That would force them to have to restrict the ability to sell gas-powered vehicles, and we have to think about the dealership jobs across the country and the manufacturing jobs that are reliant on those sales. Brian Kingston of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association said, “The federal EV mandate needs to be repealed before serious damage is done to the auto industry at the worst possible time.” These are not political voices. They are industry leaders who want EVs to succeed, but who are being asked to do the impossible on an unrealistic timeline in a market that is not ready. Canadians are not buying EVs in large numbers because they cannot afford them. Right now, demand for EVs is stalling at about 8% to 10% of new car sales in Canada. They remain, on average, $15,000 more expensive than comparable gas vehicles. That is even after taxpayer-funded subsidies. Those subsidies do not come from thin air. They come from Canadians' pockets. Even if someone does not drive an EV, they are paying for someone else's. It gets worse. Once these quotas and penalties take effect, automakers will raise their prices on gas-powered vehicles to offset the cost of compliance. This means that everyone would pay more, even those who cannot or will not buy an EV. The CAA found that electric vehicles lose up to 40% of their battery life in cold conditions, as mild as -7°C to -15°C. Yes, that is mild in this country. What does this mean for Canadians in Winnipeg, Thunder Bay or rural Alberta, where winters last half the year? EVs are not a universal solution. On the topic of the grid, our provincial grids are already strained. Ontario Hydro, Hydro-Québec and BC Hydro are warning of growing demand and rising costs. What happens when we go from 8% EVs to 100%? The Liberals have no answer. Their plan is more debt, more subsidies, more taxes and more big shiny announcements. Let us not forget the role of the Prime Minister , who seems to be the architect of much of this ideological shift. Back in 2021, in the Prime Minister 's book Values , he wrote that we need regulations to phase out the sale of new gas vehicles in the next decade. At the Council on Foreign Relations, he talked about using regulation to shape consumer behaviour through bans, quotas and carbon taxes. He even praised Europe's ban as the model that should be replicated right here in Canada. If Liberals truly believed in reducing emissions, they would unleash Canadian innovation. They would support hybrid options, cleaner fuels, and the development of Canadian oil and gas with lower emissions rather than dirty dictator oil to arbitrarily offset emissions. They would back nuclear. They would invest in charging networks before mandating bans. They would trust the market. Instead, they have chosen top-down mandates, higher prices and fewer choices. The people who will be hurt the most include the single mom in Vaughan trying to afford a used Civic and the tradesman in Hamilton who hauls heavy equipment. These are the people the Liberals forgot. These are the people who we are standing up for. A Conservative government would repeal the EV mandate, scrap the industrial carbon tax, eliminate fuel standards that punish working people, and support innovation through freedom and competition, not coercion. Most importantly, we would let Canadians choose the vehicle that works best for them. If it is gas, hybrid, diesel, electric or whatever, it will be without judgment, penalties or government overreach. It is time to put Canadians back in the driver's seat. I urge all members of the House to support this motion. Let us stand up for choice, affordability, common sense and the millions of Canadians who deserve better than a government that tells them what to drive, how to live and what to think. Let us repeal the mandate, end the ban and bring home control over our cars, our choices and our lives."
"Mr. Speaker, there is a difference between average and maximum. The maximum is indeed $840 per year. This is a tax cut for 22 million Canadians. I thank members for supporting this measure."
"If I may briefly say so, I am very proud that the spending review delivered the largest ever investment in employment support for sick and disabled people--quadrupling what we inherited from the last Government to over PS1 billion a year, or a total of PS3.5 billion over this Parliament--so that those who can work get the support they need, while we protect those who can never work. Tackling child poverty is my personal priority, so I am proud that the Education Secretary and I are bringing in free school meals for all children in families on universal credit, lifting 100,000 children out of poverty--a down payment on our child poverty strategy. We are also delivering the first ever three-year funding settlement for the household support fund, including for holiday hunger, and we are committed to funding the holiday activities and food programme, stopping kids going hungry while they are at school and during the holidays, too."
"Pursuant to order made on Tuesday, May 27, the committee of the whole convenes today for the sole purpose of asking questions to the government in regard to the estimates. The first round will begin with the official opposition, followed by the government and the Bloc Québécois. After that, we will follow the usual proportional rotation. Each member recognized by the Chair will be allocated 15 minutes. These periods may be used for both debate and for posing questions. Should members wish to use this time to make a speech, it can last a maximum of 10 minutes, leaving at least five minutes for questions to the minister or the parliamentary secretary acting on behalf of the minister. When members are recognized, they shall indicate to the Chair how the 15-minute period will be used, in other words, what portion will be used for speeches and what portion for questions and answers. Members who wish to share their time with one or more members shall indicate it to the Chair. When the time is to be used for questions, the minister's or parliamentary secretary's response should reflect approximately the time taken to ask the question, since this time will count toward the time allotted to the member. The period of time for the consideration of the estimates in committee of the whole this evening shall not exceed four hours. I also wish to indicate that, in committee of the whole, comments should be addressed through the Chair. I ask for everyone's co-operation in upholding all established standards of decorum, parliamentary language and behaviour. In addition, pursuant to order made Tuesday, May 27, no quorum calls, dilatory motions or requests for unanimous consent shall be received by the Chair. The hon. member for Calgary East."
"Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his highly pertinent questions. Our goal is to be able to work with him, through Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions, for instance, so that even businesses in the Beauce region that manufacture prefabricated homes can have a hand in achieving the housing priorities of the minister and the government. I look forward to working with him. We need to create jobs, and we need to build homes."
"Mr. Chair, the correct answer is $10 billion. Does the minister know how much in countervailing duties paid by Quebec is currently sitting in the United States?"
"I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.

"3 years ago today, the infamous holding of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey were reversed by the Dobbs decision, brilliantly written by Justice Samuel Alito, who hails from my State and from my home county, joined by the majority of the Supreme Court. They said this: ``The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion . . .'' They went on to say: ``. . . the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives.'' A new national debate on abortion began 3 years ago. While there will be setbacks along the way, every human rights struggle has them. I believe that growing numbers of Americans are finally recognizing the cheap sophistry, the megadeception, and the culture of denial that devalues and disrespects unborn baby girls and unborn baby boys and trivializes the harm suffered by women. The comprehensive 2025 nationwide Marist Poll found that Americans are against taxpayer-funded abortion, both at home and overseas in our foreign aid; strongly support pregnancy care centers, I mean very strongly support them; and want significant restrictions on abortion. A large number of elected representatives have passed pro-life laws to protect unborn children, including the State of Texas; and when a heartbeat can be detected at around 6 weeks in States like Florida, Georgia, Iowa, and South Carolina; or when the child suffers excruciating physical pain, as we know they do, from the abortion procedure, particularly as the child is being dismembered. That is a procedure used to kill these children at about 12 to 15 weeks. To date, 24 States have enacted pro-life laws to protect unborn children and women from the violence of abortion. Meanwhile, I am happy to say there are more than 2,700 pregnancy care centers throughout the United States, each and every one of them an oasis of love, compassion, empathy, respect, and care for both mothers and their precious children. Abortion extremists in several States, on the other hand, including in my own State of New Jersey, have enacted anti-child laws that legally authorize killing unborn babies right up until the moment of birth and also forcing taxpayers to subsidize the violent deed. Twice the Democratic-led House of Representatives passed extremist legislation that would have explicitly sanctioned abortion throughout all 9 months of pregnancy, again, right up to the moment of birth, and would have nullified even modest restrictions enacted over the past half century, including informed consent, waiting periods, and parental notification statutes. Let me just point out to my colleagues, the so-called abortion pill, mifepristone, is baby poison. It kills the unborn infant by starving the innocent child to death. I have done a lot of work on the Foreign Affairs Committee over the years on food security. I have written two bills that passed the House, called the Global Food Security Act. I am all about, as we all are, mitigating hunger in our hometowns and across the world. What does mifepristone do? It starves the baby to death. The little child can't get the nutrients he or she needs to survive. This statement by Dr. Francis makes it clear:  It leads to starvation and eventual death to the fetal human being.  We also know now, however, that mifepristone is extremely dangerous to women as well, and this is especially important because this dangerous drug is used to procure abortion 60 percent of the time, 6 out of 10 abortions in the United States. On April 28, 2015, the Ethics and Public Policy Center released a report titled: ``The Abortion Pill Harms Women: Insurance Data Reveals One in Ten Patients Experiences a Serious Adverse Event.'' The key findings were that women who take this drug experience sepsis, infection, hemorrhaging, and other serious adverse events within about 45 days of taking it. It was the largest study ever, known study of the abortion pill, 28 times as many abortions as were included in all FDA- cited clinical trials combined. This is the megastudy, and it found what was not found earlier because in many cases those trials were sham trials. Let me also point out that it needs to be revisited. We call on the FDA to look at what has been done to women because of this terrible, terrible abortion drug. Let me just conclude before yielding to my very distinguished colleagues: I believe that future generations of Americans will some day look back on us and wonder how and why a society that bragged about its commitment tohuman rights could have legally sanctioned and aggressively promoted abortion by child starvation or by dismemberment, beheading, chemical poisoning, and forced expulsion from the womb. I call on my colleagues to defend life. I also would point out, in an information age, they will wonder, as I do now, how was it that so many were deceived into believing that somehow abortion is safe. It is never safe for the baby, and it is certainly not safe for the mother, as well. The injustice of abortion violence need not be forever, and we stand united in trying to protect those innocent human beings. I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson), our very distinguished Speaker of the House."
"Mr. Speaker, I think that the member and I could work well together on the environment. Capping greenhouse gas emissions is very important. In Canada, 30% of our emissions come from the oil and gas sector. It it very important that all sectors, all industries in our country work to help us cap and even reduce our emissions. We are continuing our work by using all the tools we have so that—"
"The consent to develop the Rosebank oilfield was deemed unlawful by the courts. The developer will need to reapply for consent, including an assessment of emissions from burning the fuel produced. We will produce guidance on the environmental assessment of those emissions in due course."
We are not here to amend the Abortion Act. This is not a Backbench Business debate. We are here to debate an amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill. I hope that the hon. Lady stands corrected.
"With permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement on the strategic defence review. I have laid the full 130-page review before the House, and I am grateful for the opportunity to do so and to make this statement on our first day back from the recess. The world has changed, and we must respond. The SDR is our Plan for Change for defence: a plan to meet the threats that we face, a plan to step up on European security and to lead in NATO, a plan that learns the lessons from Ukraine, a plan to seize the defence dividend resulting from our record increase in defence investment and boost jobs and growth throughout the United Kingdom, and a plan to put the men and women of our armed forces at the heart of our defence plans, with better pay, better kit and better housing. Through the SDR, we will make our armed forces stronger and the British people safer. I thank those who led the review, Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, General Barrons and Dr Fiona Hill, ""a politician, a soldier and a foreign policy expert"", as they describe themselves in their foreword. They, alongside others, have put in a huge effort. This is a ""first of its kind"", externally led review, the result of a process in which we received 8,000 submissions from experts, individuals, organisations and Members on both sides of the House, including the shadow Defence Secretary. I thank them all, and I thank those in the Ministry of Defence who contributed to this SDR. It is not just the Government's defence review, but Britain's defence review. The Government endorse its vision and accept its 62 recommendations, which will be implemented. The threats that we face are now more serious and less predictable than at any time since the end of the cold war. We face war in Europe, growing Russian aggression, new nuclear risks, and daily cyber-attacks at home. Our adversaries are working more in alliance with one another, while technology is changing the way in which war is fought. We are living in a new era of threat, which demands a new era for UK defence. Since the general election we have demonstrated that we are a Government dedicated to delivering for defence. We have committed ourselves to the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war, with an extra PS5 billion this year and 2.5% of GDP in 2027, and the ambition to hit 3% in the next Parliament. However, there can be no investment without reform, and we are already driving the deepest reforms of defence in 50 years. Those reforms will ensure clearer responsibilities, better delivery, stronger budget control and new efficiencies worth PS6 billion in this Parliament, all of which will be reinvested directly in defence. Our armed forces will always do what is needed to keep the nation safe, 24/7, in more than 50 countries around the world; but in a more dangerous world, as the SDR confirms, we must move to warfighting readiness, and warfighting readiness means stronger deterrence. We need stronger deterrence to avoid the huge costs, human and economic, that wars create, and we prevent wars by being strong enough to fight and win them. That is what has made NATO the most successful defence alliance in history over the last 75 years. We will  establish a new ""hybrid Navy"" by building Dreadnought, AUKUS submarines, cutting-edge warships and new autonomous vessels. Our carriers will carry the first hybrid airwings in Europe. We will develop the next generation Royal Air Force with F-35s, upgraded Typhoons, sixth-generation Global Combat Air Programme jets and autonomous fighters to defend Britain's skies and to be able to strike anywhere in the world, and we will make the British Army 10 times more lethal by combining the future technology of drones, autonomy and artificial intelligence with the heavy metal of tanks and artillery. For too long, our Army has been asked to do more with less. We inherited a long-running recruitment crisis, following 14 years of Tory cuts to full-time troops. Reversing the decline will take time, but we are acting to stem the loss and aiming to increase the British Army to at least 76,000 full-time soldiers in the next Parliament. For the first time in a generation, we have a Government who want the number of regular soldiers to rise. This Government will protect our island home by committing PS1 billion in new funding to homeland air and missile defences, creating a new cyber-command to defend Britain in the grey zone, and preparing legislation to improve defence readiness. As Ukraine shows, a country's armed forces are only as strong as the industry that stands behind them, so this SDR begins a new partnership with industry, innovators and investors. We will make defence an engine for growth to create jobs and increase prosperity in every nation and region of the UK. Take our nuclear enterprise. We will commit to investing PS15 billion in the sovereign warhead programme in this Parliament, supporting over 9,000 jobs. We will establish continuous submarine production through investments in Barrow and Derby that will enable us to produce a submarine every 18 months, allowing us to grow our nuclear attack fleet to up to 12 submarines and supporting more than 20,000 jobs. On munitions, we will invest PS6 billion in this Parliament, including in six new munitions factories and in up to 7,000 new long-range weapons, supporting nearly 2,000 jobs. The lives of workers in Barrow, Derby and Govan, where the Prime Minister and I were this morning, are being transformed not just by this defence investment but by the pride and purpose that comes with defence work. In the coming years, more communities and more working people will benefit from the defence dividend that this SDR brings. Ukraine also tells us that whoever gets new technology into the hands of their armed forces the fastest will have the advantage, so we will place Britain at the leading edge of innovation in NATO. We will double investment in autonomous systems in this Parliament, invest more than PS1 billion to integrate our armed forces through a new digital targeting web, and finance a PS400 million UK defence innovation organisation. To ensure that Britain gains the maximum benefit from what we invent and produce in this country, we will create a new defence exports office in the MOD, driving exports to our allies and driving growth at home. The SDR sets a new vision and a new framework for defence investment. The work to confirm a new defence investment plan, which will supersede the last Government's defence equipment plan, will be completed in the autumn. It will ensure that our frontline forces get what they need, when they need it. The plan will be deliverable and affordable, and it will consider infrastructure alongside  capabilities. It will seize the opportunities of advanced tech, and seize the opportunities to grow the British economy. As we lose the national service generation, fewer families across this country will have a direct connection to the armed forces, so we must do more to reconnect the nation with those who defend us. As the SDR recommends, we will increase the number of cadets by 30%, introduce a voluntary ""gap year"" scheme for school and college leavers, and develop a new strategic reserve by 2030. We must also renew the nation's contract with those who serve. We have already awarded the biggest pay increase in over 20 years and an inflation-busting increase this year, and now I have announced that we will invest PS7 billion of funding during this Parliament for military accommodation, including PS1.5 billion of new money for rapid work to deal with the scandal of military family homes. This SDR is the first defence review in a generation for growth and for transformation in UK defence. It will end the 14 years of the hollowing out of our armed forces. Instead, we will see investment increased, the Navy expanded, the Army grown, the Air Force upgraded, warfighting readiness restored, NATO strengthened, the nuclear deterrent guaranteed, advanced technology developed, and jobs created in every nation and region of this country. The strategic defence review will make Britain safer, more secure at home and stronger abroad."
"Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague talked about how this particular scandal would be dealt with in the private sector. We know that in 2015, Justin Trudeau promised Canadians that he would be open by default and that if the Liberals made a mistake, they would own up to it and apologize. Can my colleague identify any particular minister or deputy minister who has accepted responsibility for the boondoggle?"

"Mr. Chair, Canada is one of the largest countries in the world, stretching from the Pacific to the Atlantic and up to the Arctic Ocean. This vast geography provides Canada with access to a wide range of global shipping routes and international markets, giving us a unique advantage in global trade. From the Port of Vancouver facilitating trade with Asia to the Port of Halifax opening access to Europe, and the increasingly strategic importance of Arctic shipping lanes, our ports serve as critical gateways to the world. Given this unique positioning, how can strong, efficient and modernized ports help ensure that Canada remains well connected to global markets now and into the future? In what ways can investing in advanced port infrastructure, such as expanded capacity, improved technology and better intermodal connections, enhance our competitiveness in international trade, reduce bottlenecks and support the seamless movement of Canadian goods and resources across borders? Additionally, how can better-connected ports help businesses across all regions of the country, not just those near the coasts, take advantage of global trade opportunities? As the global economy becomes increasingly reliant on fast, resilient supply chains, what role do Canada's ports play in supporting the long-term sustainability, security and prosperity of our national economy?"

"Mr Speaker, Canadians made a very clear choice in April to elect a government that is focused on delivering housing, and we will do that. The housing accelerator fund has been extraordinarily well supported by over 200 communities across Canada. If the members opposite do not believe in the program, they can talk to their mayors and councillors and continue to throw them under the bus. This government is going to work in that partnership, and we are going to deliver housing with communities across Canada."
"Mr. Chair, I would like to extend my congratulations to the minister on his appointment. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has warned that, to pay for the government's promises, deep cuts to the federal public service will be unavoidable. Canadians deserve to know what things are going to be cut. Is it their public health care system? Is it veteran services? What will be cut to make sure that the government can live up to the promises they have already made?"
"I rise today to recognize and commend Mission Mississippi of Leflore County, a remarkable organization based in Greenwood, Mississippi, for its unwavering commitment to racial reconciliation, spiritual healing, and community building. Founded as part of the broader Mission Mississippi movement, which began in Jackson in 1992, the Leflore County chapter has become a beacon of hope and unity in the Mississippi Delta. At a time when division often dominates our national discourse, this grassroots organization brings people together across racial and denominational lines through intentional fellowship, shared meals, and mutual respect. Mission Mississippi of Leflore County is led by Mr. Terry Williams, a local painting contractor and pastor, and Mr. Luke Quinn, a minister and clinical therapist. Together, they facilitate regular gatherings-- often breakfasts or luncheons--that rotate between churches with historically Black or White congregations. These events are not mere meetings; they are powerful acts of reconciliation, fostering honest dialogue, trust, and deeper understanding among individuals of diverse backgrounds. Through these efforts, Mission Mississippi of Leflore County engages in what Mr. Williams aptly describes as ``heart work''--emphasizing their belief that the path to racial harmony begins with the courage to know one another, to listen, and to love unconditionally. Their work underscores that true unity is not achieved solely through laws or policies, but through relationships and shared purpose. In January of this year, the chapter hosted a luncheon at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church, followed by a community meal in April that featured remarks from Dr. Montrell Greene, pastor of Sycamore Street Church of Christ. These are but a few examples of their ongoing efforts to bring diverse voices to the table and create a space where differences are acknowledged and celebrated. Mr. Quinn, reflecting on his journey from Texas to Georgia to Wisconsin before settling in the Delta, spoke candidly of Mississippi's often misunderstood legacy. He rightly observed that Mississippi is too frequently portrayed as a scapegoat for America's racial challenges, when in truth, it is home to many individuals working tirelessly to heal those very wounds--Mission Mississippi of Leflore County among the foremost. Grounded in faith and expansive in impact, their mission exemplifies what it means to live out the gospel in a divided world--breaking bread, building bridges, and showing that we have more in common than in conflict. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mission Mississippi of Leflore County for their vital work in uplifting their community, challenging stereotypes, and leading with grace and love. Their efforts remind us that reconciliation is possible--one conversation, one relationship, and one act of compassion at a time."
"My hon. Friend is right to raise that important point. It is truly shameful that 4.5 million children in the UK now live in poverty. We are developing an ambitious strategy that tackles root causes, and we are already taking action. Alongside cross-Government work on free school meals, breakfast clubs and funded childcare, the Department is investing PS56 million in Start for Life services and supporting healthy diets for 358,000 people through Healthy Start."
Was it Kwasi Kwarteng that the hon. Gentleman replaced? Now he stands there to give lectures on economic prudence--you couldn't script it! The difference between the Labour Government and the parties opposite is that we believe in properly costing our plans. Reform has PS80 billion-worth of unfunded commitments--Liz Truss 2.0.
"Mr. Chair, it is an important question. I will go back with my officials, and we will work through details on that particular program."

Shall clause 2 carry?
"Mr. Speaker, with the ongoing genocide in Gaza by Netanyahu, the expansion of settlements, the announcement of 22 new settlements planned for the West Bank, and Canada's obligation under the Genocide Convention, is your government planning to suspend the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement as New Democrats have asked you to do?"
"Mr. Speaker, I think Canadians made a clear decision, and they asked for a clear mandate for this new government to do just that, to stand here, stand up for them and unite us as a country in this incredibly difficult time. That is what we are going to do."
"Mr. Chair, I do not know where the drug policy fits within the estimates for Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada."
I call the shadow Secretary of State.
"An NHS fit for the future--I congratulate the Chancellor and the Health Secretary on the investment in the health service in England. Given the money that has been allocated to Northern Ireland, will the Chancellor encourage the Executive to provide the same investment in the health service in Northern Ireland? The Executive have been working with single-year budgets since 2016. Does the Chancellor agree that this SR allows them to set a multi-year, recurrent budget that allows the transformation of health services and other public services in Northern Ireland?"
"due to obligations, I was unable to vote on June 9, 2025 on H. Res. 481, H. Res. 488, and H.R. 2035. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 157; YEA on Roll Call No. 158; and YEA on Roll Call No. 159."
"Mr. Speaker, I would remind my colleague that the office of supplier integrity and compliance operates at arm's length from the government. It decided to bar GC Strategies for the next seven years. We have already taken action against this supplier because we will never tolerate bad actors in our supply process. We have taken legal action against GC Strategies and referred cases to the RCMP. We terminated all contracts with GC Strategies more than a year ago and revoked this supplier's security clearance because we will always defend the integrity of our procurement system."
"The hon. Gentleman sets out the current position and what has happened in the past. What we are announcing today will lift more children out of poverty, because more children will be eligible for free school meals. He makes a number of points on breakfast clubs; obviously, we are committed to rolling out the clubs to every primary school in the country. I would be delighted to meet him to hear his particular thoughts and views on how that can make the biggest difference in his constituency."
"Our UK defence industry can have few better ambassadors around the world than our Red Arrows. As the Hawk aircraft comes to an end, will the Minister look closely at the British-designed modular aircraft being developed by Aeralis, because it would support SMEs right across our country, including by bringing around 600 jobs to StandardAero in Gosport and about 1,000 to the south Hampshire area? Surely that would be a much better way to support our national SMEs than opting for the Italian-Russian Yak-130 aircraft, which the MOD is rumoured to prefer."

"The failure to get transparent information from the United Nations Special Commission and the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission caused untold damage 22 years ago. What discussions has my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary had with Director General Grossi at the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure that there is real transparency and real information on which we can base any action?"
"Mr. Speaker, one of the incredible things about car dealerships is that they are often family businesses. I grew up down the street from a car dealer, and his son is now running that particular business. There is incredible investment that comes with running a car dealership. It involves renting space. It involves hiring a large number of employees. Car dealers are among the largest employers in my community of Nanaimo. When they only have a limited amount of floor space and are trying to run a business, for the government to come in and tell them that the business they have been running needs to be augmented by a different business that needs to be run in the same space with the same people, it creates a second set of overhead. It creates a second set of services, and it makes it very difficult for them to be able to innovate and manage their business. The hardship—"
"Mr. Speaker, in May, GM announced a record-setting $888-million investment in one of our local V8 engine plants. The problem is that it is investing it in Tonawanda, New York, just miles away from our very own V8 engine plant in St. Catharines. Workers in Niagara are worried about their future, and now a new report says that the unjustified U.S. tariffs could kill over 50,000 auto sector jobs in Canada. Will the Liberals admit their failure to get a deal with the U.S. threatens to kill thousands of good-paying auto sector jobs in southern Ontario?"
"Small businesses--like Rezon in my constituency, which makes groundbreaking brain protection sports headwear--are working hard to grow and export, but it is often hard to know where to get the right advice. What practical support are the Government giving to small businesses to help them export and take full advantage of those trade deals?"
"The use of animals in research raises serious questions about animal welfare, particularly in procedures that cause pain, distress or even death. Does my hon. Friend agree that advances in technology are making the transition away from animal testing more feasible? In vitro techniques using human cells and tissues, computer modelling, and organ-on-a-chip technologies provide promising human-relevant alternatives. These methods can offer faster, more cost-effective and more ethically sound results than traditional animal tests."
"last Congress, Republicans introduced 26 bills or amendments to change local D.C. election laws, including 14 to prohibit noncitizens from voting in D.C. or to repeal, nullify, or prohibit the carrying out of the local D.C. law that allows noncitizens to vote in local elections. Yet, Republicans refused to make the only election law change D.C. has requested, which is to make D.C. a State so they can hold elections for voting Members of the House and Senate. While Congress has the authority to legislate on local D.C. matters, it is not required to do so. In Federalist No. 43, James Madison said of D.C. residents: ``A municipal legislature for local purposes, derived from their own suffrages, will of course be allowed them.'' In 1953, the Supreme Court held that ``there is no constitutional barrier to the delegation by Congress to the District of Columbia of full legislative power.'' Mr. Speaker, I want to discuss democracy, or lack thereof, in D.C. There are 700,000 D.C. residents. D.C. residents are required to pay Federal taxes, register with the Selective Service System, and serve on Federal juries in the same manner as residents of States. Yet, D.C. residents have no voting representation in Congress, and Congress has the ultimate say on local D.C. matters. The council has 13 members. If D.C. residents do not like how the members vote, residents can vote them out of office or pass a ballot measure. That is called democracy. Congress has 535 voting Members. None are elected by D.C. residents. If D.C. residents do not like how the Members vote on local D.C. matters, residents cannot vote them out of office or pass a ballot measure. That is the antithesis of democracy. The substance of this bill is irrelevant since there is never jurisdiction for Congress to legislate on local D.C. matters. However, I will briefly discuss it. D.C. allows noncitizens to vote in local elections because it believes that all adult residents deserve a say in their local government. While D.C. law allows noncitizens to vote only in local elections, 40 States and the Federal Government allowed noncitizens to vote in local, State, territorial, and Federal elections at various points, including at the founding. The Federal Government first prohibited noncitizens from voting in Federal elections only 29 years ago. Today, nearly 20 cities allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. As the House has considered this bill, Republicans have repeatedly said the franchise is a right of citizenship. If that is what Republicans believe, I hope they will finally grant American citizens who live in D.C. the right to vote for voting representation in Congress. I have introduced H.R. 51 to do so. Pursuant to the Admissions Clause and District Clause of the Constitution, H.R. 51 would admit the residential and commercial areas of D.C. as a new State. Statehood would not only give D.C. voting representation in Congress, but it would also give D.C. full local self-government. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to respect the will of D.C. residents by voting ``no'' on H.R. 884."
"Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to see my former colleague from the Quebec National Assembly here in Ottawa. At the time, when my colleague was Quebec's finance minister, he presented a budget within 46 days of taking office. What does he think of the time frame that is now being given to the federal Minister of Finance ?"
"York Central, our biggest brownfield site, will release 12,500 new jobs in advanced and digital rail and the digital creative sector, as well as in the bio-economy mentioned in my right hon. Friend's brilliant industrial strategy. Will he, however, ensure that innovation hubs at the centre of these cluster developments are able to come on-stream and get the funding they need to unlock these sites?"
"today, I introduce a bill to name the post office at 3401 12th Street, Northeast in the District of Columbia for go-go legend Chuck Brown. Chuck Brown, the ``Godfather of Go-Go,'' is beloved by D.C. for his innovative and unique sound, which gave us go-go music. Go-go is the beat of D.C., giving D.C. its own musical identity and reminding the Nation that D.C. has always been the hometown of talented artists. Chuck Brown was a strong supporter of D.C. statehood, including playing a concert on a hot and humid day on the U.S. Capitol Grounds in 2010 in support of statehood. Chuck Brown was born on August 22, 1936, and passed away on May 16, 2012. He was a D.C. resident most of his life. He taught himself to play guitar, becoming a virtuoso singer, songwriter, guitarist and band leader. His musical catalogue spanned 22 studio albums over three decades. He earned a Grammy nomination in 2010 for the song ``Love'' from his album ``We Got This,'' and was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellowship in 2005. D.C. named a park located at 2901 20th Street, Northeast, for Chuck Brown, and named a street near the historic Howard Theater for him. I urge my colleagues to support this bill."
The House resumed consideration of the motion.
"Mr Speaker, I am honoured to rise today to present a petition on behalf of petitioners from my riding calling on the government to reject recommendations 429 and 430 of the House of Commons finance committee's pre-budget report, refrain from including these recommendations in the federal budget or any related legislation, and affirm the charitable status of faith-based organizations whose work flows from sincerely held beliefs and whose contributions serve the common good in Canada."
"let's have a candid conversation if we could, sir, with my colleague across the aisle about what is happening here.  Congress and America, we need to clarify for the citizens watching, Mr. Speaker, Congress has a unique authority, and therefore, responsibility for our Nation's Capital as opposed to other municipalities across the country. Why not Phoenix, New Orleans, Atlanta, et cetera? It is because they are not the Nation's Capital, that is why. It is because it is not reflected in the responsibilities that are enumerated for Congress for the District of Columbia, our Nation's Capital. With the pendular swing of majority control that we observe in our Nation, from Democratic majority to Republican majority, my Democratic colleagues feel responsible to make changes when they have the majority, as do we. When we were under Democratic majority control in recent years, since I have been in Congress, the Democrats supported and did not oppose some policy and legislative decisions at the municipal level in our Nation's Capital that we knew would injure our Nation's Capital in the realm of law enforcement. That is where we are. Republicans have majority control in the House, the Senate, and the White House, so of course we are going to respond to the threat that we face within our Nation's Capital toward law enforcement. This is my bill, and this is how simple it is: It requires the District of Columbia to comply with Federal immigration law. What is wrong with that, Mr. Speaker? My colleague stated two or three times in his opening statement that the District of Columbia does not obstruct Federal law enforcement. That is not true.  America has to read between the lines. When he says they do not obstruct, it means they don't, like, physically stop ICE from executing a warrant. What he is not saying, Mr. Speaker, is that the District of Columbia does not comply with Federal immigration law enforcement warrant detainers, which is the safest, most widely accepted means by which a human being that is in the custody of one jurisdictional authority is transferred to another jurisdictional authority safely and within the parameters of the law for the benefit of the individual and the community. D.C. doesn't do that for Federal immigration detainers. If they have somebody in custody, Mr. Speaker, for whatever purposes, and that guy has a warrant for ICE, they know that there is a warrant for that man. Under normal circumstances, the custody of that individual would be transferred safely once the District of Columbia was finished with that individual. They don't do that with ICE. They subject their communities to dangerous circumstances and law enforcement to absolutely unnecessary danger. My bill just mandates that the District of Columbia is the one city that Congress has authority over, and therefore, responsibility to be involved with things like this. We shouldn't have to have this law. Why? Because the District of Columbia should be following the Federal law in the first place. We shouldn't have to bring this to the floor. We shouldn't have to engage in this debate. I shouldn't have to explain these things. However, we are going to, by God, require that our Nation's Capital comply with our Nation's Federal law. I encourage my colleagues to take a deep breath, step back and say, yes, our Nation's Capital will be subject to the very laws that this body passes. I appreciate the chairman's advocacy for my bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support it."
"This is a new topic to me personally. I was contacted by a constituent whose late husband, a good friend of mine, Michael Green, worked for British Coal at the time. He too was passionate that this money should be returned to the miners. Does the Minister agree that we need to get on with this and get this to happen as quickly as possible?"
I declare the motion carried.
"Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure to be here tonight at 11:30 to answer the member's question, and it was great to see us all vote together in this chamber to pass the main estimates tonight. I note that the members opposite have supported a number of pieces of legislation in this House just this week. It is great to see us working together on behalf of Canadians. It is also great to be back in government on behalf of Canadians. My condolences to the members opposite for returning to their rightful place on the opposition benches. Canadians expect us to take bold actions that will drive economic growth, create good-paying jobs and ensure that all Canadians benefit from Canada's incredible talent and ingenuity, our strong free trade agreements already in place and our unique and vast wealth and prosperity. That is exactly what we are doing, and we are doing it with strength, purpose and agility. First, we introduced a middle-class tax cut, a hugely significant investment in Canadians that will put more money in their pockets. There are 22 million Canadians across this county who will get a tax break. Conservatives can complain about that, but that is delivering for Canadians. Second, we will help to further bring down costs for Canadians, especially young people. I take to heart that young people in my riding have said it is hard to purchase their first home. We are removing the GST for first-time homebuyers on new homes valued at $1 million and saving them up to $50,000. We are also lowering the GST for first-time homebuyers on new homes valued between $1 million and $1.5 million. Third, we are honouring a commitment we made. It should very much please the Conservative Party of Canada that we have removed the consumer carbon price from law, effective as of April 1 of this year, as part of our plan to refocus federal carbon pollution pricing standards. We will do all of these things while keeping our industrial carbon tax in place so that Canada can remain aligned with global best practices and continue to build a competitive and more sustainable economy. These three measures send a strong and clear signal to Canadians right across the country that we will remain focused. Our top priority will be them as we build the biggest and fastest-growing economy in the G7. Speaking of priorities, I recognize the federal budget is a critically important financial and democratic document. That said, it is precisely why budget 2025 must be delivered in a logical sequence that takes national and international priorities into account. As Canada forges a new relationship with the United States based on respect and common interest, we must remain hyperfocused on reinforcing Canada's strength at home, safeguarding our workers and businesses, and defending their interests. These discussions are ongoing and vitally important for our shared future. They are also vitally important as we see investments in our defence spending and reaching our NATO target this year. I welcomed the great announcement the Prime Minister made. Of course, in the midst of all of these changes internationally, it is prudent of us to take the time we need to prepare a budget properly. We need the detailed analyses, policy checks and meticulous preparations that budgets always entail. That is, in my view, the proper process for developing a budget. Budgets are not types of documents that should be rushed. I hear my colleagues heckling me. I welcome that because it eggs me on, makes me feel good and actually makes me want to talk even more. We will definitely deliver a budget this fall."
"Madam Speaker, that is also a very good question. We specifically mentioned a target in our election platform. If I am not mistaken, that target was approximately 20% of non-market housing. If this goal were reached, it would lead to a significant number of non-market homes, which could greatly improve the situation and help many people who do not have the same financial means as others. At the moment, the percentage of non-market homes is 3.5%. That is ver low and has no real effect on the rest of the market. The reality is that when there is non-market housing that is protected from speculation, there are people who are able to put a roof over their heads at a reasonable price. When that number becomes high enough, it ends up having an effect on the rest of the market. It leaves people wondering why so many people are able to pay a reasonable price while others take advantage of the situation and charge excessive prices. Something really needs to be done about non-market housing. That is not to say that there is no place at all for the private sector. I think it is also important to respect the initiative of entrepreneurs who want to build housing. However, the government needs to provide a framework and invest to help those who cannot afford housing in the current market."
"during Roll Call No. 162 on H.R. 2096, I mistakenly recorded my vote as YEA when I should have voted NAY."
"The Minister talks about regional growth, but in north-east Scotland we see only cost and decline under this Labour Government. Let us take the oil and gas sector. Labour policies will cost almost 35,000 jobs by the end of this decade, and PS150 billion in economic income by 2050. The UK-EU deal will cost fishermen in Scotland PS6 billion. Two thirds of Scottish farmers will be impacted by the family farm tax, with 48% of farms halting their investments, which again hits the rural businesses that would be supplying them? Can the Minister name a single policy that this Labour Government have introduced that benefits regional growth in north-east Scotland?"
"The Conservative party has always believed in the rights of locally elected councillors and planning committees to make decisions for the people they serve; we have said that consistently through the passage of this Bill. The hon. Member for Taunton and Wellington (Gideon Amos) has tabled new clause 1 to ensure that planning committees have their current powers reinstated under the Government's proposals. The Minister is saying this afternoon, as he will say tomorrow, that he does not trust any planning committee or any Labour-controlled council to make decisions based on the wishes of the constituents in their local areas. We think that that is a disgrace."
"Mr. Speaker, the world is facing geostrategic challenges, and Canada is ready to lead. Canada has what the world wants and the values to which the world aspires. As president of the G7, Canada will leverage our strength to seek new agreement on protecting our communities and the world, building energy security and securing the economic partnerships of the future. The world needs more Canada, and we will deliver."
"Mr. Speaker, I do not understand where the member is going, because if he is trying to say that indigenous people should not be consulted as part of projects, I will say definitively that he is incorrect. Indigenous people must be part of the process and consultation—"
"I totally agree; it really is just not good enough. [Interruption.] I hope the Minister is listening. I urge the Department of Health and Social Care to do all it can to maintain and support NHS Somerset in ensuring the return of safe maternity services to Yeovil district hospital. Just as with the closure of its hyper-acute stroke unit, many worry that this is a sign that Yeovil district hospital will be turned into a cottage hospital. As such, I also ask the Minister to join NHS Somerset integrated care board in committing to maintaining a fully functioning district general hospital in Yeovil that provides safe, high-quality and sustainable services. However, Yeovil is not alone in this: we face a crisis in maternity services, particularly in rural areas. The CQC has raised safety concerns about a lack of training, limited engagement with communities, inadequate risk assessments and poor management and culture among senior leadership. The CQC national review of maternity services in England for 2022-24 found that 47% of maternity services were rated as requiring improvement for safety. As of May 2025, 56% of maternity units in the south-west had an overall rating of ""requires improvement"" or ""inadequate"". Given that, can the Minister detail the Government's plans for funding and improving the provision, management and staffing of maternity services in hospital trusts that cover large rural geographies? Can she provide a timeline for implementing those plans? I again urge her and the Secretary of State to meet with hon. Members from Somerset and Dorset to further discuss this issue and to come to Yeovil and talk to those impacted by this decision. In conclusion, the closure of Yeovil district hospital's maternity unit, initially for six months, was done for the right reasons, but it was done disgracefully. People in Yeovil are not just worried; they are scared and angry. We care deeply about supporting our fantastic NHS  staff and the lifesaving work that they do. Hundreds of people joined me at a rally outside the hospital on the day that the maternity service closed, and many more have written to me. Nearly 6,000 people already have signed petitions calling for the safe return of Yeovil's maternity unit. We will campaign tirelessly to ensure that we can restore local maternity services in Yeovil safely. I hope that the Minister will join us in that battle, because everyone deserves access to safe, local maternity care, regardless of where they live."
"Mr. Speaker, I want to express how disingenuous it is for Canadians to believe that Conservatives do not support tax cuts. Conservatives support tax cuts all the time and everywhere. The issue is always that the Liberal government never goes far enough. There is always a poison pill in the legislation, and we just cannot let these things pass. The Liberals have been very voracious with announcements of their spending promises, but there is just no verifiability without a budget. How is the government planning to fund these expenditures? How is the government going to support this without tabling a budget?"
"I rise to speak in support of new clauses 13 to 15, tabled by the hon. Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater), to support amendments 94 and 95, and to oppose amendment 42. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Spen Valley for her compassionate leadership and immense hard work, to the Members of all views who served on the Bill Committee for their thoughtful and hard work, and to those who have worked behind the scenes to scrutinise the Bill and contribute to the debate. I thank all the constituents who have been in touch with all of us. I am sure that, like me, hon. Members have carefully reflected on those contributions and taken them into account. It is clear that the status quo is not acceptable. That is why it is right that we have this legislation before us, and that we are scrutinising it so carefully and looking at it in such immense detail. Turning to new clause 13, regarding the regulation of substances for use in assisted dying, those substances obviously have to be properly regulated, although it is equally obvious that they cannot be subject to conventional clinical trials in the same way as other medicines, which is why the proposal to make that process go through the MHRA is inappropriate. The regulations provided for in new clause 13 will ensure that that critical part of the process is carried out with the highest possible level of scrutiny and harm prevention. It is essential that there is transparency and assurance of the process, from manufacture all the way through to administration, which is what new clause 13 does."
"Mr. Chair, does the minister agree with experts that a massive spike in immigration to Canada is putting pressure on health care in our country?"
"I totally agree. It is sorry to see that so many of those centres have gone, and we need to invest more. The earlier that children's needs are identified and supported, the more likely they are to succeed. Researchers, for instance at University College London, have already developed a screener that goes far beyond the current phonics screening, and it is really cost-effective. I hope that the Government's schools White Paper, which is due in the autumn, will set out a plan for rolling out such screeners across schools. Once children's needs have been identified at school, we need to ensure that our teachers are fully equipped to help. That is why we urgently need better internal teacher training and continuous professional development for teachers and other education professionals, including teaching assistants and senior staff. We must also ensure that SENCOs are represented on senior leadership teams, and are given dedicated time to do their work properly. I hope that the Minister or the Secretary of State will update us on the progress made on teacher training, and tell us when we can expect those teachers to be rolled out. There can be no better investment in the future of our country than investment in education and young people. Ensuring that everyone has a good-quality education and career always provides a return, as I know from my personal background of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia. I left school having had support, but I was severely bullied, to a point where I was sprayed with deodorant and set alight when I got off the school bus, so I know how vital such support is. Without the support that I was given at school, I would not be here today: I would either be in prison or I would have taken my own life. This is so important--so please, let us get on with universal screening and teacher training for neurodiverse conditions."
"We do indeed, and we are putting in extra funds and greater support to deal with the problem of homeless veterans. I am happy to thank and pay tribute to the Ancre Somme Association for its part in a successful Armed Forces Day parade and celebration in Falkirk. I pay tribute to all the volunteers right across the country who made our local Armed Forces Day events possible. We pay tribute to the regulars, the reservists, the veterans, the cadets and the armed forces families, but it is the volunteers who help us make these events happen."
"Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague on his re-election. I listened very carefully to his speech, which I found to be divisive. However, what I heard during the election campaign was a desire to be more united than ever and to feel close to our fellow Canadians as Quebeckers in order to present a united front against the division sown by the United States. The deeply sovereignist talk from my colleague is not what I heard when knocking on doors. I am a proud Quebecker, born and raised in the Eastern Townships. I went to school in Saguenay. I have lived in the Eastern Townships for almost my entire life. I come from Quebec's regions. I am a proud Quebecker. I ran for the Liberal Party because I believe in its values, in the rule of law, in fairness and in democracy. Like me, 44 of my Quebec colleagues were elected as members of the Liberal Party, twice as many as for the Bloc Québécois. Does my colleague recognize that I am a proud Quebec Liberal and I, too, was elected to represent Quebeckers?"
"Mr. Speaker, the NDP agrees to apply the vote and will be voting in favour of the motion."
"I thank the Minister for his previous response, and I am glad to see that Cornwall's socioeconomic challenges are reflected in the fact that 11 mission priority neighbourhoods have been identified in mid-Cornwall alone. We have talked about funding for mission critical neighbourhoods, but what steps are being taken to ensure that those mission priority neighbourhoods--deprived areas that fall just short of that mission critical definition--get adequate investment, too?"
"Madam Speaker, it is interesting to note that, for two years in the House, the Conservative Party of Canada and its members claimed the consumer carbon price was the only cause, and did not allow for any other factors, of food price inflation. We have now removed the consumer carbon tax, and food prices are still going up, but the Conservatives are still making the same argument, which does not make any sense. The other thing is that we, as a government, have moved forward with an income tax cut worth, on average, $840 a year. The truth is that we understand that Canadians are struggling, but we are the ones in government doing the things that are helping Canadians, driving affordability measures and putting more money in their pockets. We have many examples of that. Just in the last 12 sitting days of the House, we have moved forward on numerous tax cuts and measures that will build a stronger economy. The best way to assure Canadians—"
"today I rise in strong support of my bipartisan bill, the Global Investment in American Jobs Act. Mr. Speaker, this is a critical piece of legislation that will help bolster American competitiveness in the face of increasing economic aggression from the Chinese Communist Party, all while helping to create jobs in my home State of Colorado and all across the Nation. First and foremost, I extend my gratitude to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) for helping to introduce this bill with me. I am proud to work with her in a bipartisan fashion to advance this bill first through the Energy and Commerce Committee and now onto the House floor. In Colorado alone, there are more than 126,000 workers that are the direct result of foreign direct investment. Of these workers, 31 percent work in manufacturing roles. These jobs, like other good, blue- collar jobs in my district, provide stable, good-paying careers to constituents to help provide for their families. Oftentimes, these jobs are obtainable to folks with a high school degree after a quick and affordable career technical education course. My bill tasks the Secretary of Commerce with conducting an interagency review to help create a more favorable environment for foreign direct investment, ultimately boosting our economy and benefiting American workers.  International companies are beginning to recognize what most of us have known for decades. The American worker is among the most talented in the world. Whether it is energy, technology, or chemicals, Americans produce some of the highest quality products in the cleanest, most efficient, and socially responsible ways possible. With the resurgence in America's manufacturing industry, global investors are now clamoring to pump money into emerging industries in the U.S. Congress needs to ensure that we as a Nation are striking the right approach in courting international companies and facilitating responsible investments. This legislation doesn't just help create good-paying jobs. It also helps to ensure that America remains competitive with the Chinese Communist Party by retaining our technological advantage in research and development. International employers in the U.S. account for more than $80 billion in research and development. With this bill, Congress can take a major step in seeing this number increase over the coming years. This isn't just something that we should consider doing. It is necessary. In the face of increasingly unscrupulous tactics from the Chinese Communist Party such as rampant intellectual property theft, corporate espionage, the use of slave labor, and environmentally reckless energy practices, it is imperative for the United States to leverage every available tool to bolster American industry, such as this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Global Investment in American Jobs Act to maintain Americans' competitive edge, invest in our domestic talent, bring more jobs home, and drive innovation to usher in the next era of manufacturing dominance in the United States."
"I declare Motion No. 11 defeated. The question is on Motion No. 15. A vote on this motion also applies to Motions Nos. 21 to 23. If a member participating in person wishes that the motion be carried or carried on division, or if a member of a recognized party participating in person wishes to request a recorded division, I would invite them to rise and indicate it to the Chair."
"Mr. Speaker, the member shared her family's story in the context of this bill. Does she have any other stories she could share, perhaps in a different context, but still related to this bill?"
"I was unavoidably detained due to illness and was unable to cast my vote on Roll Call No. 175. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 175."
"Oh, oh!"
I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).
"In July, I came from the classroom to this Chamber. I have seen the harm that poverty does to children, particularly those from families on universal credit who were not able to claim free school meals, probably because their parents were grafting in low-paid jobs or in insecure work. Does the Minister agree that having 500,000 more children fully entitled to a nutritious school dinner will boost school attendance and help narrow the education gap that widened under the Tories?"
"Madam Speaker, under the Liberals, Canada has become a playground for foreign interference. For years, CSIS, national security experts and diaspora groups have been calling on the Liberals to establish a foreign influence registry to counter foreign interference. Only after the Liberals got caught turning a blind eye to Beijing's interference in our democracy did they finally introduce legislation to establish a registry. It has been a year since the legislation passed. Where is the registry? There is no office established, no commissioner appointed, and no timeline provided. After years of opposing and obstructing a registry, the Liberals' latest tactic appears to be one of endless delay. This is completely inexcusable. It is time for the Liberals to finally take foreign interference seriously and get the registry up and running now."
"I thank my hon. Friend for that important question. The Government are carefully considering the work of the patient safety commissioner and her report, which sets out the options for redress. This is a complex issue involving input from different Government Departments. We will provide a further update on the commissioner's report soon."
"Mr. Speaker, I give notice that, with respect to consideration of Government Business No. 1, at the next sitting of the House, a minister of the Crown shall move, pursuant to Standing Order 57, that debate be not further adjourned."
"I understand the right hon. Gentleman's argument and point of view. He overlooks the fact that the strategic defence review draws on more than 8,000 submissions, which were part of the material on which the reviewers based their recommendations and vision. I simply say to him that we deter those conflicts that have such massive human and economic costs by being strong enough to defeat the adversaries who would do us harm. That is why NATO has been the most successful defence alliance in history over the last 35 years, and that is why we will step up and play a more leading role in NATO for the future."
"Mr. Speaker, the answer is right there in the question. It was indeed a vote-buying handout. I can hardly believe it. During question period, the Prime Minister even said he was proud to have put an end to the carbon tax. He said that the Government of Quebec had its own carbon tax. The Prime Minister himself does not understand the differences between the carbon pricing mechanisms in Canada. Quebec does not have a carbon tax; it has a carbon exchange. I cannot believe it."
I thought we wanted to finish question period on time. The hon. government House leader.
"Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague for her victory. The province of Manitoba set a record last year, in 2024, for homicides. My own city of Hamilton also set a gun crime record. I would like to ask the member, is she willing to vote yes to repeal Liberal Bill C-5 and Bill C-75 and put the teeth back in our justice system so criminals are afraid to commit crimes?"
"Those of us who have come here today to support the Bill do not speak lightly of life and death, as some have accused us: we come here to recognise that this House has a responsibility to draw lines where there are none. Many of us have campaigned for many years, as the Mother of the House, the right hon. Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), said, to give voice to dying people--not because they want to be rescued, but because time and again they are begging us for mercy. It is worth reiterating that this Bill is about not choosing death but how to face death when it is already at the door. It is about that final chapter of life--that short chapter. As many of our constituents have told us time and again, it is a chapter that they write in pain, fear and desperation. We are here today to ask a simple question: in essence, is the law, in those final, often agonising moments, to be a barrier? Are we to be a barrier, or are we here to be a companion, to assist those people to fulfil their dying wishes? I believe in autonomy--I believe in dignity--but, more than that, I believe in compassion governed by care, not chaos. That is what the system lacks. Right now, friends, as the hon. Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater) said, we live with the cruel illusion that doing nothing is neutral. It is not. Those who have objected to the Bill are conspicuous in not saying that they accept the status quo for however long the Bill may take to reappear if it fails. We have heard, again and again, stories of people forced to travel abroad to die in lonely circumstances. We see loving spouses prosecuted for holding the hand of someone they have loved for 50 years. We see lonely suicides in quiet suburban bedrooms: lives ended not because of terminal illness, but because of a lack of legal options. The Bill brings order where there is confusion; it brings safeguards where there is silence; and it replaces secrecy with structure and fear with honesty. Notwithstanding the claims made today and elsewhere, it has been built in the right way. This House has taken its duties seriously, in all its forms of legislation. The Bill has gone through detailed scrutiny in Committee and concerns about coercion, training, eligibility and oversight have been met head on and addressed through carefully considered amendments. The panel model that we have now is shaped by those concerns. To ensure the right expertise, legal oversight and continuous consent checks are in place from beginning to end. This is how Parliament should legislate: carefully, collaboratively and with humility in the face of complexity. To those who worry about coercion, I would say that the greatest risk of coercion is under the status quo. Today there are no checks, no panels, no oversight. We do not know who is choosing freely because there is no system to ask and no conduct to examine. We have heard the argument about a slippery slope, and I would say this. This law is very tightly drawn. There is no constitutional pathway here for expansion by stealth.   Any change would require this House--us--to decide again. It cannot drift. It cannot slide. It is anchored in law and in the authority of this place. To those who talk about misdiagnosis, I say that the Bill requires two independent doctors, clear clinical criteria and a final check at the point of delivery. Even then, the person must still be mentally competent and willing at every step. The answer can be no, but at the last--at last--there will be the possibility of a choice. To those who ask, often movingly, what if the patient lives longer than expected, I would say, ""Good--they live."" This law does not force a single death. It simply allows a dying person to decide when enough is enough. Madam Deputy Speaker, I will finish with this. I have sat with dying friends. I have watched the slow unwinding of bodies that once held vigour, humour and pride. I have seen families trying to honour the unspoken wishes of someone too far gone to speak. Finally, I will say this. We do not honour life by prolonging suffering. We honour life by giving it meaning and power. The one thing that dying people ask for in their agonising final moments is control over the disease that is destroying them. The status quo, my friends, is completely unacceptable. Whatever you think of the Bill, it is indisputable that it is an improvement on what we have now, and I urge you to support it."

"I do not wish to exacerbate your bronchitis, Madam Deputy Speaker, so I will continue. Amendment 15 touches on a fundamental point at the heart of the debate. Disabled people and the sick, in every aspect of their lives, have to fight every day for resources from a state, a market and a society that view them as a drain on finances. Do we honestly believe that at the moment when the most vulnerable are least able to argue for themselves, under the most intense societal and cultural pressure, and at their most expensive, those same public and private sector institutions will succeed in making choice real for them when they have failed to do so throughout the rest of their lives? Even if we stretch credulity and convince ourselves that that will be true in the state sector, can we say that it will be true in the market? I do not believe that the Bill should be passed, but if it is, let us not make it worse by allowing unscrutinised profit from the loss of human beings."
"I declare an interest, as my brother is a GP. When my residents are able to get a GP appointment, they are frustrated when they are sent halfway across the borough to a different surgery from the one they are registered with by their primary care network. Can we address that, and is it part of our proposals in the new GP contract?"
"In the east midlands we have been raging for over a decade against the inequality that has left our region at the very bottom when it comes to spending on transport per person, and it has taken a Labour Government to start to put that right and begin to unlock the economic potential and raise living standards. Would my right hon. Friend agree that this represents a considerable achievement of our Mayor Claire Ward and shows that, after years in the pit stop, the regions are finally being given the green light to grow?"
The hon. member has the floor.
Will the hon. Member give way?
"I thank the hon. Gentleman for his questions and his promise to hold us to account; I look forward to that. He was right to reiterate the point that I made at the beginning about the importance of support for the workers, and we are calling for the company's owners to do the right thing. As for the carbon border adjustment, we have looked at three factors: the UK emissions trading scheme, the carbon leakage risk, and the feasibility and effectiveness of inclusion. The refining sector does not currently meet all those criteria and is therefore not included in scope at present. We are looking beyond 2027 and also considering whether there is more we can do in the short term, but clearly there are questions about carbon leakage and other matters that we need to work through. That is partly why I got those in the sector together--the first time that had happened for 13 years, as it turns out--to talk about some of those issues, and about their own views. I am not going to answer the hon. Gentleman's second question with a specific number, because I do not think that is the right way to look at anything around business planning. What I can say is that refineries are incredibly important to this country. They are crucial parts of our energy infrastructure, and they are important businesses, but businesses have to operate as successful businesses. While some refineries are absolutely doing that, this one is clearly an example of where that has not happened. We will do everything we can to support the sector, but I am not going to put a specific number on how many refineries we should have in the future."
"Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise as the member representing the newly named riding of Central Newfoundland, formerly known as Coast of Bays—Central—Notre Dame. I am truly grateful for those who supported me, put their trust in me and sent me to this place again to bring their thoughts, concerns and worries to this place. I owe a world of gratitude to all those who helped on my campaign. We had a tremendous campaign, and it meant so much to everybody and even more to me. God bless everybody who was involved. I thank them very much. I will continue to speak out on behalf of the people of the riding of Central Newfoundland while I am in Ottawa, in this chamber or on the fisheries committee. I rise today to speak to our Conservative opposition day motion calling on the Liberal government to immediately end its mandate to ban gas-powered vehicle sales in Canada. This is supposed to happen by 2035, when all vehicles sold in Canada are to be zero-emitting, and there are various targets along the way. By 2026, 20% of all vehicles sold in Canada are to be zero-emitting. By 2030, that figure is supposed to go to 60%. Of course, by 2035, it goes all the way up to 100%. Consumers are rejecting EVs for various reasons. There is the fact that they lose 40% of their battery life in cold weather. We have lots of cold weather in Canada, and we certainly have it in Newfoundland and Labrador. That stat is based on the Canadian Automobile Association. They did the test. This is not something we are coming up with off the top of our heads. It is scientifically proven that these batteries cannot take the cold. There is a lack of charging stations. In Newfoundland and Labrador, right now there are only 120 charging stations. Another reason people are choosing to be against electric vehicles is the cost of these vehicles. They cost, on average, $15,000 more than an equivalent gas-powered model. Where do we stand heading into 2026? The latest data from February and March is that only 6.6% of vehicles that were purchased were EVs. In order to get on target for the 20% mark by the end of 2026, EV sales would have to triple what they were in the last recorded months. This is not going to happen. What will be the result of this consumer rejection and of this Liberal plan? The Liberals would charge auto manufacturers that fail to meet this target a $20,000 tax per vehicle. I see my colleague from Winnipeg. He is listening intently because he knows this is the case. Consumers are going to pay the price, and this is exactly what the Prime Minister wants. This is not straying from his mantra. We can go back to 2021, when he wrote a book called Values . I will give a little quote from that book. He said, “A host of other fiscal and regulatory policies can be highly effective in setting out the contours of a net-zero economy, including...regulations to phase out the sale of new internal-combustion vehicles in the next decade”. That is 10 years. That is not a long time. “Fiscal and regulatory policies” is what the Prime Minister stated in his book. Let us unpack that a bit. EVs are a failure in Canada. People do not want them, and as a result, Canadians are going to pay the price. They are going to pay the price for Liberal failures. The government has known for quite some time that this mandate will fail. It has been warned by utility companies that the grid will not stand up to it. Electricity demand will go up by close to 23% by 2035, and the electricity market is governed by supply and demand like every other commodity. With the continued electrification of everything, the price of electricity is going to go up. That will be another inadvertent consequence, with collateral damage to the people of Canada. To have our grid ready with additional power generation, with an upgraded transmission grid and with more charging stations, the cost is forecast to be $300 billion. This is according to the Liberal government's own research, published last July by Natural Resources Canada. The government knows its zero-emissions EV target will not work. Building electricity generation and transmission infrastructure takes time. If we are going to expand our grid by 23% just to have enough electricity to power these vehicles, it is going to take decades to build that kind of infrastructure. What is the Liberal Prime Minister 's real goal? It is to tax Canadians. Canadians will pay the price. They will pay for this doomed plan. Who will also pay for it, besides the consumer? According to the peer-reviewed Canadian Journal of Economics, in the best-case scenario, our auto sector will lose $140 billion by 2035 under these mandates, and the worst-case scenario is that it continues to lose until 2050, at a cost of $1.3 trillion. Can members believe that? It is possible that these EV mandates could cost the automotive industry $1.3 trillion. Job losses in the sector are projected to be 137,000 jobs. That is not my number. The hit to our GDP would be 4.8% nationally per year, and the demand for autos would drop by 10.5%. All of this is to drop our emissions in Canada by a mere 6%. It will cost $3,400 per tonne. That is 20 times the original Trudeau carbon tax nominal rate per tonne. There is no need for this. If consumers think electric vehicles are better, they will choose them. According to the Fraser Institute, “Electric vehicle mandates mean misery all around”. That was the headline out of the Fraser Institute, a very respected organization. It goes on to say, “The latest news of slowing demand for electric vehicles highlight the profound hazards of the federal government’s Soviet-style mandate”. That ums it up. It is a Soviet-style mandate. EV mandates will mean lots of suffering and no freedom."

"I rise to honor the life and legacy of a remarkable daughter of northwest Ohio, Diana ``Dee'' Heywood Talmage. While her passing leaves a deep chasm in our community, Dee was a formidable force for good. She was a Republican, and I am a Democrat. Her patriotism, philanthropy, good sense, and elegance bestowed a living legacy that serves as an example of an exemplary life well lived. Dee embodied the very highest aspirations for northwest Ohio. A product of Toledo's DeVilbiss High School, a proud Ohio State Buckeye, and a Toledo Rocket, she used her education to give back to the community that raised her. Dee served on the Ottawa Hills School Board, the boards of Owens Community College and Woodlawn Cemetery, and helped guide the University of Toledo Alumni Association. Dee always led with vision, clarity, courage, and compassion, and her inspired leadership drew from all walks of life to make a difference. She mentored generations of new leaders, many of whom sit on boards, serve in office, or volunteer today because of her example. To observe Dee barreling down the street in her convertible, broadly smiling and waving, was to feel the heart of Toledo itself. Her love for our people, progress, and potential was boundless, and her life was not just one of service but of joyful commitment to her family--I will put their names in the record at a later time--including her beloved husband of 63 years, Brigadier General Dr. Lance Talmage, a dedicated community and military leader alongside her. May Dee's legacy of character and commitment continue to inspire generations to come. She surely will be missed. She was one of a kind."
"I will not, if that is okay. We were told that it was not practical to produce such an assessment until after Committee stage, as it would be necessary to assess the impact of amendments made in Committee. The equality impact assessment was finally published five weeks ago. I have to say that I was pretty astounded. It does not recognise that certain groups in this country may have their lives prematurely shortened as a result of this legislation; instead, it concerns itself with the barriers that vulnerable people may face when trying to access assisted dying. I find that astonishing. Did the people who drafted the assessment not hear the speech of the hon. Member for Vauxhall and Camberwell Green (Florence Eshalomi) on Second Reading? She spoke with passion about how the underlying inequalities in access to healthcare experienced by those from black and minority ethnic backgrounds would be exacerbated if the Bill passed unamended. Did they not listen to the oral evidence that Dr Jamilla Hussain gave to the Bill Committee? She talked about her experience of working   with racialised communities in Bradford and their fears of being pushed disproportionately towards an assisted dying pathway. Did they not listen to the testimony of Dr Miro Griffiths on the experience and concerns  of disabled people--testimony that has been echoed  by Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson and the actress  Liz Carr? I find it inexplicable that the framing of the impact on vulnerable people should be the removal of barriers to accessing assisted dying and not, as it should be, the increased risk to their health and wellbeing that the Bill presents. I am concerned that we are thinking about the impact on vulnerable people solely with reference to those who are suffering a terminal illness with less than six months to live. We are not thinking about the impact on wider society of introducing a concept of lives not being worth living and how that might disproportionately affect our more vulnerable communities. My new clause 19 and consequential new schedule 2 and amendment 88 seek to ensure that a comprehensive range of statistics are collected about those who seek and receive an assisted death, so that proper and complete monitoring of requests can be carried out. It is imperative that we get the most detailed possible picture of who is requesting an assisted death so that any patterns of disproportionality can be properly detected and addressed."

"I agree entirely with the hon. Member. It would not be a free choice if we make that choice now, given the standard of palliative care."

"My hon. Friend is making an incredibly powerful speech. Does she share not just my tribute to Amelia Gentleman for the work she did to uncover what happened with the Windrush scandal, as well as people like Colin McFarlane and the Justice 4 Windrush Generation campaign, but my horror at the evidence we have seen this week that  those given compensation to date have not actually been given the same amounts as those in other comparable scandals?

"I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for raising this important matter. On a more serious note, I offer my deepest condolences to two people who lost their lives in a road accident in Reading recently, although I do not want to comment on that because it is under police investigation. I commend my hon. Friend for the work that he is doing. Many smaller unitary local authorities, such as the borough council in my town, have a great deal of local knowledge, yet they are often held back because they are unable to enforce traffic offences, such as speeding, even when 20 mile per hour zones or other zones have been introduced. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing Southall (Deirdre Costigan) said, it would be wonderful if that power could be delegated to them rather than to the police, who are very busy?"

"this year, I received a letter from Rachel, a mother in my district with stage IV lung cancer who is living on borrowed time. She is depending on future innovation driven by NIH research to see her son grow up. Her words are more powerful than mine, so I will read them directly. ``I could write endless words about how many will be devastated by these funding cuts, but this is not that kind of letter. Despite my generous nature, cancer has taught me to be selfish. ``Every single day, I think about my mortality. How long do I have left? Is that shoulder pain or something else? Will I be alive to see my son graduate from high school? He turned 11 [in February], and I made him a lemon cake. ``NIH funding cuts will no doubt shorten my life. There is no truth about which I have ever been more certain.'' Mr. Speaker, our constituents are literally begging for their lives. As a physician and mother, I cannot speak enough about the harm that this bill, this cut to NIH funding, will do. I understand the importance of NIH funding because that is the driver of innovation and scientific discovery. To my Republican colleagues, now is the time to show courage. Stop these cuts to the NIH. Do not undermine scientific innovation. To Rachel, I will fight for you with everything I have. You deserve to see your son graduate."
"As a constituency MP--I represent Manchester Central--I am well aware that parking charges in local communities cause a great deal of contention among our constituents. I am not sure about the reasons behind that decision in Ilkley, but local authorities are balancing the needs of a range of different residents on these matters. It would make a popular topic for a well-subscribed debate."
"Mr. Speaker, I commend the member for Peterborough for her speech. It is mind-boggling to hear the Liberals claiming that they are a new government with a new vision and a new management approach. All of a sudden, they see the merit of properly managing public funds. Let us consider, for example, the CBSA assessment and revenue management system, or CARM, the Phoenix pay system and the long-gun registry, or we can go back even further to the sponsorship scandal. In each of those situations, the Liberals said that they truly acknowledged the situation, that they would do better and that they would be more rigorous, but there is no evidence to show that such is the case. Even the Auditor General said in her report that she would not be adding any further recommendations because the government has been unable to implement the ones it has already received. Let us be serious. What does the member think are the chances that the government will be able to recover even one penny of the amounts it paid to GC Strategies?"
"If the book that the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Alan Gemmell) has written is a political thriller about fighting for small business, I am sure it features five heroes on the Government Front Bench doing everything  they can to promote small business. But readers will ask, ""Who is the villain of the piece?"" Is it not obvious that it is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is doing everything possible to undermine business, with 276,000 people having lost work since the autumn statement, and 109,000 in the month of May alone? When will the Ministers--the heroes of this story--fight against the Chancellor, who is getting so much so wrong?"
"Mr. Chair, can the minister tell this House how long it will take for his department to create this new federal agency that will be a developer?"
"Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to enter into debate on the throne speech. I was not anticipating that I would get to speak until tomorrow, but nonetheless, the opportunity arose, and I am at the ready. Looking at the throne speech, the real question is, what is not in the throne speech. More to the point, when I was out campaigning, when I was talking to people in Vancouver East, there were many issues that people raised. Yes, of course, people were talking about their concern with respect to the United States and what was going on with the United States. With that being said, though, while people said we should absolutely take action together in dealing with the United States, they also said that there is another element of the threat that Canada faces, and that is foreign interference. It is a mystery to me how it is that, since the election, we have not heard the Prime Minister raise the issue of foreign interference, the threat to our democratic institutions and our democracy. That is one thing that we must also stand together to protect as well, which we have not seen. The foreign interference registry was something that all members of the previous Parliament, across party lines, worked together to expedite. To date, that act has not yet been enacted. We still do not have the registry up and running, so I do have a question for the government with respect to it: Why has it not been enacted, and where is it? I want to turn to other areas absent in the throne speech, and concerns have already been raised. Seniors and their concerns were not mentioned in the throne speech. Women, for example, were not mentioned in the throne speech. Issues surrounding the impact of gender equality were not addressed in the throne speech. People with different abilities were not mentioned in the throne speech. I was absolutely dismayed with respect to housing. There were two aspects that the government highlighted around housing, such as the GST tax break for first-time homebuyers. That was something that the NDP had pushed for and called for. It is good it is in there, but I should note that there is a major difference in the housing costs in the Lower Mainland. The cap put in place is not going to help a lot of people there. The government also put in a piece about development cost levies and reducing them by half. Reducing development cost levies by half would mean that local governments that need the resources to build the infrastructure would not have that resource. That is still top of mind. In fact, the FCM was here last week and over the weekend. Today I ran into some of the councillors who were still in Ottawa, and they want answers. They want to know how the government is going to address the gap that will be created with the reduction of the development cost levies for the development of housing. That is a major concern for people in the community and local councillors. They do not know how they are going to make that up. Of course, there are other infrastructure needs that are not being met as well, especially with the growing populations of communities. They were not mentioned in the throne speech. I should note that, on housing, renters were not mentioned. It is such a bizarre thing to me. Renters are a large part of our communities and our population. Renters and their concerns were not mentioned in the throne speech. The issues that brought us to the housing crisis were the cancellation of the co-op housing program by the Progressive Conservatives in 1992 and the cancellation of the national affordable housing program by the federal Liberal government in 1993, yet a national affordable housing program and a national co-op housing program are not mentioned in the throne speech. There is no mention of needing to invest in building social housing and co-op housing in Canada. There is no mention of the subsidies that are required to make sure that the non-profit sector has the resources it needs to manage these buildings and keep rents affordable. I do not get it. We have a new Minister of Housing . In his first interview with the media, he said that affordability in the housing crisis is not an issue. How is affordability not an issue in the housing crisis we are faced with when affordability is the number one issue? Last year, the FCM posted that, yes, we need to have more stock, but having more stock alone would not resolve the issue. What we need is affordability, and what that means is that we need the federal government at the table providing resources, both on the capital side in the development of social housing and on the management and operating side. Canada's affordable housing stock is sitting at below 4%, compared to at least 7% in other G7 countries. The countries that are doing well, where they do not have an affordability housing crisis, are at 20%. I know Pierre Poilievre thinks that community housing is somehow Soviet-style housing. I hope the Liberals do not think that. I hope they will counter that narrative and say that Canada will invest in social and co-op housing and that Canada will bring back subsidies to reduce the cost of housing. There is a whole spectrum of need with respect to housing. There are those who are unhoused, those who are low-income renters who need subsidized housing, those who need low-income market rental, those who need some support with a moderate income in the market and those who want to get into the market for the first time to own their own home. For people who want to get into the market to own their own home for the first time, they need the government to address housing profiteering. Those are the actors who come in to evict people so they can jack up the rent because their number one goal is to maximize profit. They are not thinking about how to keep rent low or housing costs low. They are thinking about how to stuff their pockets and how to get the most return for their investment. Therefore, we need to address the financialization of housing, and there is nothing in the throne speech that speaks to that. I would like to move an amendment to the amendment because I think the other part that needs to be dealt with is the issue of indigenous rights. To that end, I move: That the amendment be amended by adding the following: “, as well as Indigenous peoples”."
"Mr. Speaker, after 10 years of the Liberal government, Canada is barely recognizable. We used to be a country where seniors could walk to the park in peace and where parents could let their kids walk to school safely, but not anymore. Just yesterday, York Regional Police executed 15 search warrants in Richmond Hill and neighbouring communities against criminal organizations. Twenty-three people were arrested, with over 300 charges laid and 32 illegal firearms seized, and 700,000 doses of fentanyl, enough to kill a city, were found. In another case from the Toronto Police Service, 10 criminals were arrested after a mass shooting on March 7, multiple guns were seized and 200 criminal charges were laid, including 24 counts of murder. This is what happens when the Liberals govern with ideology instead of common sense. It is time to punish organized crime, stop the flow of deadly drugs going across our borders, keep criminals behind bars and bring home safety to our streets. Enough is enough. The Liberal government needs to stop handcuffing our police officers and finally start handcuffing the criminals and keeping them in jail."
"Mr. Speaker, I was listening to my colleague's speech. I agree with a lot of the things she said. I listened to what our colleague from Winnipeg North said. He seemed to be staunchly defending Pierre Poilievre for not tabling figures, for not critiquing or looking at budgets, for believing that it would be all right to spend tens or hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars without drafting a budget or making any calculations ahead of time, and for telling voters that even though he wanted to lower taxes and increase spending, everything would balance out. That seems a bit strange to me. I remember the first thing I taught my children when they were very young. When they wanted to spend money on chewing gum or toys, the first thing I would ask them was how much money they had before they decided to spend it. I made them count their money. I encourage our Prime Minister and all Liberal Party members to do the same."
"Mr. Speaker, my colleague mentioned that we are a government of action. I would like to know how he sees the tax cut, the program to help children get food in their school and the reduction in the cost of child care. How is all of this going to help Canadians deal with the challenges they are facing today?"
The hon. member has the floor.
"Mr. Speaker, members will remember that, during the campaign, the Prime Minister promised that he had a plan ready to go, that “a plan beats no plan”. I ask this: Where is the plan? By the way, I also want to split my time. I have read arguments in some media against providing that plan, and none of them are compelling or convincing. What is interesting is that, in my reading, I discovered that the three longest times between budgets were during World War II, during COVID and in 2001. Do members know what I found out? All three of those periods were under Liberal governments. As I explained at the beginning of my speech, a budget is a plan. It is a direction. It is a path forward that reveals and expresses what is important. As we heard from the National Post's assessment, right now, it appears that there is no intention of ever balancing the budget. Let us ask that question: Why does rising government debt matter? According to Jay Goldberg in the Winnipeg Sun, “[multiple] studies have shown that an increasing debt-to-GDP ratio puts upward pressure on long-term interest rates, raising borrowing costs for [individuals, families and] governments”, all leading to an increased tax burden for families and the middle class, and creating “barriers to economic growth.” The truth is that Liberal deficit spending also leads to higher prices at the grocery store. A recent Parliamentary Budget Officer report says the cost of servicing public debt, while currently sitting at $49.1 billion for 2025-26, will rise to just under $70 billion in the 2029-30 fiscal year. That means that, just to carry increased debt, we would be paying $70 billion in interest on our debt alone. Members can imagine what we could be doing with $70 billion, but it is going to go to paying the interest on today's spending. We may recall that the Prime Minister said that we would judge him by the price Canadians pay at the grocery store. That being the case, let us look at some of those price increases for just this year to date. Beef is up 34%. Oranges are up 26%. Apples are up 18%. White rice is up 14%. Sweet potatoes are up 12%. Beef rib cuts are up almost 12%. Coffee is up 9%. Infant formula is up 9%. Meatless burgers, although I do not know who would eat those, are up 6%. Chicken breasts are up 6%. Pork rib cuts are up 6%. Pork shoulders are up 5%. Eggs are up 3.6%. I find it very interesting that our supply management food processors have had the least increase. What is concerning is that the most significant increases are in the meat category, the protein that we all so desperately need, with 4% to 34% increases right across the board. Canadians are going to pay almost $17,000 on food this year alone, an increase of $800 from last year, all while two million Canadians visit the food bank each and every month. How can Canadians afford this? Statistics Canada, in its latest report, looked at the annual income in Canada. The latest information shows that the median household income in our country in 2025 will be $68,400. If we take 30% off of that in taxes, that leaves us with $47,000. In other words, over one-third of a family's after-tax income will go to food alone. We heard in the House today that the cost of living in Ontario averages 52% of household income. That leaves a whopping 13% of a family's income for everything else, including transportation, clothing, entertainment and miscellaneous. Canadians need more than elbows up. We need to get our elbows down and get to work. The Prime Minister said that he would collect $20 billion from the United States through tariffs, yet tariffs are, in effect, at zero for products coming from the United States. Only weeks ago, we were assured that there would be no more tariffs supplied to Canada, yet here we are. We are now facing a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum. With Canada being the world's fourth largest aluminum producer and top aluminum exporter, this is concerning. In Canada, we produce approximately 3.3 million tonnes of aluminum every year, and all the projections say that production will increase. Demand is expected to increase by as much as 40% in the next five years. Aluminum mining supports 9,500 direct jobs and 20,000 indirect jobs. When we translate those numbers into the impact on working Canadians, in Canada, we are talking about 30,000-plus jobs that are going to be affected by these tariffs. A 50% tariff was very alarming as the United States was Canada's largest export destination for a aluminum products, which accounted for 92% of total aluminum exports. From what we see, plans continue all around us. For example, I wonder which countries Canada may be talking to regarding the purchase of our raw materials. How are those conversations going? When the President of the United States returned from a recent trip to the Middle East, he announced, upon his return, hundreds of billions of dollars in trade. According to the presidential announcements, the EGA plans to build a $4-billion plant in Oklahoma next year. That smelter will have the capacity to produce as much as 600,000 tonnes a year of primarily aluminum. This will almost double the production of aluminum in the United States. We cannot be led by these promises without seeing the plan forward. I remember very recently we kept hearing our friends on the other side recite that we needed to take their word for it, as they repeatedly claimed that the carbon tax was not causing inflation. Meanwhile, the Parliamentary Budget Officer explained that the total cumulative effect of the carbon tax, even after the rebates, meant that most families were paying more. All the while, we kept saying, when we tax the farmer who grows the food, the trucker who transports it, the store that sells it and the family who buys it, prices will inevitably go up. Then, as soon as the Liberal government finally heeded the Conservative plea to remove the carbon tax, Statistics Canada announced that the decrease in inflation was directly related to the removal of the carbon tax. The very next month, inflation went down from 2.3% to 1.7% in one month. To wrap it up, the Liberals need to take a lesson from our common-sense advice. I invite them to consider the wisdom of our opposition motion. Canadians are depending on a plan that shows them the way forward."
"I thank the hon. Member for that really important question. There are two pieces that I would highlight. The first is the armed forces career transition partnership, which helps individuals during the two years prior to their leaving the service, and for two years after, to find jobs. The second is Operation Ascend, which looks to partner career opportunities and businesses--of which we have engaged with over 400--with any veteran or individual leaving the armed forces, which has engaged with 3,000 individuals. Part of our veterans strategy will include that from a women's perspective. We are doing everything we can, and over 86% of veterans who seek help go straight into employment within the first six months."
"This announcement to extend free school meals will be hugely welcome news to the families of the 4,300 children in Northwich, Winsford and Middlewich that are in receipt of universal credit. There is a wealth of evidence that good nutrition at school has a significant impact on educational attainment, health and wellbeing and long-term earnings potential. If we are serious about bearing down on the rising levels of child poverty, which are now just short of 30% in my constituency, that starts with measures such as this, which I am sure will be the first of many. Does the Minister agree that this change in eligibility presents an opportunity at a national level to improve data sharing with local authorities so that we can finally facilitate auto-enrolment and ensure that the maximum number of families benefit from this policy?"
"Further escalation in the middle east could have devastating consequences, not only for the region but for global stability. Given the provocative and inflammatory rhetoric from President Trump and the risk of unpredictable US action further destabilising the situation, can the Foreign Secretary set out what steps the Government are taking to work with international partners to de-escalate tensions and protect UK interests? Can he also give a definitive answer to the question of UK involvement?"
"The announcements today are all within the envelope that I already set out through the tax increases and the changes to the fiscal rules in autumn and then the decisions in the spring statement. All we have done today is allocate the envelope that we already set out. As I said at the time, public services would now need to live within the means that we have set at that Budget. This statement does not spend a single penny more or a single penny less than the money that was already allocated. On the specific issue the right hon. Gentleman raises, I am very happy to pass on what he says to the Northern Ireland Secretary and to ensure that there is a meeting between the relevant Minister and the relevant Members of Parliament."
I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota.
The House resumed consideration of the motion.
"Mr. Chair, could the minister point to where I would find that out in the estimates, please?"
"The call for an independent investigation began with the UN Secretary-General, given, as I said earlier, his concerns about aid provision. The UK supports the vital humanitarian role of the UN, and that is why we have echoed his calls. On the question of the trade envoy's visit, let me be clear that we suspended negotiations on a future free trade agreement with Israel, but we did not suspend all trade with Israel, as I think the House knows. The trade envoy had no scheduled meetings with Israeli officials, but made his visit as part of his regular duties, because trade continues between Israel and the UK. I am not sure it is entirely fair to link the visit of a trade envoy with the horrific events at aid distribution centres in recent days."
The hon. member.
"I rise to speak to my amendment 134, which seeks to address a long-standing and deeply entrenched failure in our planning system: the chronic undersupply of Gypsy and Traveller sites across England. My amendment seeks to increase fairness in the system and to enable, rather than hinder, the provision of adequate, culturally appropriate accommodation for Gypsy and Traveller communities. For too long the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers have been overlooked by the planning system. Research by Friends, Families and Travellers and Dr Simon Ruston looked at 100 local planning authorities and found that site provision has barely changed since the legal duty to provide them was scrapped in 1994. Of the 149 public sites in those areas, 119 were built before 1994, meaning that just 30 have been developed in the past 30 years--that is only 30 new sites across all 100 local authorities in three decades. Decisions on Gypsy and Traveller sites have frequently been underpinned by prejudice, whether overt or institutional. Too often, proposed developments are blocked or delayed by local opposition that is not met with political will or leadership. Site delivery also suffers from a lack of inclusion at the strategic planning level, where Gypsy and Traveller site provision can be absent from local plans and excluded from land allocations. This absence is not an accident; it is the result of years  of structural marginalisation that the Bill must now correct. I acknowledge the positive steps that the Government took in 2024, which work toward addressing some of those failures. However, we must go further if we intend to support provision and address inequality in the planning system. We have seen an increase in private sites, which is welcome, but we often hear about the long, drawn-out, difficult and expensive processes that individual families go through to achieve planning permission. It is crucial to acknowledge that, just as with other communities, home and land ownership is not within reach of many and social provision is much needed. We are still seeing a troubling trend: the number of socially rented pitches is declining. According to the Traveller caravan count live tables, the number of socially rented pitches has fallen in the past five years, with a reduction of 179 pitches. My amendment would ensure that Gypsy and Traveller accommodation needs are explicitly included in strategic planning, which means embedding the site provision in the spatial development strategies under proposed new section 12D to the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. Those new strategies would help to shape housing across whole regions. Leaving out Gypsy and Traveller sites would repeat the mistakes of the past. Other key planning changes need to be addressed in this Bill, but I will speak with the all-party parliamentary group for Gypsies, Travellers and Roma in due course. Finally, I remind the House that the Government have committed to delivering 1.5 million new homes by 2029. If that ambition is to be truly inclusive, it must include everyone. That means making space--literally and politically--for communities that have been moved on, fenced off and forgotten. I urge the Government to consider these amendments at a later stage, not just for the sake of legislative clarity, but for the future of Gypsies and Travellers across the country."
"Labour is delivering a new era of high and rising school standards, because we know that when standards slip it is disadvantaged children who suffer, and we will not let that happen. That is why Labour's regional improvement for standards and excellence teams are spearheading a stronger, faster system, prioritising stuck schools, sending in advisers with a proven track record of turning schools around, and backing that up with up to PS20 million--"
"My constituents in Tenbury Wells are seeking funding for a flood defence scheme. They will have listened very closely to the Chancellor's remarks today to hear her mention flood defence capital spending, yet it was not mentioned in her speech. Can she confirm that the capital that will be allocated in the spending review period to flood defences will be as high in real terms as it was in the previous Parliament?"
"Mr. Speaker, our colleague evidently read the article that was on the front page of National Newswatch yesterday, but he did not read it closely. What he would have seen if he had is that the issue is squarely in the provincial jurisdiction. We know there are American doctors trying to come to Canada, who are leaving the United States. Of course our health care system is in need of more doctors, but the issue is tangled in bureaucracy in British Columbia. If the member wants to bring matters to the House of Commons, that is fine; it is a very good issue to raise, but the issue is misplaced. It is an issue of provincial jurisdiction."
Indeed they are not. We need to restore trust and deliver meaningful change for all of those who serve.
"The postponed French-Saudi conference on a two-state solution may take place as early as next month. Does the Minister think it will provide the significant opportunity that he seeks for us to recognise Palestine as a state, alongside UK allies?"
"Mr. Speaker, I will quote the Prime Minister , who said that Canada must be an energy superpower that builds low-risk, low-cost, low-carbon energy. That is what we will do."
"We have three debates on each day, and I hope that we will be able to get a good debate on each of those subjects. On Thursday 3 July, there will be  a debate on a motion on financial redress for 1950s women impacted by the Department for Work and Pensions' maladministration of the state pension, followed by a debate on mobile phone theft, a subject that is raised frequently in this Chamber. On Thursday 10 July, there will be a debate on children's health, and we are awaiting acceptance of the other debate. I understand that the sponsor of the debate on Down syndrome that was due to take place this afternoon in Westminster Hall has withdrawn that application because no Minister was available to answer it, so there will be no debate. I hope that you, Mr Speaker, will use your good offices to make sure that that debate takes place, for the benefit of the sponsor and, indeed, the subject. Next week in Westminster Hall, there will be a debate on Tuesday on the right to maintain contact in care settings. On Thursday, there will be a debate on the role of the RAF photographic reconnaissance unit during the second world war, followed by a debate on the BBC World Service. On Thursday 3 July, there will be a debate on the future of music education, followed by a debate on safeguarding children with allergies at school. The following week, on 8 July, there will be a debate on alcohol and cancer--which is a very topical subject during that week--and on Thursday, there will be a debate on state support for victims of terrorism, followed by a debate on London's contribution to the national economy. Not only is Saturday the longest day, but it is also International Yoga Day, and we are giving right hon. and hon. Members the opportunity to practise yoga this afternoon. Those Members who are not in the Chamber or Westminster Hall can come along to Committee Room 10. I guarantee to provide a place for every single Member who comes along, so that we can practise yoga, which is India's gift to the world and is helpful when it comes to having a healthy and a long life."
Call in the members. And the bells having rung:
"On that specific point, will the Minister give way?"
"Mr. Speaker, I would even invite my colleague to give my number to this Beauce business owner. I would very much like to speak with him. I recently hosted Beauce residents who thanked me for being there for them, for defending them and for providing liquidity to industry. These are tangible ways to help people in Beauce and across Quebec and Canada defend themselves against these unjustified, unfair and illegal tariffs. Our industries know that we will always be there for them and for workers."
Point of order.
"The Minister referred to the joint statement with France and Canada on 20 May. Things have got worse since that point. Food distribution has been blocked entirely, hunger is being used as a weapon and innocent Palestinians are paying the price. If that statement is to hold up, will the Minister say what action he will be taking with France and Canada?"
Agreed.
"Madam Speaker, for 10 years, the Liberals have relentlessly targeted law-abiding firearms owners, hunters and sport shooters while letting gun smugglers and criminals off the hook. Now the Prime Minister has pledged to reinvigorate Justin Trudeau's gun-grab program. The government's main estimates show the Liberals will spend four times more targeting legal gun owners than fighting gun crime in our cities. This is not about public safety. It is political theatre designed to appease ideologues who have never held a firearm and do not understand responsible firearm ownership. This includes the public safety minister . As the member of Parliament for Saint John—St. Croix, I will vote against these measures, work to protect communities and stand with law-abiding firearms owners across the country. Common sense, not ideology, must guide our public safety laws. It is time to bring jail, not bail for criminals and stop the crime."
"Apparently, the minister is not here to talk about anything, Mr. Chair, but I will try again. In 2023-24, the Public Service Commission annual report said there was a 3% increase in the federal public service. The Canadian population grew by 1.8% in 2024. Does the minister think it is normal and justifiable that the federal public service is outpacing population growth?"
"I recognise the concern of many constituents across the country, including in the hon. Lady's constituency. We are obviously in close touch with our counterparts. I was talking to my Spanish counterpart on Sunday, and at the Madrid conference I was with my Irish counterparts, and those from the other nations the hon. Lady mentions--and from a whole set of states--that have recognised a Palestinian state. I recognise the desire right across this House, I think, for further steps in that area. Whatever we do, I am sure that this House will press me on the continued horrors in Gaza. In everything we do, we are focused on trying to make an impact on the scenes that our constituents are seeing. We are considering these matters, but we are focused on trying to reduce the suffering in Gaza today."
"Mr. Speaker, we used to hear in the House that sunshine was the best medicine. We do not hear that anymore, do we? No, what we are hearing now is, “I have a plan. Trust me.” There is no plan. The plan should be the budget. If we had a budget, we would know what we were doing. When it comes to trade negotiations with the United States, we are kept in the dark instead of collaborating. The team Canada approach is what we heard so much about during the campaign. There is no team Canada. There is only “elbows up”, now get those elbows down and get back to work."
"Mr. Speaker, was GC Strategies awarded any contracts respecting the CBSA's new e-commerce platform, the e-commerce low value inspection system?"
"There are significant concerns regarding the potential job losses at Spirit AeroSystems that stem from the deal with Airbus. Will the Prime Minister intervene to bring all the main players--the unions, the Business Secretary and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland--around the table to ensure that these jobs are protected, especially considering that the scale of the issue is akin to the challenges faced by British Steel? There is also an issue for Northern Ireland businesses with the outworkings of the Northern Ireland protocol and the Windsor framework. Can the Prime Minister give me reassurances that he is working to resolve all those issues?"
"That was obviously an appalling crime --I remember it very well--but I do not think it has anything to do with what I am saying in this debate. In a free and pluralistic society, we have to be free to criticise ideas. There are laws to protect people, but we cannot have laws that protect ideas from scrutiny or criticism. However, the Government are pressing on with their work on Islamophobia. Only this week, on the very day that Baroness Casey said that the rape gangs were often not prosecuted because of the ethnicity of the perpetrators, Ministers launched a consultation on the new Islamophobia definition. That consultation is open only to carefully selected, invited organisations; it will last for only four weeks; and it allows contributors to remain anonymous. In other words, as lots of people have put it to me, it is rigged, and that is completely unacceptable. Parliament repealed blasphemy laws years ago, and trials for blasphemy had stopped many decades back in any case, but they are with us once more. Parliament must act to restore our freedom of expression."
"Madam Chair, I am not in the job of guessing. I will let the member guess in front of Canadian viewers tonight if he wants to make projections."
"Mr. Speaker, the oil and gas industry is critical to Newfoundland and Labrador, making up 25% of our GDP and 41% of our exports. The province has targets to double oil and gas production and create thousands of good-paying jobs, but energy companies have made it clear that they will not invest while the Liberals' no new pipelines law, Bill C-69 , as well as the oil and gas production cap, and the punishing industrial carbon tax, remain on the books. Does the Prime Minister not realize that no one will build a pipeline under his anti-energy laws, or is it the plan to keep Canadian oil and gas in the ground?"
"Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague is a quick study, with a booming voice, so I think he is going to do just fine in this place. Unfortunately, he will come to learn that, yes, this is far too regular. It does not have to be, but under this current old corrupt Liberal government that we have had for 10 years, it has become far too regular. I will go back to what I said earlier. The numbness that the average Canadian feels inside is because they are just so accustomed to scandals. They have become accustomed to waste, and that is why I think it is imperative, at least for the opposition parties and what should be the governing party, to step up and say that, especially for a new government, this is not okay. The Auditor General highlighted complete failures, flaws and wasted money. We can, we should and we must do better."
"I rise today in strong support of the Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel merger brokered by President Trump to ensure that a critical American company remains right at home in Pennsylvania. By ensuring that U.S. Steel retains an American CEO, an American- dominated board, and allows the U.S. Government to have veto power over critical business decisions, President Donald J. Trump has fully protected our national security. This merger will be a huge benefit for the Pennsylvania economy and for our workers, as it not only includes a massive investment in U.S. Steel's operations already present in Pennsylvania but also includes up to $4 billion for a new steel mill, creating thousands of additional jobs. President Trump stepped up to the plate to protect a critical American company. Mr. Speaker, because of his leadership, the Pennsylvania economy and our Nation that depends on steel production will once again see another example of the golden age of America developing right in front of our eyes.  Supporting Fentanyl Legislation"
"As a former teacher, school governor and university lecturer, and as chair of the all-party parliamentary groups on schools, learning and assessment, on classics and on social mobility, may I say how proud I am to stand here as a Labour MP elected on a manifesto commitment to break down barriers to opportunity for all young people? Bracknell Forest is an incredible place in which to grow up. We have only good and outstanding schools and a fantastic local FE college--Bracknell and Wokingham college--and leafy Berkshire is of course a very lovely corner of the world. However, it would be wrong to suggest that young people in my constituency do not face real challenges. The Sutton Trust has identified that Bracknell has below average social mobility. We have a below average number of 18-year-olds going on to higher education, and the figure is half the rate of Wokingham next door. We are one of the councils in the safety valve programme, and we are facing sustained issues in offering the vital SEND education that is so badly needed. That is why I am so proud that this Government are working to address these educational inequalities, including giving hard-working teachers in my constituency above inflation pay rises for a second year in a row; addressing school support staff funding through re-establishing the school support staff negotiating body; extending free school meals, with over 3,000 students set to be eligible in Bracknell Forest; and the funding to support Uplands school to open a new school-based nursery. What a difference from the Tory party, which would prefer to fund a tax cut for private schools, and the Reform leader, the hon. Member for Clacton (Nigel Farage), who believes SEND students are being massively over-diagnosed. The SEND crisis demands real action to address it, which is why I particularly welcome the PS1 billion extra for SEND in last year's Budget, including PS2.2 million more for Bracknell Forest council to expand provision. I have seen the effect of expanding provision, and I was very proud to open the new special resource provision at Sandhurst school just the other week. However, we need a full range of provision, with mainstream support as well as new special schools, and the Minister will know that I have been lobbying her hard to deliver the proposed special school for autism in Buckler's Park in my patch. Shamefully, the previous Government promised that school, but without a penny to pay for it. I would like to take this opportunity to once again lobby my hon. Friend to deliver that much-needed service."
"Mr. Speaker, I just want to ask the finance minister why he believes that he should spend time at the Bilderberg Meeting rather than actually tabling a budget."
"My hon. Friend talks about community policing and getting police officers back into the community, so does he support my new clause 157, which seeks to streamline the way police case files are prepared and submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service? It is a common-sense approach that would reduce red tape and, most importantly, get police back out supporting victims and building the community trust that they need?"
"Madam Speaker, I would add that I think the biggest threat to the Canadian economy is the Liberal government, because it put in place bills that are continuing to kill our energy industry, such as Bill C-69 , the “no new pipelines“ bill; Bill C-48 , the tanker ban; the oil and gas cap, which, according to Deloitte, will kill around 110,000 jobs here in Canada; and this industrial carbon tax. We need to get rid of that, too. I fully agree with the member. If the Liberals wanted to steal some of our ideas, why not just take all of them and let us get this country back on track to make it an energy superpower, like it once was?"
Absolutely. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Social Security and Disability and I met carers' organisations and many other disability organisations the day after we published the Green Paper. I want to be crystal clear: people who are currently on PIP and are on PIP by the time these changes come in--November 2026 --will remain on that benefit under those old rules.
"Order. The shadow Minister will know that we are debating the amendments that have been selected today, on development corporations and compulsory purchase. Perhaps his final minute could be restricted to those subjects."
"I rise today to recognize the contributions of Richard Stein, a leading advocate and partner for the arts and arts education across Orange County, California. Richard, who recently stepped down as the President and CEO of Arts Orange County, led the organization for more than 14 years. Under his leadership, Arts Orange County addressed the needs of the arts and culture community in Orange County as a trailblazer among nonprofit arts councils worldwide--augmenting traditional arts agency programs and services with its unique role as the community's go-to arts consultant to government, education, and nonprofit organizations. This has helped enable Arts Orange County, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary, to become a leading advocate for the arts and arts education on the local, state, and national level. Richard's stewardship also led Arts Orange County to become a strong supporter of the Congressional Arts Competition, providing funds for winning artists to travel to Washington, D.C. to see their artwork displayed in the U.S. Capitol. Prior to his appointment at Arts Orange County in August 2008, Rick transformed the Laguna Playhouse in Laguna Beach into a major resident professional theatre over the course of more than 17 years as its Executive Director, growing its annual budget of $700,000 to $7 million and producing more than 100 plays, including two national touring productions. He also directed many notable productions at this venue, including several premieres. Rick first came to Orange County in 1987, to serve as Managing Director of the Grove Shakespeare Festival in Garden Grove following a five-year stint as Director of Lincoln Theater at Connecticut's University of Hartford. Before that, he held management positions with two major symphony orchestras. Rick holds degrees in English from Columbia and Syracuse Universities and returned to Columbia for postgraduate study in drama on a National Endowment for the Humanities summer fellowship. He was sent to Korea on a cultural exchange by the International Theatre Institute-US, served on the executive committee of the League of Resident Theatres, and was a contributing writer to AMERICAN THEATRE magazine. Rick is a former Chair of the John Wayne Airport Arts Commission, past President of the Association of Fund Raising Professionals-Orange County Chapter, and twice former Co-Chair of National Philanthropy Day- Orange County. From 2009 to 2022, he served on the board of Californians for the Arts/California Arts Advocates, a statewide organization promoting the interests of the arts community, including three years as its President. Demonstrating his commitment to fostering an appreciation of the arts in the next generation, Richard has been a guest lecturer at University of California, Irvine and California State University, Fullerton, and was a commencement keynote speaker for the Laguna College of Art and Design. He has served as a panelist or site visitor for the National Endowment for the Arts, California Arts Council, Western States Arts Federation, Los Angeles County Arts Commission, City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs, City of San Diego Commission for Arts and Culture, Riverside Arts Council, New England Foundation for the Arts, Louisville Fund for the Arts, City of Pasadena, and the Connecticut Commission on the Arts, for which he also produced its State Arts Awards. Although his career has largely been in the theatre, Rick's first post after finishing graduate school was as Executive Director of a local arts agency, Oswego County Council on the Arts, located in Fulton, New York. In fact, the theatre company Richard co-founded in 1977, Contemporary Theatre of Syracuse, continues operation today as The Red House, a highly successful producer of multi-disciplinary arts. He is a 33-year resident of San Juan Capistrano with his wife, Alison, an artist. I call on my colleagues to join me in celebrating Richard Stein's leadership and stewardship of the arts in Orange County and thank him for helping bring arts and culture to our community and country."
"I ask unanimous consent the Senate stand in recess until 3:30 p.m. today. Without objection, the Senate, at 2:42 p.m., recessed until 3:30 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. Banks)."
"Let me first recognise that the BBC has been criticised by all sides in the conflict for bias, which shows the difficult editorial line that it has to walk, but let me also be clear that, in relation to what happened at the weekend, as the BBC itself has rightly acknowledged, the coverage, the standards and the enforcement of those standards fell well short of what was expected. I acknowledge that it is not the first time in recent months that that has happened. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government take this incredibly seriously. We are having discussions with the BBC at the most senior levels to ensure that this is gripped. As I said previously to other colleagues, I have levers at my disposal and will not hesitate to use them, should I need to."
"the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, some say it is the bee's knees. What is the buzz? Basically, it brings better jobs, bigger paychecks, and booming communities. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is about boosting wages, backing small businesses, bolstering border security, and it brings tax relief. Mr. Speaker, I recently sat down with manufacturers from my district in northeast Florida who reviewed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and they said bravo. The Trump tax cuts have bolstered growth, boosted job creation, and benefited American production. However, barring action, burdensome tax hikes will be bothersome. In northeast Florida alone, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act protects 15,000 jobs and over $2.6 billion in base economic output. The House has done its part, but I am banking on the Senate to bring it on and show the American people they are serious about ensuring manufacturing remains the bedrock of our blossoming economy. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is not just about good policy. It is the reason there is a buzz from break rooms to backyards. It brings bold benefits to builders, businessowners, and breadwinners. It is the best for workers, families, and our big, beautiful future. Let's get it done, and let's boogie."
"Mr. Speaker, this is about affordability for energy. Canadians need energy, and they need affordable energy. That is the essence of our standard of living in Canada. If we do not have access to affordable energy, we cannot live at the proper level of life as a nation. The government is coming between Canadians and actually saying, “Here, we are going to pick this kind of car for people to drive.” By the way, what people have relied on, what they grew up with, they cannot even hand down. They cannot hand down the car they used for the last 20 years to their kids, which is what they can afford. These are the kind of things the Liberals are talking about cutting off from families."
That's not true.
"My hon. Friend is right. Decisions to increase defence expenditure are not just about direct spending on the armed forces, but about the supply chain, industrial capability, defence suppliers and, critically, the skills to meet our defence needs. That is why the Prime Minister has referred to a defence dividend. This is not just security policy; it is industrial and skills policy, too."
"Mr. Speaker, the deal that was referred to involved quotas; it involved restrictions on Canadian softwood lumber. That is not the deal we want to get signed. We want to make sure we get the best deal possible for Canadian lumber."
"Mr. Chair, again, I would refer the member to the minister responsible for that file."
"I hope that my hon. Friend heard the earlier answer on the unduly lenient sentence scheme and the review by the Law Commission, but if he writes to me with the specifics of that case, I will make sure that we look into it."
moved that the bill be concurred in.
"As I outlined in my opening comments, the planning system does not work. It is broken, just as we have a broken housing market and a housing crisis. I mentioned the 74 children who died in the past five years; 58 were under the age of one. As Members of Parliament representing different parts of the country, we might disagree with aspects of developments in our constituencies, and we must not let developers off the hook when they often fail to deliver quality in new housing."
"Mr. Speaker, I share those same concerns. Last week in committee of the whole, the Minister of Energy said he has over 180 consultations with first nations over the next two weeks. How could he actually think that 180 over 14 days is meaningful consultation? The government is not a government that takes things seriously. There are proven ways of getting things done with first nations. In my own private sector experience working with first nations in Treaty 6, 68 nations out of 72 signed up to buy a pipeline. That was driven by the first nations in the sector themselves, not with government interference from incompetence and with rhetorical talking points. There is a way, but I am not sure this is the way for Bill C-5 ."
"Mr. Speaker, the member across the way is continuing the proud Liberal tradition of spreading misinformation. I have never denied anything about the horrors that occurred in residential schools. The Liberals are just trying to distract from their horrible record on the economy, of doubling the national debt and of increasing violent crime by more than 50% over the past 10 years, leaving this country weaker and more vulnerable to intimidation and tariffs from the United States."
I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).

"I rise today to commend and honor Mr. Michael Price of Essex, Connecticut, for his outstanding achievements in the realm of American theatre and the arts. On June 8, Michael will receive special honors for his lifetime achievements at the prestigious 2025 Tony Awards ceremony. Michael holds the record as the longest serving Executive Director of an American theatre, leading the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut for 47 years from 1968 to 2014. The impact of his tenure on the Goodspeed Opera House has reverberated all across the world, and thus this honor is well deserved. Michael was born on August 5, 1938, to William and Sylvia Price in Chicago, Illinois. From a young age, he was introduced to the theatre through family members who worked in the industry. Michael got a bachelor's degree from Michigan State University, followed by a master's degree from the University of Minnesota and a master's in fine arts from the Yale University School of Drama. Michael's career included many different jobs at theatres throughout the country. Early in his career, he worked as a stagehand and electrician at the Shubert Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut. Other jobs took him around the country, serving in different roles at theatres and performances before he settled at the Goodspeed Opera House. In 1968, Michael started as the Executive Director of Goodspeed Musicals in East Haddam, Connecticut. After years of disrepair, Michael helped rebuild the reputation of the Goodspeed Opera House as one of the best venues to develop musicals in the country. Goodspeed became internationally recognized for their distinguished performances. During Michael's time as Executive Director, he produced over 250 classic and forgotten musicals, 100 new musicals, and transferred 19 shows to Broadway, which earned 13 Tony Awards. The Goodspeed Opera House was honored with two special Tony Awards during his reign. Michael's valuable contributions to the theatre industry have been recognized before. He was inducted into the Theatre Hall of Fame, which honors lifetime achievement in the American theater. Michael's involvement in theatre is not limited to his time at the Goodspeed Opera House. He is also the founder of the League of Historic American Theatres and a founding member of the National Alliance for Musical Theatre. Michael currently serves on the Executive Committee of the American Theatre Wing and as a member of the Tony Administration Committee. Michael is also a board member for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, the Johnny Mercer Foundation, the ASCAP Foundation, and numerous charitable and non-profit organizations. Now, Michael will receive one of the Tony Honors for Excellence in the Theatre, a well deserved honor that he will share with his wife Jo- Ann, children Daniel and Rebecca, and grandchildren Ezra and Ari who have beenwith him every step of the way to this special honor. The Tony Awards are presented annually to Broadway productions for exceptional performances and include special honors beyond the boundaries of Broadway. Mr. Speaker, Michael has been an asset for the theatre community locally in Connecticut, nationally, and internationally. He spent his entire life dedicating himself to the preservation of the arts, and this award is a representation of that devotion. As a friend of Michael's for over twenty years, I can attest to his endless passion for advancing the benefits of live theatre, and for his wonderful, down to earth sense of humor. He is a caring person, always ready to help his community and people in need. He is an inspiration to all who have the opportunity to know him. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in this chamber join me in adding a layer to his already permanent case, by recognizing the astonishing career of Michael Price."
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague for the fact that she will now be my critic. It is good news. I am looking forward to working with her. Indeed, the comments coming out of the White House are preoccupying. That being said, no executive order has been signed yet, so we take these comments very seriously, but we are working on all scenarios. That is why the Prime Minister is in Saskatoon meeting with the premiers of the provinces and territories, and it is also why we will make sure we execute our plan to fight, protect and build."
"I absolutely join my hon. Friend in congratulating Danielle and David on the upcoming birth of their child. It is so important, as a parent, to be able to drive around, so I am sorry to hear about the delays they are experiencing. This matter gets raised with me lots at business questions. The Government have recently taken steps to deal with the abuse of and the huge backlog in the driving test system. We are delivering around 10,000 additional driving tests, but I will ensure that the House is updated on the matter."
"Yes, there was. There is real concern about the intolerable position in Gaza and what we can do to alleviate it. We have repeatedly said that it is intolerable, and that the current arrangements for aid are never going to work and cannot be maintained. Urgent diplomacy is under way to alleviate that situation, and we will continue with those efforts."
"Mr. Speaker, the fentanyl crisis has impacted communities across Canada and across North America. We are accelerating the work to crack down on and dismantle the fentanyl trade and the organized crime groups that profit from it. That is why we listed seven cartels as terrorist entities under the Criminal Code. I am working closely with Kevin Brosseau, Canada's fentanyl czar, at home and abroad, to put a laser-sharp focus on dismantling fentanyl. We will put those who are profiting from this drug behind bars. We expect support for the border bill from my friend opposite and the members across the aisle. This is a very important—"
"Far too many women, like Samantha, are forced to leave work because they do not get the support that they need. That is why we are meeting the needs of women with endometriosis in the workplace through a number of measures in the Employment Rights Bill. Strengthening statutory sick pay arrangements, making flexible working available to more people, and opening up conversations about women's health through employer action plans will benefit all employees managing the condition. We are turning the commitments in the women's health strategy into tangible actions."
I call the shadow Minister.
"It seems quite radical to suggest, as the report does, devolving responsibility for post-16 technical education and training to local leaders and transferring responsibility for skills to the Department for Business and Trade. Will the right hon. Gentleman briefly expand on that, and explain how it relates to apprenticeships on the one hand and university education on the other?"
"Mr. Speaker, we are not asking for a seven-year ban, but a lifetime ban. There are always scandals with this Liberal government. The Liberals ignore the rules; they allow their buddies to get rich. The taxpayers of Beauce and the rest of Canada are paying for it. The Prime Minister had the opportunity to change the situation by replacing the cabinet ministers responsible, but no, he gave them a cushy promotion instead. Why, under the Liberals, are politicians rewarded while Canadians foot the bill?"
"I rise today with a heavy heart and growing concern for the safety of our democracy. On June 14, in Minnesota, Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were gunned down in their home. That same night, State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot and wounded in a separate attack. These were not random acts of violence. The shooter left notes with the names of other public officials, including my own name.  The Minnesota murders were a warning. If we are to respond meaningfully, we must confront three hard truths. First, political violence is no longer an abstract threat. It is real. It is here. It is escalating. Public servants across this country face rising threats simply for doing their jobs. Second, these attacks are about more than individuals. They are destabilizing our institutions. The only offense that these Minnesota public officials and Leader Scalise were committing was serving their communities. When acts of violence are aimed at silencing civic participation, our entire democracy is at risk. Third, we must meet this moment with unity and resolve. We must reject the violent rhetoric and conspiracies that fuel this hatred. We must defend civil dialogue. We must stand together as Republicans and Democrats to condemn political violence and, for that matter, violence of all kinds. Just as an aside, I hope that the American people have a chance to watch this particular debate because I think that it really illustrates the unity and resolve that I think all of us must exhibit at all times. Representative Hortman and Senator Hoffman deserve more than our thoughts. They deserve our commitment to ensuring that this never happens again."
"Madam Chair, my colleague will be pleased to learn that the tax cut we have offered is going to help 22 million Canadians, and obviously a number of Ontarians. I am happy he voted in favour of that particular—"
"Mr. Speaker, the people in Columbia—Kootenay—Southern Rockies are expecting that this money will be recovered. Obviously, everybody in this House will be voting for this motion. Would you not agree? What do you propose would happen if some people, perhaps on the other side, do not vote in favour of this motion and do not want to recover the money that has been taken?"
I am sorry to have to interrupt the hon. member. The hon. member for Niagara South.
"I pay tribute to my hon. Friend's work in Derby on this--those photos are heartbreaking, particularly the one she mentions that so many in this House will have seen. We are trying to support Indian investigations in two areas: in relation to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch and through our disaster victim identification service, which is also on the ground. This is a truly horrific tragedy, and we are doing all we can to try to understand how it happened, and to support those affected as quickly as possible."
"I begin by thanking my hon. Friend the Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater) who has exemplified the integrity and transparency that we need in public service. I will speak about amendments 82 to 86, which were introduced by the right hon. Member for Salisbury (John Glen) earlier, because as a former lawyer, they concern me. In Committee, the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Sarah Sackman) was clear that the panel's decisions will be subject to public law principles. That will include procedural propriety and an absence of bias, including the appearance of bias. My concern is that the panel is deliberately designed to be inquisitorial. It is intended to collect information; it is not meant to be adversarial like a court."
"Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Liberals on their decision to adopt the Conservative policy of axing the consumer carbon tax. This was not easy for the Liberals, who opposed it for so many years. It was clear to us that it was a tax plan, not an environmental plan. It was a burden being imposed on people. Will the Liberals admit that the industrial carbon tax continues to be a burden, not only on industry, but also on Canadians?"
"this month, my fellow colleagues in the Senate--the Republican Senate Members--are working to pass a budget proposal that I feel can best be described as dangerous. Their plans are going to dramatically reduce--even gut--services like Medicaid and SNAP, which give food to hungry, low-income workers. It will strip healthcare away from, most likely, more than 16 million Americans and threaten millions of seniors living in nursing homes. All of this is focused, really, on just trying to give larger tax breaks to very wealthy people--who don't, really, in most cases, want them--or to the largest corporations. This lavish--and I think ``lavish'' is the only word that describes it fairly. This lavish tax bill gives more to the top earners while taking away from Americans with the least. But it really doesn't have to be that way. If Republicans could focus on extending tax cuts for working families rather than on the wealthiest--that one effort, in and of itself, that one initiative-- they could avoid ripping away healthcare from more than 15 or 16 million Americans; gutting our much needed investments in climate change--in fighting climate change--and making sure we have lower energy prices. Instead, they are going full steam ahead with really what is a god-awful bill. I want to focus today on another dangerous part of this plan: how it explodes our national debt and really risks our economic future. Many proponents of the bill love to hem and haw about being financially responsible. Like a few people in here,I have managed budgets before. It was back when I started Colorado's first brewpub and then as mayor of Denver and as Governor of Colorado. So I know something about fiscal responsibility, and it is not partisan. At its best, fiscal responsibility should be bipartisan. I can definitely say this bill that we are looking at is the opposite of fiscal responsibility. It is fiscal madness. This is a massive spending bill that is going to create the largest national debt in American history. You don't have to take my word for it. You can look at the numbers. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the House Republican plan--so this is the plan coming over from the House--would add $2.7 trillion--that is trillion with a ``t,'' $2.7 trillion--to the deficit over the next decade. The Penn Wharton model, which includes something like north of $500 billion in additional interest payments from that accumulated debt year after year after year, over 10 years, suggests it would add up to not just $2.7 trillion but more like $3.2 trillion or $3.3 trillion. The bill our Senate colleagues are putting together makes many of the same mistakes, and I think, by most measures that a small businessperson would look at, it is reckless. The bottom line is that more American tax dollars would go toward tax cuts for the ultrawealthy. Again, at least in Colorado, the very wealthy people I have talked to aren't asking for and aren't seeking these tax cuts. You know, under this tax plan that is coming over to us right now, those tax cuts for the very wealthy are coming instead of expanding access to healthcare or building roads or improving our schools, and more tax dollars would go to paying off the massive debt-- to paying the interest on the massive debt--than all of our defense spending combined. It will become more than 25 percent of our Federal budget just to pay the interest on the debt. Now, if that sounds like a bad idea to you, it is because it is, and the markets agree. Moody's, which is the last major credit rating agency to maintain the U.S. at its highest rating--at its highest, you know, designation as being a safe place to invest your money--just downgraded our credit rating. It is the first time that happened, and it shook investors that Moody's would downgrade our credit rating. Investors aren't confident that the United States will be able to pay its debts. At least in terms of Moody's, that has never happened before. It is really just going to lead to more trouble. Those investors who buy those tenured bonds and help pay for our national debt are demanding higher returns because they view it as a riskier investment; that they will need a higher return if they are going to hold U.S. debt. Since you have got to attract that investment, it means you have got to offer higher interest rates, which means you have got higher borrowing costs. That means that Coloradans and Americans are going to pay higher interest rates when they want to buy a house or expand their business or if they want to pay off their credit cards. They are going to have to pay more because the interest rates are going to be higher. Americans are already plenty concerned about rising prices and for good reason. This whole system could lead to the dreaded stagflation. This could all become a one-two punch to working families, all the while the wealthiest families will end up being better off. But we don't need to do this. We can certainly grow our economy. We can help working families, and we can cut the deficit. We were able to balance the budget all 8 years I was mayor of Denver and all 8 years I was Governor and still grow our investments in our roads, in our education system, and in our healthcare system. We also did this with the Inflation Reduction Act, which will reduce the deficit by over $175 billion over the next 10 years. It has already, dramatically, lowered a number of prescription drug costs, has expanded healthcare access, and in the process, has created hundreds of thousands of good jobs. The Republicans' budget, I think, does the opposite. We also can't forget that this budget comes in the midst of the Trump administration's efforts around tariffs and what our good friend, the Senator from Washington, was just talking about when she described the consequences of Smoot-Hawley and how those tariffs, just at 20 percent, led to a global slowdown in the overall economy. We all know that these tariff taxes are really not so hidden; they are taxes on the American people. They raise prices on everything from groceries to kitchen appliances. None of this is a growth strategy. It really is a recipe for a recession, at best, and stagflation, at worst. We can't borrow millions, we can't borrow billions, we can't borrow trillions just to hand out tax cuts to the top when working families are struggling to afford everyday goods. It doesn't add up. It never has. It never will.  There are many issues that may be partisan but being financially responsible doesn't need to be one of them, neither should good, strong economies, neither should economic fairness, neither should protecting working families. They don't have to do it this way. Now, I am always game to roll up my sleeves and dig into a balance sheet, but we haven't seen from the other side that they are willing to negotiate or really invest in long-term economic growth. I would suggest that we write a budget that reflects our values and puts tax cuts toward working families first, a budget that strengthens the middle class, one that keeps our economy strong and will keep it growing for generations to come. This bill is not any of that. I urge my Republican colleagues in the House and the Senate not to temporarily put a pass on their values and to support, again, what I think is a truly reckless fiscal bill. I hope that we can come together and negotiate a better bill that does more for economic growth and puts a far, far lesser penalty on the working people of America. I yield the floor."
"My hon. Friend is absolutely right that securing employment is known to reduce the risk of reoffending significantly. The Minister for prisons in the other place has led a business with a track record of getting offenders into employment, and I understand that National Highways is starting to build strong partnerships as chair of the employment councils in Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire."
"Mr. Speaker, again, what I support and what our government supports is making sure that we have a competitive economy that meets the global moment we are in."
"Mr. Chair, I appreciate the response and the comment on how difficult it was for the minister when he was a mayor to work with the federal government at the time. Maybe the minister can talk about the importance of having one Canadian economy and how important it will be in his file to create jobs and make sure that housing is built in a faster way, plus anything else he wants to add."
"Mr. Speaker, this is the first time I have delivered a speech entirely in French in the House. It is a very proud moment for me. The Minister of Finance was very clear in the House of Commons. The federal budget will be presented in the fall. I think it is better to do so in the fall because we currently have many challenges ahead of us, including the relationship between Canada and the United States, the defence partnership with Europe, and the bill to build a single economy in Canada. We have a lot of important issues to address."
"The town of Barrhead in my constituency is full of extraordinary young people, which is why my Scottish Parliament colleague Paul O'Kane and I have reinstated the Barrhead Young Citizen of the Year award. However, after years of Tory and SNP neglect, Barrhead is also blighted by youth-led antisocial behaviour. Will the Leader of the House make time to debate that issue, so that we can put pressure on the SNP Government in Edinburgh to give the hard-pressed police in Barrhead the resources they need to tackle this problem, and so that those young people are not left behind and Barrhead is not left paying the price?"
"My hon. Friend is a real advocate and champion for ceramics in his constituency and beyond. I am delighted to hear that, after this issue has been raised with me a number of times, Moorcroft Pottery has been saved by Will Moorcroft. I thank him for doing that. My hon. Friend will not have to wait very long at all for the industrial strategy."
"Mr. Chair, in these instances, we know that even a pandemic could not revoke an offender's rights or alter the date book in any way. Why were victims not afforded that same right?"
"Mr. Speaker, the hon. parliamentary secretary is a member from my home province of Nova Scotia. He has been an absolute delight to work with since I was elected federally, but even prior to that when I was a member of the Nova Scotia Legislature. He reminds me often of how young he is, but there is no age in this place. We all come from such different backgrounds. The member is quite right that I am of Lebanese origin, and I really do take pride in that. I feel the responsibility on my shoulders of being the new Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship in this beautiful country of Canada, which so many over generations now call home. This country is home, and many people have built their lives here, including my family. My father came here when he was in his twenties, a long time ago. I was elected for the first time in 2021, and before becoming a minister, I had the privilege of putting forward a private member's bill to enact Lebanese Heritage Month in the month of November. I encourage all members to go back to their communities in November and celebrate the rich history of Lebanese people and of all people who come here from everywhere around the globe to call Canada home."
"As we consider whether to put the Bill into law, we must reflect on our solemn duties, as legislators, to protect the wellbeing of our communities and safeguard them from harm. There has been much debate about giving people choice, about what happens in other jurisdictions, and about matters of faith and principle. I have heard from nearly 1,000 constituents, the vast majority of whom oppose the Bill for a range of reasons. I, too, opposed the Bill on Second Reading, and I set out my concerns, including those of principle, as well as major concerns about safeguarding. As a former children's services manager with more than 18 years of frontline experience, I believe that, far from issues of safeguarding being improved in Committee, many of the provisions have actually been weakened. My concerns are similar to those of the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith): the High Court-stage safeguard was removed from the Bill--fundamentally altering the basis on which Members voted on Second Reading--and the panels that replace the Court's approval and the voluntary assisted dying commissioner who would oversee them are new and untested concepts. They would not have the powers or functions of a court or tribunal, they would not be required to question witnesses and they could not compel them to attend. The doctors who would assess people's capacity and freedom to choose an assisted death would not give evidence under oath, and nobody would cross-examine them. The new assisted dying commissioner would run the assisted dying system and, at the time, be responsible for monitoring, investigating and reporting on its work, replacing the role previously given to the independent chief medical officers. The very definition of ""terminal illness"" has proved to be seriously flawed, because it would allow people with anorexia to qualify once their physical condition deteriorates. Amendments were tabled in Committee to introduce an enhanced test of a person's mental capacity to make the choice to die. On Second Reading, hon. Members were assured that the existing law, in the Mental Capacity Act 2005, was tried and tested, yet in February the chief medical officer wrote to the Committee to clarify that there is no enhanced test for life and death decisions under this Act. The Committee also voted to allow a future Health Secretary to change at will the Act of Parliament that established the founding principles of our NHS--the language that first passed into law in 1946. The NHS was established ""to secure...the physical and mental health of the people of England...and the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness."" However, because that does not include assisting people to take their own lives, the Bill, as amended, now contains a power for those foundational words to be changed by secondary legislation. Following the Committee stage, I chaired a session titled ""Committee of the Unheard"" to hear from experts who had not been invited to give oral evidence in Committee. We discussed the impact of excluding family and loved ones, as is this Bill's position. Importantly, the committee allowed us to explore issues around people with disabilities, people from other jurisdictions--specifically Canada--and black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. Had the Committee received that oral evidence, it may well have come to different conclusions. Finally, the Bill has highlighted the promise of choice. For choice to be real, there must be genuine options to choose from, but what has been highlighted is that palliative care provision is woefully inadequate, and that the worst served are also the most disadvantaged,  from the most deprived communities. Worse, should the Bill come into force, the provision of palliative care is likely to be compromised if hospices have no legal right to opt out of assisted dying. No such opt-out is proposed in the Bill. That brings me back to our role as legislators. The question for us now is this: after all the consideration, can we be satisfied that our duties to protect people's wellbeing and safeguard them from harm will be fulfilled if we pass the Bill? From everything that I have seen, heard and read, the answer must be no."
"Mr. Chair, I would be happy to provide the member with the detailed data on that as soon as possible."
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to present a petition signed by Canadians who want to draw the House's attention to the following issue. The petition states: Whereas our economic and financial systems depend on a stable climate and the Bank of Canada recognizes that climate change poses significant risks to the financial system and the economy and whereas continued financial support for emissions-intensive activities increases future climate-related risks to the stability of financial systems and the long-term interests of Canadians, we, the undersigned, citizens and residents of Canada, call upon the Government of Canada to enact the principal concepts of the climate-aligned finance act, which would establish a duty for directors and officers of federal financial institutions to align with climate commitments; align purposes of Crown corporations and departments, including market oversight by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, with climate commitments; and require the development of action plans, targets and progress reports on meeting climate commitments through annual reporting requirements."

"The latest inspection of HMP Lewes found that levels of violence, self-harm and drug use remain notably worse than at other reception prisons, with just one third of prisoners engaged in education or employment and many spending as little as two hours a day out of their cells. While the new governor has been praised for making some real improvements, the prison  is still described as being ""trapped in a cycle"" of boredom, short-staffing and drug misuse. What specific steps are the Government taking to support the governor's efforts, to ensure that these early improvements can be turned into lasting change?"
"Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise in this House for the first time as the member for Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke. This government is doing important work to ensure that we are protecting vulnerable Canadians, including vulnerable seniors, and that is why we continue to stand up for seniors. We are restoring eligibility to age 65 with the old age security program, and this is an important step to defend vulnerable seniors from falling into poverty. This policy also helps to protect low-income seniors who depend heavily on OAS and GIS—"
"I come to the floor today having just listened to the minority leader in the Senate talk about his view of the world and the economy and what the American people are seeing. Well, it is a misguided view, misunderstood, because he is clearly not seeing what so many Americans are seeing today in their lives. So I rise to share some outstanding economic news with the Nation because people back home are seeing that America is getting back on track. Americans want, need, and voted for affordable prices. Today, inflation is at a 4-year low. Inflation has fallen every month since President Trump and Republicans took office. Americans want, need, and voted for higher wages. Income has risen nearly every month--actually, every month--since President Trump and Republicans took office. Americans want, need, and voted for affordable groceries. Egg prices have dropped 61 percent under Republican leadership. Today, Americans are feeling upbeat about the economy. Last month brought the largest boost in consumer confidence in 4 years. Americans are confident about their future. A majority of Americans now say the country is finally heading in the right direction. This is after 4 years of high prices. CNN's own poll this weekend--this is CNN--they found that Republicans have a better economic plan than the Democrats. Not by 1 point--no, no, CNN didn't say by 1 point or by 2 points, but by 12 points--double digits. In the CNN poll, Republicans have a better economic plan than the Democrats. When it comes to the economy, Americans trust Republicans over Democrats. CNN on-air reporters appeared shocked and stunned--the video is astonishing. Look, Americans trust us because they are seeing real results. They are seeing Senate Republicans here fighting for them. Republicans have used the Congressional Review Act to reverse 18 punishing regulations and rules out of the previous administration. The most recent was when we ended California's leftwing electric vehicle mandate. You remember that? That is the one that said you had to buy an electric car. They were going to ban gas-powered cars by the year 2035. We got rid of that, and the American people are grateful. Now we are working on a comprehensive economic plan to deliver safety and prosperity for all Americans. Here are the facts: Republicans are committed to stopping a $4 trillion Democrat tax increase. It would be the biggest tax increase in American history. We cannot let it happen, in spite of the fact that the Democrats want it to happen. We also cut taxes on tips and overtime. Hard-working Americans will keep more of the hard-earned money and put it in their pockets, not in the government till. Seniors will be able to keep more of their social security. They have earned it. Republicans will also strengthen Medicaid for Americans who need it. Medicaid is a vital service. But let's talk about those who need it, because it is a trillion-dollar program, and what we see is that billions of dollars are being lost year after year to not just waste, fraud, abuse, but also to corruption. And that is taking the resources away from the people who need it. Remember, it is the Democrats who put millions upon millions of healthy, working-age adults onto Medicaid. Many of them absolutely refuse to work. Democrats want them to stay on Medicaid forever; Republicans want them to find a job. So the American Enterprise Institute, an organization that everyone in the Senate is familiar with, they came out with a report last week and said how nondisabled Medicaid recipients without children spend their time. So let's take a look at how folks who are working-age individuals who choose not to work who are taking Medicaid benefits-- interfering with sometimes other people who need the Medicaid much more than they do. But how is it working? How do they spend their time? Well, for Medicaid recipients who are not working, they say that, after sleeping, watching television and playing video games is how they spend their time. How much time? An average of 4.2 hours per day watching television and playing video games, rather than looking for work or working or volunteering or in school or education or preparing themselves to work. Apparently, they spend about 22 minutes looking for work. It is quite a disproportionate effort that shows where their priorities are. They are not looking for jobs. They are not looking toget off Medicaid. They like the life--television and video games. The Democrats want them to stay on it forever, and they want the American taxpayers to pay for it.  The American people are fed up with that sort of abuse of our taxpayer dollars. It was Democrats who gave 1.4 million illegal immigrants Medicaid benefits. How many people in our home States want that to happen? Very few in my home State and, Mr. President, I am sure very few in yours. The California Governor--do you know what he wants? He wants to add even more illegal immigrants onto the Medicaid rolls. Republicans want Medicaid for Americans who need it, not for 1.4 million illegal immigrants. And it was the Democrats who spent over $1.8 billion from Medicaid for transgender surgeries for minors. How many people in our home States think that is a use of government money? Republicans will also unleash affordable, reliable American energy. These are the things that are making the economy strong, that lower prices at gas stations and on electric bills. Senate Republicans are building a stronger, more prosperous America. That is why we have such good economic news and why people are saying: Yes, we are getting on the right track. What are the Senate Democrats doing? They continue to be committed to obstructing the Republican agenda, and they say they are going to do it every step along the way. That is what we see coming from the minority leader. They want to stop President Trump from even getting his team in place. The Democrats are filibustering every one of the President's nominees. Actually, by the end of this week, the Senate Republicans will have confirmed 74 nominees from President Trump that he nominated since January--74 nominated. The Democrats have filibustered 73 of the 74. The only one they didn't was Senator Marco Rubio. In the Foreign Relations Committee, last week, they said, ``We are sorry we voted for you,'' because they don't like what he is doing. I reviewed nomination records stretching back to the 1980s. Thirteen of these positions that require confirmation in the Senate have never before had a rollcall vote in the U.S. Senate--done by voice vote or unanimous consent. The Democrats have filibustered all of them. That is how obstructive they are. They filibustered the Chief of Protocol for the State Department or the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security. These are not controversial individuals. These are people that the Democrats say we are just going to try to stop President Trump no matter what he tries to do. They even filibustered the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, all to tie up the Senate, to waste time, and to try to slow down an administration that is working so hard to get our country back from the last 4 years of open borders and high prices that cost them the House, the Senate, and the White House. These aren't based on objections of somebody's qualifications for those positions. This is all meant to obstruct President Trump and obstruct the will of the voters. Lest the minority leader forget, it is President Trump who won all seven of the battleground States in the Presidential election in November of 2024. Well, Republicans are working through it. We have confirmed every one of President Trump's Cabinet at a record pace, and we are going to continue to work on all of these qualified nominees and get them all confirmed. We are united on whether it is confirming nominations or passing our comprehensive economic plan. We are united on our mission. We will build an America that is safe and prosperous and strong, and not just for today but for generations to come. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
"I am sure my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Care (Ashley Dalton), who is the Minister responsible for cancer, would be delighted to meet campaigners, particularly as we put together the national cancer plan. We want to ensure that we capture every type of cancer, and genuinely improve cancer care for everyone in our  country."
"Oh, oh!"
Will the hon. Lady give way?
"I rise today to recognize and commemorate the 10th Anniversary of the Epsilon Sigma Boule of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, based in Prince William County, Virginia. Since its founding on June 13, 2015, Epsilon Sigma Boule has exemplified the highest standards of leadership, scholarship, and community service. Sigma Pi Phi, also known as the Boule, is the oldest Black Greek- letter fraternity, established in 1904 to provide a space for African American men of professional distinction at a time when few such outlets existed. Its legacy includes names etched into the very fabric of American history--W.E.B. Du Bois, Martin Luther King, Jr., Arthur Ashe, Whitney Young, and so many others whose contributions have shaped our Nation. Today, its ranks continue to include influential leaders such as Representatives James Clyburn, Bobby Scott, Emanuel Cleaver, and Senator Raphael Warnock. The Epsilon Sigma Boule of Sigma Pi Phi was established to advance this rich legacy in Northern Virginia. Its members are African American men of accomplishment and service, representing diverse professions and industries. Together, they have embodied the Fraternity's founding mission by working diligently to uplift and empower their communities through servant leadership and civic engagement.  Through the Epsilon Sigma Boule Foundation, the fraternity has invested substantially in initiatives that serve the greater good-- mentoring youth, increasing access to STEM education, supporting the performing arts in Title I schools, and providing college scholarships for deserving minority students. These actions reflect a commitment not only to excellence, but to ensuring equity and opportunity for all. As the Epsilon Sigma Boule celebrates a decade of excellence, we honor its enduring mission and the transformational impact it continues to have in Prince William County and beyond. They have exemplified principled leadership and civic responsibility, carrying forward the Fraternity's mission with purposeful action and a steadfast dedication to community advancement. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing the 10th Anniversary of the Epsilon Sigma Boule of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity and in celebrating the tremendous work this organization continues to do to strengthen our communities and shape the future of our country."
"Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Coast Guard does play an important role. If the Liberals were going to move it over to National Defence and start transitioning it to be a paramilitary organization to actually be able to do interdictions and border security, I would be very supportive of that. However, right now, I just want to know if this is anything that means anything in National Defence, or is this just more creative accounting by the Liberals, taking expenditures out of other departments, ramming them under National Defence like they have for the last seven years, and trying to say that is how we are going to reach 2%? This does not increase the capabilities and operational readiness of the Canadian Armed Forces in any way, shape or form. We actually need to see investment in the kinetic equipment that is so desperately needed, like new planes, tanks, LAVs and ships. The Liberals are dragging their feet every time they step up; they fail to make a difference."
"Back again, and it feels a bit like groundhog day. I must confess that I am a Bill Murray fan, and I think ""Groundhog Day"" is a great movie. However, I realise that some Members on both sides of the House may not have been born when it was released, which makes me feel a little old, so I will explain a little of the plot. A weatherman set in his ways is sent to a town in Pennsylvania to report on groundhog day, and finds himself in a time loop in which he lives the same day over and over again. In due course, that leads to despair, but eventually he learns that this gives him the opportunity to learn from his mistakes--the time loops can be seen as a blessing or an opportunity, not a curse--and through this he grows, develops and changes. He then breaks out of the time loop to live happily ever after. We will be stuck in groundhog day on this Bill until the Government realise that the Lords amendments are not a nuisance, but an opportunity, and that they need to listen to the concerns and change course. The noble Lords in the House in which this Bill started have made clear the risk to creatives from AI companies taking their data, and the importance of fairness and transparency. We on the Opposition Benches and Members on both sides of the House have raised similar concerns, but we do not have the numbers yet. In Parliament, it is not sufficient to win the vote; it is also necessary to win the argument, and the Government have lost this argument. Copyright law is a toothless instrument if the lack of transparency about the use of creative content in AI models continues. The lack of transparency renders the enforcement of rights elusive, and the Government are apparently happy for this to persist on an open-ended basis. While the Government's direction of travel remains uncertain, everyone loses out. Creatives continue to lose out when their work is exploited without payment. Firms in the AI industry, especially smaller ones, cannot get out of the starting blocks, let alone play their part in turbocharging our tech economy. The Government continue to risk the confidence of both these key industries, with the chilling effect on investment that this entails. Of course, we are sensitive to the constitutional principles, and noble Lords were very mindful of that topic in their speeches in the other place. The Minister is right that it is almost unprecedented for the other place to return to a Bill so many times. However, rather than use this as a reason to try to push through the Bill, the Government need to listen to that evidence of the strength of feeling. We all know that the Government will have to respond to these concerns, and their position will have to change. I would love to end this speech with a literary quote suited to the substance of the debate, and I envy the Minister's ability always to bring flair to our discussions across the Dispatch Box. Instead, I will fall back on a political one from the 38th American President, Gerald Ford: ""Compromise is the oil that makes governments go."" The Government should meet the Lords on the compromise they have offered, put oil in the engines of our creative and AI industries, and bring an end to this groundhog day."
"Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege of informing you that the NDP agrees to apply the vote and will be voting in favour of the motion."
I call the Chair of the Select Committee.
The hon. member.
"Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member on his election. What I found interesting about the proposed spending is that not even 24 hours from the time the Liberals said spending would be capped at 2%, it has already inflated to 8%. I just question the fact that the government argues it is going to be different, yet what we see is more of the same."
"I rise to speak to my amendments 145 to 147 and to highlight the importance of new clauses 39, 84 and--if I have time--83. My amendments seek to correct a clear oversight in the legislation by extending the energy bill discounts to those who live near energy generation sites, rather than simply to those who live near energy transmission sites. Why is it that those who have pylons built near their homes are compensated, while those who have solar farms--such as the proposed Green Hill development near Grendon, Easton Maudit and Bozeat in my constituency --are not? That arbitrary distinction exposes the Government's proposals as not only inconsistent, but fundamentally unfair. Such disparities understandably rile residents who must live cheek by jowl with solar farms. By simply extending the energy bills discount, the Government would at least put an arm around those who bear the burden, and would encourage communities to embrace renewables. I encourage the Minister to take that forward, but I will not hold my breath. New clauses 39 and 84 are essential. The number of proposed battery energy storage systems is--if Members will pardon the pun--exploding. They should not be built on higher-quality agricultural land. The Government say repeatedly that food security is national security, but any plans that take agricultural land out of producing food leads the Government and this country down a very dangerous path. We must encourage and incentivise farmers to do exactly that: farm. The Government are creating an either/or situation by allowing battery energy storage systems and solar on higher-quality agricultural land. I urge Members to support these new clauses. New clause 53 proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid Bedfordshire (Blake Stephenson) would prevent local planning authorities from allowing developments on functional floodplains. I visited far too many homes in my constituency last year that were devastated by flooding. By developing on these known sites we are sleepwalking into a crisis. Homes will be devastated, with homeowners finding their homes uninsurable, and there will be risks to life. The Government are exacerbating the problem of flooding under this Bill."
"Mr. Chair, Canada is grappling with significant housing challenges. Housing needs vary across the country, depending on province, territory or neighbourhoods, and they are very distinct to those local needs. A collaborative approach is needed to address the current housing crisis where all the levels of government are participating. Housing and infrastructure are intertwined. They go hand in hand. The infrastructure needs to be in place in order for people to be housed there and for people to live their lives. The infrastructure needs to be in a state of good repair. We cannot build new housing or densify neighbourhoods if we do not have that base of water, sewers, transportation infrastructure, roads and transit, as well as community buildings to support the residents in place when they move in. That is why the government is bringing very direct and concrete links between housing and infrastructure funding. Investments will be aimed at developing complete, livable and inclusive communities that support jobs, economic productivity, environmental sustainability and enhance the quality of life in a way that really reflects the strategic long-term objectives of building climate resilience; supporting communities transitioning towards net zero, being energy efficient and clean; and helps communities identify their public infrastructure needs."
"I rise today to recognize my alma mater, Hackleburg High School, on winning the 1A baseball State championship. In the fourth inning, the Panthers were tied with Leroy High School 4-4. Ross Hudson, who was named MVP, singled, driving in the go-ahead run that proved to be the difference. Pitchers Maddox Vickery and Blaise Vickery held Leroy scoreless for the remainder of the game, securing the 1A championship. This was Hackleburg's second State 1A championship in baseball. As a proud alumnus, I stand here excited to congratulate Coach Jon McKinney and the entire team on an incredible season and for winning the title of State champion for the first time since 2007.  Congratulating Second Lieutenant Caroline Robinson"
"I hear that it is your birthday, Mr Speaker. Congratulations! The UK Government have announced PS14 billion for new, extremely expensive nuclear energy projects, while crucial shovel-ready green developments in Scotland are receiving nothing at all. Both Cruachan 2 and the Acorn project are awaiting the Minister's approval to create new green jobs in Scotland. When will that money be made available?"
"We knew that Iran had the ballistic missiles to hit Europe, let alone Israel or other parts of the middle east. Last week, the IAEA reported that Iran was within a whisker of producing atomic weapons. In the absence of diplomatic efforts and the failure to introduce the snapback mechanism, Israel had a right to react to protect itself. Will the Foreign Secretary now look at the diplomatic efforts to introduce the snapback mechanism and to impose sanctions on Iran to ensure that it cannot ever obtain nuclear weapons?"
"Madam Speaker, time is running out to introduce a budget. The Liberals have pushed things far enough, and it is hard to backtrack. There were no pre-budget consultations. Now they find themselves having to draft a budget without having heard from anyone. They spent their campaign scaring people. The solution is a budget update. At the very least, we need to know where we are at with revenue and spending. How much revenue will tariffs generate? How is the government going to pay for tax cuts? We need a summary document that would enable Parliament to do its job properly. I think the government can provide a pared-down budget while we wait for the fall edition. As I said, I am pretty sure that the Minister of Finance had already worked on this. I am guessing it is in his top drawer, but at some point, the Prime Minister and advisers told him to hide it away until the fall. I am fairly confident that it could be done pretty quickly."
"Mr. Chair, I have already spoken to that issue at some length tonight. It is an important issue. It is worthy of being raised. It is something I am seized with. It is something we are working on."
"I was very pleased to see that that flight came into Birmingham. We will do all we can to work with the Israeli Government to open airspace and to continue flights. We have a ceasefire. I have seen, of course, that that ceasefire has been violated, and I urge all partners to keep to that ceasefire so that airspace can open up and commercial flights can resume."
Absolutely: the NHS always does better under a Labour Government.
"I condemn antisemitism unreservedly, in London or anywhere else. Let me be clear: Hamas--the whole organisation--is proscribed in the UK. When it  comes to Hamas, we do not make the careful differentiation that I have made this afternoon between Israeli Ministers. The whole organisation, lock, stock and barrel, is proscribed by the UK Home Office. That has force under law, and it does not matter whether they are here or not. We continue to call on Hamas to release hostages, to return to a ceasefire, and to have no future role in the governance of Gaza."
"Oh, is it?"
"Mr. Chair, again, I disagree with the premise. The Sustainable Jobs Act will create jobs, not kill them."
"Mr. Speaker, Canadians cannot even afford these things. I do not think the member gets how much damage the Liberals are doing to Canadians' pocketbooks. Everything is more expensive. We are in the middle of an affordability crisis. People cannot afford housing, for heaven's sakes. Now the government is going to incentivize people. It is going to give Canadian taxpayers more of their taxpayers' money and say, “Here, go buy something else.” It is absolutely ridiculous."
"Mr. Speaker, the government has been very clear about our plan for housing, the most ambitious plan for housing in Canadian history, and that is “build Canada homes”. It is moving forward on concrete actions that will save people money. We are going to take action for multi-unit residential buildings that we hope the members opposite will support in the fall to increase rental supply. We are going to take action across the board, particularly on affordable housing, and we expect support in this House."
"I welcome the investment in skills announced today. What seems to be missing, though, is a commitment to give wraparound support to the 3 million workers in the UK currently in high-carbon industries, who will need reskilling and retraining in order to make the most of the green jobs boom. Can the Secretary of State give us any information on what is planned for those workers specifically, and does he agree that the fossil fuel giants should be the ones shouldering the cost of that support?"
"Last month, I had the honour of visiting RBSL--Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land--in Telford. Along with many defence companies and organisations, it is so proud of its effort to help Britain to defend itself here and around the world. The SDR provides certainty to industry, but we need to go further to ensure that every Government agency, body and Department--from skills and infrastructure to planning and the availability of land--gets behind its ethos. Does the Secretary of State agree that creating growth cluster zones will provide certainty to local communities and assist in that mission?"
"The debate will be opened by a member of the Health and Social Care Committee, Paulette Hamilton."
"Again, I thank the hon. Member for his contribution. We all have our localised industries that we are proud of, but we need a Government who recognise that and enable local businesses to thrive and survive. This is about how we invest and encourage new businesses to invest in our local economies, which is an essential element of the industrial strategy."
"The House resumed consideration of Bill C-5, An Act to enact the Free Trade and Labour Mobility in Canada Act and the Building Canada Act , as reported (with amendments) from the committee, and of the motions in Group No. 1."
"I rise today in support of Judge Stephen Vaden's nomination to be the Deputy Secretary of Agriculture. Judge Vaden is no stranger to public service. He served as USDA generalcounsel during President Trump's administration and now sits on the U.S. Court of International Trade, both roles confirmed by this body. He brings a deep understanding of rural America because he has lived it. His family has farmed in Tennessee and Kentucky for generations. That firsthand knowledge, combined with his experience in ag policy, makes him uniquely qualified to serve. USDA needs proven leaders to support Secretary Rollins to carry out the administration's mission in rural communities. Judge Vaden is ready to serve again, and I urge my colleagues to confirm him. I yield the floor.  Vote on Fotouhi Nomination"
"I welcome the Minister for Defence Procurement's announcement. This is welcome news for our country. Given that in-service dates for key pieces of military equipment are often later than predicted, has she given any thought to training our pilots in advance of delivery, either on a simulator or by embedding them into a unit that operates these planes around the world, so that we are ready to hit the ground running as soon as they are delivered?"
I ask for the yeas and nays.
"A woman came to my surgery in Ealing Southall last Friday and showed me photos of the one bedroom she shares with her four children. The five of them share beds and they live with black mould on the walls. All the kids have been hospitalised, no doubt because of related bronchial infections. It is temporary accommodation, but she has been there 10 years. That is not unusual. Does the Chancellor agree that today's record PS39 billion investment in social and affordable homes marks an end to Conservative  austerity and an end their failure to build, and that it will finally give hope to families stuck in damp, overcrowded flats in London and across the country?"
"My hon. Friend the Minister for Asia and the Indo-Pacific tells me that that particular report is coming forward in due course. Again, on the planning application, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific national security issues but, as I have said, material planning considerations, including those relating to safety and national security, will be taken into account."
"We have said from the very beginning that transparency is absolutely key to our ability to deliver the package that we would like to put together, and I do not resile from that, but it is only one part of the jigsaw that we need to join up. I point out to the hon. Member for Gosport (Dame Caroline Dinenage) that some of the items on the amendment paper are things that the two Select Committees asked us to do. She is normally more generous to me, and to others, than she has been today. She has clearly forgotten that the last Government introduced plans that would have produced a text and data mining exemption for commercial exploitation of copyrighted materials without any additional protections for the creative industries. That seems to have slipped her mind. We have moved a great deal since the introduction of the Bill. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology--who is sitting beside me--and I have moved. We have listened to their lordships, and, more importantly, we have listened to what the creative industries have had to say. The hon. Member for Perth and Kinross-shire (Pete Wishart) asked me whether I had ever known anything like this situation. Other bills have gone to five rounds of ping-pong, but in the past the row has always been about what is in the Bill, not what is not in the Bill. This is not an AI Bill, and it will not change the copyright regime in this country. I want that regime to be as robust as it ever has been, so that those in the creative industries can be remunerated and earn a living, as they deserve to. That is precisely what we intend to achieve, but we want to get the Bill on the statute book as soon as possible. That is why I need the House to vote with us this afternoon, and I hope that their lordships will agree with us tomorrow. Question put."
"I know that the hon. Member is frustrated and has worked really hard on this. I express my deepest sympathies to the families of DS Hunt and PC Taylor. I am sure she will agree that it is good that their families were awarded the Elizabeth Emblem by His Majesty in December, in recognition of the sacrifice they made. Honours policy is not in the gift of Ministers; as I mentioned, it is set out by the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals. I recognise that she has written to the chair of the committee on this issue, and I am sure he will reply."
The hon. secretary of state will have three and a half minutes left after question period.
"Mr. Chair, I have only been here for three and a half weeks, and I want to continue working with all the provinces, including Quebec, but also with my officials. We are going to come back to this. There have been many changes to many programs."
We will move on. The hon. member for Terra Nova—The Peninsulas.
"Mr. Chair, I have outlined the scale of investment that is happening through this department. We are talking about $16 billion of hard-working Canadians' money that is being invested in affordable housing and infrastructure. We hope to have the member's support for that."
"I thank my hon. Friend for raising that with me. He will know that GCSE subject decisions are taken by the independent exam boards, but he may be interested to know that the Education Secretary has recently written to the exam boards asking them to consider introducing a GCSE in Ukrainian. I hope my hon. Friend will continue that campaign, and I am sure that it will get wide support from across the House."
"Mr. Speaker, it is clear the fentanyl crisis is responsible for the taking of innocent lives in this country. It is incumbent upon all members of the House to approach this with empathy, but also with a level of seriousness to prevent fentanyl from sweeping through the nation and causing such damage. Going forward, we are going to be implementing a series of reforms that will target violent offenders, repeat offenders and organized crime, which is responsible for the preponderance of fentanyl in this country. I hope that we can work across the aisle on this important issue to help keep Canadians safe and protect our communities."
"Mr. Chair, what I have said is that the 2025 to 2027 targets have been set, have been labelled—"
Another delight.
"Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand."
"Nobody said it was a lie. That is not a term that is used in the House of Commons, and that is debate. I will let the hon. member for Winnipeg—"
"I could not agree more. This deal is supported by the United States, by our Five Eyes partners and by India. It secures our national security, the security of our allies and the base well into the next century. As I have said many times, if there was not a problem, why did the previous Government start negotiating?"
"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker; happy Pride Month to you, the whole House, my North Cornwall constituency and, indeed, the whole country. Pride Month is a celebration, but it is also a protest and a call to action--a reminder that the hard-fought rights we won must be defended and that the injustices still endured by many must be tackled, both here and abroad. We have already heard that around 64 countries still criminalise LGBTQ+ plus citizens. As a Liberal Democrat, I am extremely proud to belong to a party that has been at the forefront of the fight for LGBTQ+ equality for decades. My right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Ed Davey) moved the amendment that repealed the appalling section 28 in 2003, and the Liberal Democrats introduced same-sex marriage while in government, which enabled me and thousands of others to get married on the same basis as everyone else. But today we face a new wave of hostility, aimed particularly, it seems, at the trans community, which I will come back to. First, I want to focus on one group that is often overlooked: LGBTQ+ veterans. I have been supporting campaigners fighting for recognition, justice and dignity for those who were dismissed from our armed forces simply for being who they are. One of them, Adrian Radford-Shute, lives in my North Cornwall constituency. He was forced out of the Intelligence Corps in 1996 because of his sexuality, and he suffered horrific physical and sexual abuse. The trauma of that experience still lives with him and thousands of others--severe post-traumatic stress disorder and a lifetime of silence, without the recognition of the huge sacrifices that they made for this country. Adrian and others campaigned relentlessly, and finally, in December, the Government launched the LGBT veterans financial recognition scheme, finally offering some redress to those who are dismissed under the ban. Some, if not most, of those veterans also faced the most horrific cases of rape, abuse and other forms of unforgivable violence and coercion. Few were believed, and many were told that it was their own fault. I fought hard alongside Adrian to ensure that no veteran was left behind, regardless of rank or the circumstances of their dismissal. After direct engagement with the Ministry of Defence, I was assured that officers forced to resign would be treated equally to those administratively discharged, but the progress in reviewing cases has been abysmally slow. Of around 1,300 applications to the scheme, just 24 have been paid out. At this snail's pace, it will take up to 17 years for all those brave veterans to finally receive their compensation and their closure. This is a national scandal. While other military compensation schemes quite rightly award up to PS650,000, the LGBTQ+ veterans  compensation scheme is capped at just 10% of that. As a country we are currently asking ourselves how we can attract more recruits to our armed forces, but we do not treat our veterans with the dignity and respect they deserve. In this Armed Forces Week, I urge the Government to take action immediately to speed up these payments. Today, two thirds of LGBTQ+ people in the UK still report experiencing abuse or violence because of their sexuality or identity. Trans people in particular face constant attacks. Just a few weeks ago, I witnessed a vile incident with abuse hurled at a trans person walking down a high street in my North Cornwall constituency. In 2023, a Home Office report found that comments by politicians and the media over the previous year could have led to a huge spike in such offences. That brings shame on this House and our entire country."
"I thank the hon. Gentleman for highlighting the report by StandWithUs UK. Antisemitism has no place in our lecture halls, campuses and universities, and no place in our society. Universities must be places where all students feel safe and respected, and are able to thrive. A week ago today, I brought together university vice-chancellors and community leaders to hear testimonials from Jewish students, and to discuss next steps to ensure safer and more inclusive campuses for all our students."
"Mr. Speaker, when it comes to transparency and finances, this is something that, again, I think our government is working quickly on. This is the second-fastest return to Parliament in the history of our country, which is a testament to the urgency of the Prime Minister and the government. We are here in the House. I have been in opposition before; now I am on the government side. I know that the job of opposition is to ask questions and hold government to account, and I appreciate that role. That is what we are here to do. There are plenty of details and things to discuss in the House, and that is what we are here to do."
"Yesterday, we welcomed an ambitious and much-needed industrial strategy, which will rely on bold trade deals with countries around the world. Britain has a strong tradition of promoting human rights in its work around the world. How is the FCDO ensuring that we uphold our commitment to rights for girls and women as we develop trade deals with other countries?"
"Mr. Speaker, the question people watching at home have on their mind is whether the member believes it is important for Canada to meet its NATO commitment of 2% of investment in defence. This is really the question people at home are asking themselves: Does the member believe it important to meet our NATO commitment of 2%?"
"Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for his speech. As a fellow Albertan, it is sometimes wonderful to hear some of those thoughts, processes and pieces. He highlighted the Fort McMurray fire, how he came into the office of the NDP premier of Alberta shortly thereafter and that many failings happened, in large part because there was not as much communication happening among the different levels of government. Coordination was missed. There were 80,000 people being evacuated. I think sometimes it is really easy to look at things in isolation and play on those pieces. Since that time, we have learned a lot of things. One thing that is really frustrating to me as someone who has experienced wildfires since she was a kid, as I have lived in Fort McMurray my entire life, is that these are not new, but we are not building resiliency. What is his government going to do to build resiliency into communities so they do not have to evacuate and have fire protections in place?"
"My short, sharp answer is that wages have grown in the first 10 months of this Government faster than in the first 10 years of the last Conservative Government. Interest rates have been cut four times. My hon. Friend is right to say that progress is being made, and that needs to continue. We need to ensure that more people feel the benefits of that growth in their pockets. The changes we are making to winter fuel payments today are one of those benefits. I can confirm that there will be a block grant adjustment exactly as she sets out."
"Mr. Speaker, after the last lost Liberal anti-development decade, Canadians pay the price. Today the G7 starts. Canada used to be powerful, but the Liberals are lucky we still have a seat at the table. Canada's economic growth is now last in the G7. Allies like Germany and Japan begged for Canadian energy, but the Liberals rejected them, and $670 billion in natural resource projects died by delay and Liberal attacks. This PM claims “elbows up”, but they have been “elbows down”. Canada has the world's highest per capita resource wealth, but the Liberals made Canada more reliant on the U.S. Canada's standard of living falls behind, with an income gap of over $30,000 per person versus the U.S. The U.S. will still take up to 90% of Canada's energy at big discounts if the Liberals keep their job-killing Canadian oil and gas cap; the anti-development bill, Bill C-69 ; the shipping ban bill, Bill C-48 ; and the federal industrial carbon tax on Canadian businesses. In Canada, anyone from anywhere should be able to work for a powerful paycheque. Conservatives will—"
"Mr. Speaker, for the last time, I believe if you seek it, you will find consent to apply the results from the previous vote to this vote, with Liberals voting yea."
That is what I am calling for tonight: for parish and town councils to be able to decide the speed limits on the roads within their boundaries. They represent the voice of the people in those areas. I will move on from the tour of my constituency--although you are all welcome to visit some of these lovely villages sometime.
"I rise today to recognize the hard work and dedication of one of the First District's most dedicated public servants, the city of Norfolk's finance officer, Randy Gates. I have known Randy almost my entire life. He has served Norfolk for over four decades, and his career has been defined by a deep commitment to growing and maintaining Norfolk's economic success while using sound accounting principles and conservative fiscal planning. Thanks to his steady leadership and smart fiscal policies through the years, Norfolk has become a shining example for communities across our State. Earlier this month, Randy was honored with the League of Nebraska Municipalities' prestigious LEAD Award, presented at the 2025 Municipal Accounting and Finance Conference. This award is just one more testament to Randy's success and the enduring impact his work will have. I congratulate Randy on this well-deserved recognition. I look forward to his continued success and leadership on behalf of Norfolk.  Honoring Andrew Ozaki"
"Mr. Chair, there is money allocated in the main estimates to support capacity building on the part of first nations. We do that directly with particular first nations where there are critical mineral opportunities. We also do it in supporting a group called the First Nations Major Projects Coalition. It represents over 180 first nations. There are many specific critical mineral opportunities where the First Nations Major Projects Coalition is providing the capacity to negotiate strong ownership opportunities for first nations and accelerate the development of these critical mineral opportunities."
"Madam Speaker, my colleague says that the Liberals ran on a plan but Canadians are still waiting to see it. The new Prime Minister came in with the weight of big promises, fiscal discipline, economic competence and leadership in uncertain times, but since then, spending has jumped 8%. There is still no budget. Canadians are facing real struggles and they deserve more than campaign slogans. Canadians deserve a government that takes its responsibility seriously, and that starts with a budget. Will the Liberals bow to the will of the House and produce a budget before this spring, as we all voted for?"
"Mr. Chair, the Sustainable Jobs Act will create good-paying Canadian jobs, not kill them."
The hon. member has the floor.
"ITP Aero supports over 700 jobs in Hucknall in my constituency. I recently went to visit the site with representatives from Unite to meet those highly skilled workers, who are essential not only in supporting our defence sector, but for protecting our national security. What are this Government doing to ensure that work done under future contracts is completed in the UK, by UK workers?"
"Mr. Speaker, as a new member, I am very happy to be able to work and learn from my colleague within our new government. Fortunately, my colleague won his seat and was able to keep his seat in Winnipeg North. What will be the benefits of our ambitious plan to unify the Canadian economy?"
"Mr. Speaker, it is with tremendous pride, and thanks to the initiative and vision of mayor Jean Lamarche, that Trois‑Rivières will be hosting the 59th Quebec Games this summer, from July 25 to August 2. This event will bring together more than 3,500 young athletes, aged 12 to 17, from 19 regions of Quebec. It will feature 18 sports and celebrate excellence, passion and commitment. The success of these games can be primarily attributed to the incredible dedication of the volunteers. I would like to mention the chair, Martin Leblanc, Bernard Milette, and David Labecque and his team, who are working tirelessly to provide the athletes with the best possible environment to achieve excellence and personal growth. I invite everyone to Trois‑Rivières this summer to cheer on these talented young athletes, share their energy and make these games something our community will never forget."
"It is a very clever question, but it is the Minister who is responding."
"Mr. Speaker, as I have said before, I wish you could take part in this debate. That is the last time I will say it. I listened carefully to my colleague's speech. I was obviously already somewhat familiar with his position on the matter, since I also worked on Bill S‑245 and Bill C‑71 . Right now, we are working on Bill C‑3 . We have been working on this issue for years, so I think we all know where everyone stands. Does my colleague agree with me that the bill should be sent to committee quickly? When the time comes to send it to committee, it will need to be considered quickly, as well as thoroughly, of course. We need to move on. Does the member believe, as I do, that the immigration system is completely dysfunctional right now? We need only think of the asylum system, work permits and temporary foreign workers. Should we not be dealing with other urgent issues involving the immigration system? We have known for 10 years how people will vote on this bill."
"I thank my hon. Friend. The statistics I quoted earlier are pretty clear on the point he makes. Let me make some progress. The work undertaken by the coroner is not a box-ticking exercise or a bureaucratic hurdle. In the context of assisted dying, it is an extremely powerful deterrent against abuse and malpractice. Again, to quote Judge Thomas Teague KC, in a letter to The Times on 7 May this year, he said that the removal of ""any realistic prospect of an effective inquest...would magnify, rather than diminish, the obvious risks of deception and undue influence""."
"To put it more simply, the sense of urban sprawl is about the green belt not just between specific villages but between communities. We see that between Streetly and Pheasey in my constituency on the edge of Birmingham. Does he agree that it would help to tackle the problem if the Government adopted a truly brownfield-first approach by developing the 1.2 million homes that it is estimated are available on brownfield sites?"
"As I was saying, we do need to make sure that low-income families right across the board are receiving the support they need. That is why we set out changes to free school meals last week and it is why we will be coming forward with a child poverty strategy in the weeks ahead. I have already explained why the original decision was taken and set out that we have listened. The important thing is that it is right to maintain the principle of means-testing winter fuel payments but to do so with a higher threshold. As I have set out, the changes we are bringing forward today will mean that the vast majority of pensioners--over three quarters--will receive it in future."
The hon. member.
"Mr. Speaker, today I recognize a significant milestone for North Atlantic, a proud Newfoundland and Labrador energy company, with its planned acquisition of established energy assets in France. North Atlantic has entered exclusive negotiations to acquire a controlling interest in Esso SAF and full ownership of ExxonMobil Chemical France, developing a green energy hub of low-carbon fuels and renewable power. This planned investment will strengthen our province's growing connections with Europe and enhance our energy security. North Atlantic's commitment to sustainable local growth is clear through its wind-to-hydrogen project, expansion of its transportation and retail operations, and plans for a green energy hub to export green energy to Europe. These initiatives will create opportunities for our people, our communities and our economy. Newfoundland and Labrador companies are not just participating—"
"Mr. Speaker, the World Trade Organization plays a very important role. Last week I had meetings in Paris through the WTO. There are important mechanisms in place, and we already have that in action."
"My constituent Danielle Wiseman is desperate to pass her theory test, but she was recently told that she cannot get a theory test in Gateshead until 2026. Will the Leader of the House make time for the urgent debate needed on access to theory tests and driving tests--an issue that bedevils people in Gateshead and  across the country? Also, if she will allow me, will she congratulate Danielle and her partner David on the upcoming birth of their child?"
"Madam Chair, the answer to that question is one million. Over a decade of your government, you being a minister, the number of people in Ontario who regularly use a food bank has tripled. It has gone up by almost 700,000. Will you apologize to those 700,000 Ontarians who now must go to a food bank to put food on their table as a result of your government?"
"Does the hon. Member share my concern that some equipment, such as drone engines, may be being exported to Israel without the need for export licences and are potentially getting into the hands of military organisations, perhaps not directly to drop bombs but to engage in other military activity, such as providing reconnaissance and decoys? Does he support requiring all exported items that can be used within a military conflict zone to have a full licence, so that the public know exactly where UK businesses are engaging?"
"Mr. Speaker, I have another quote: “We need to reduce our exposure to foreign energy”. Does the minister agree?"
I ask for the yeas and nays.
"Resuming debate, the hon. member for New Tecumseth—Gwillimbury."
"My hon. Friend's local businesses are in agreement with many others that welcomed the package with the EU. It cuts red tape and opens up access to the EU market. On Operation Brock, the deployment is a decision for the Kent and Medway resilience forum, but the Department for Transport and Kent partners are working to keep it and other traffic management measures under review to ensure that they are designed and implemented in the most effective way, through actions such as traffic forecasting, using better data and exploring the use of AI for that purpose."
"Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotia is ready to negotiate a pharmacare deal, but it is still waiting on an invitation from Health Canada. The Prime Minister has not committed to expanding pharmacare for all Canadians. Access to essential medications should not depend on where one lives or one's private coverage. With the job losses from Trump's trade war, the need for public medication coverage is clear. Will the Liberal government commit to delivering universal pharmacare for all Canadians?"
"Mr. Chair, this falls under the ESDC minister 's portfolio. I would advise my colleague to get in touch with the minister responsible for that."
"Mr. Chair, I will advise the minister that, actually, her plan has more than one year in it. It has three years. Does she not know the number for the end of this year?"
"If we are to deliver local bus services, we must deliver buses that are efficient and technologically modern to ensure we can meet those targets. With that in mind, will the Minister assure the House that any action taken by Government to provide buses and local bus services will support bus manufacturing across all parts of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and, in particular, Wrightbus in North Antrim?"
"Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 32(2) and consistent with the policy on the tabling of treaties in Parliament, I have the honour to table, in both official languages, the treaty entitled “Agreement between Canada and the European Union Amending Annex B of the Agreement on Civil Aviation Safety between Canada and the European Community”, done at Washington on June 12, 2024."
If she will make a statement on her departmental responsibilities.
This is a subject in which I might have more than a passing interest.
"Mr. Chair, I am certainly thankful to be elected by my constituents in Vancouver Fraserview—South Burnaby. I am here to represent my province as well. With my knowledge from serving at the city and provincial levels, I will do all I can to deliver positive change and a lot of affordable housing in our home province."
"in New Mexico, we practice querencia. Querencia is a deep, even spiritual, connection to the land--a love of place that demands that we care for what has been passed down to us and protect it so we can pass it along to future generations. Today, I stand on the Senate floor to pay tribute to a man who literally embodied this idea. His name was Ralph Vigil. And Ralph grew up along the Pecos River, at the foot of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, in Northern New Mexico. With family roots extending hundreds of years, Ralph often called himself ``a twelfth-generation Hispano in a state of Nuevomexicanos.'' He took pride in his Hispanic and indigenous heritage, and every aspect of Ralph's life was really a testament to his commitment and connection to our State and its people. A parciante of his local acequia, Ralph often brought people in to share acequia traditions, and this included Mark Allison, the executive director of the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance. One year, Ralph and his family invited Mark for an annual acequia spring cleaning. So all day, they shoveled and raked and cleared the way for the water to be able to nourish the fields. Once they were done, they went up and opened up the headgate. Ralph's dad moved a few rocks, and Mark and Ralph stood and watched the water come down to water the fields. As mayordomo of the Acequia del Molino, Ralph determined the allocation of water for each family like he did everything else, with the resounding belief that in the acequia, as in life, everyone is equal, bound together by water, by land, by tradition. So Ralph carried these principles of equality and justice and interconnectivity to literally everything he did. As chairman of the New Mexico Acequia Commission for 19 years, Ralph fought to protect the water and the needs of local communities. In the words of Juan Sanchez, who worked alongside Ralph at the commission, ``Ralph . . . helped communities who didn't really have a voice, keep a voice.'' And when extensive mining proposals threatened the traditional way of life along the Pecos River, Ralph stepped into action, helping to form the Stop Terrero Mine Coalition. This is where I really got to know Ralph, as we worked together to craft and introduce legislation, the Pecos Watershed Protection Act-- legislation to defend our watersheds and designate over 11,000 acres of national forestland as the Thompson Peak Wilderness Area. At the Federal and State level, Ralph was a community leader in every sense of the phrase, committed to protecting and nurturing the people and places of New Mexico. He was also a farmer, a father, a skateboarder, a mariachi, and a friend--one who let others know how much they meant to him. As described by one of his close friends and colleague he worked with, Garrett VeneKlasen, ``Ralph was an old soul and a sage'' who ``radiated goodness and grace.'' His friend Robert Apodaca put it similarly:  Ralph . . . loved with his whole heart and soul. . . . [And his] legacy lives on in every life he touched and every cause he stood for.  Julie and I extend our heartfelt condolences to Ralph's family, friends, colleagues, and community. And I know that we will all think of Ralph every time we see the Pecos River. May we all honor Ralph's memory by carrying on our own querencia for the places and waters that have sustained our way of life, traditions, and forged our communities."
"Most military operations require an element of surprise, and the Government certainly achieved that by delivering the news of the return of tactical nuclear weapons through the medium of The Sunday Times. That marmalade-dropping moment aside, what impact will the apparent purchase of F-35 Lightning fighters from America have on the global combat air programme that we are putting together with Italy and Japan--or should I wait for the ""You read it here last"" strategic defence review?"
"I rise today to honor the incredible life of Joe Moore. who passed away in late March at the age of 90. Moore lived a life dedicated to agriculture. I, along with many other current and former Tennessee FFA members, consider him to be a mentor, a role model, and indeed a hero. The Time Magazine cover was published after he was named the FFA Star Farmer of America in 1955. Appearing in the October 24, 1955, issue, it shows a 21-year-old Joe Moore, the only active FFA member to make TIME's cover. At the FFA convention that year, judges were impressed by his farming operation conducted in Jackson County, Tennessee, which I am honored to represent today. He had a net worth of $37,000 at the time--a great deal for someone his age in the mid-1950s. At that time, he was farming 505 arches, 85 of which he owned personally. I often say farmers are our Nation's original conservationists. Joe Moore is a shining example of why I believe that to be true. The TIME article noted how he incorporated modern farming techniques to combat erosion and improve soil health. He carefully monitored the diet of his livestock to keep them healthy. He showed great attention to detail and inspected his animals closely, which enabled him to detect any health issues early. Over the years, his family farm has taken a bit of a beating. Very little care was taken to where row crops went into the ground. No remedies for erosion had been taken. But Joe was determined to restore the land to richness. He tackled years of abuse and the less-than-ideal terrain, arguing that his rocky slopes could be as fertile as flat land with the right amount of care. The article even says Joe viewed misfortune as a test of faith. Mr. Moore found success off the farm as well. He was the owner and operator of the Upper Cumberland Oil Company in Cookeville,which sold and distributed Texaco petroleum products for almost 30 years. He also believed in giving back. He was one of the founders of the Granville Museum in his home community and served on its Board of Directors. He also served as an elder of the Liberty Church of Christ and was a longtime supporter of FFA in Tennessee. He is survived by his wife of more than 68 years, Ann, along with a son, a daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren. I want to end, Mr. Speaker, with a quote from Moore from 1955, ``farming is the closest thing to the Lord you can do.'' I could not agree with him more."
"Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Winnipeg North's intervention was nonsensical, as usual. The Auditor General looked at the contracting and did not find issues from the Harper era. The issues seemed to start in 2015, when the Liberal government took over. The Auditor General did two different reports on contracting around the issue, and not once was an issue brought up of poor procurement or fraudulent activity during the Harper era. It was all done during the Liberal era. I think the gentleman needs to reflect on himself and his comments, and look inward to see where the corruption is."
"Mr. Speaker, contrary to Conservative disinformation, housing starts are up across the country right now. We are seeing both a year-over-year increase in housing starts and certainly a large increase over when the leader of the Conservative Party was the housing minister. We are going to take this forward with the most ambitious housing plan that has ever been seen in Canada. We are going to build affordable housing across this country."
"Mr. Speaker, it was the Prime Minister who said that Canadians will hold them accountable based on their experience at the grocery store. The experience is a nightmare, and Canadians are getting fed up. Under the Liberal government, food prices have skyrocketed, but instead of offering a real budget plan, the Liberals are plowing ahead with a half trillion dollars in new spending. Hard-working Canadians are having to foot the bill for the government's runaway deficits every time they shop for groceries. How is this acceptable?"
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I will clarify some things. My colleague continues to talk about the tax bill, which is not actually in front of us right now. We are talking about different things. I do feelthe need to address that in that tax bill that he is talking about, in the reconciliation bill that he trashes and says that it is tax breaks for billionaires. I will just use my district as an example. In my district, in the Seventh District of Minnesota, the reconciliation bill that he opposes would prevent a 25 percent tax hike for most people in my district where the average income is $70,000, not billionaires, $70,000. It also increases the standard deduction. It increases the child tax credit. It helps small businesses through the 199A deduction. This is a solid tax bill. We looked at what we can do to help the average citizen in the country, and we made sure that it was a solid tax bill. I just wanted to make sure that we are correcting some of the talking points that the Democrats are using because this does provide tax breaks for the middle income. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let's talk about people in the gentlewoman's district in Minnesota. I point this out because I am learning that a lot of Republicans didn't read what was in the bill, so let me just provide some information for her. Under this bill, 5,800 people would lose coverage under the Affordable Care Act in her district alone; 15,367 in her district alone would lose Medicaid coverage; 21,167 people in her district alone would lose their health insurance outright. I mean, really? Is that what representation is all about? Please. That is what is in this bill that most of you never read. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Stansbury)."
"(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) Vote #19"
"Madam Speaker, yes, people in our part of the province are very glad to see the consumer carbon tax gone. That is really bringing expenses down. If the industrial carbon tax is not removed as well though, that cost will be passed on to consumers in the region and it is going to hurt. That is why all carbon taxes have to be removed."
"Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has ambition, and we have a strong mandate from Canadians to build Canada strong. Part of building Canada strong is these major projects to get our resources to market."
"That is not a point of order. Resuming debate, the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader."
"Mr. Chair, the minister did not listen to the question I asked. He repeated his non-answer from the previous question. I invite him to come up with a new non-answer to the new question. The new question was this: Does the minister think that companies that do work for hostile foreign regimes should be able to simultaneously do work for the Government of Canada?"
"I thank the Minister for that response. As an adoptive parent and a foster carer, I know the transformative effect that early permanence can have on the lives of children in care. It is not right for every child or for every parent, but adoption agencies could make much wider use of it. Would the Minister be willing to meet me and adoption charities to discuss how we can maximise the benefits of early permanence?"
"I pay tribute to Lord Etherton, who died recently; his review on the injustice to LGBTQ+ veterans was enormously important. I really welcome this review from the Secretary of State. I have been around long enough to have seen the words ""review"", ""defence"", ""strategic"" and ""modern"" used many times. As the Secretary of State highlighted, the nadir was reached when the right hon. Member for Stone, Great Wyrley and Penkridge (Sir Gavin Williamson) was Secretary of State, in a report that had more pictures than text. This report will live only if all Members of this House agree that it is long term, because as the Secretary of State knows, chopping and changing and stopping and starting programmes can cause real problems for our men and women on the ground. Does the Secretary of State agree, and what is he doing to make sure that we embed the review for the long term?"
"Mr. Chair, any sort of shift within the Constitution, which the bill does, requires consent. Moving on, does the minister agree that the government must uphold its constitutional obligations set out in treaties, yes or no?"
I thought I just spoke once at the end.
"Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate for the people who are sitting in the public gallery or who may be watching at home, because the opposition clearly has not delineated the facts on a few things, and one is that there is a process. The motion before us talks about 100 days. My question to the hon. member is this: Does he suggest that there should not be a court process, that if GC Strategies or its associates choose to defend the allegations in court that the government should just find a way to railroad that process? The government is actually under a process to recover the money. It is following the Auditor General's steps the entire way. The situation was rooted in the federal public service. It was a problematic procurement. The government is taking accountability, it is taking actions, and it is seeking to recover the taxpayers' dollars. However, when the Conservatives were in government, they awarded contracts to GC Strategies. I hope that the member will make the distinction that this was rooted at the federal core and that we are getting the money back for Canadian citizens, but maybe not in 100 days, because there is due process in this country."
"The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that the impact is not just within the county, but causes a huge knock-on effect on wider services. The decision is a damning indictment of how our health services have been treated, and how they have been run into the ground following the Conservatives' regular cuts. Residents in Glastonbury and Somerton are devastated, and are concerned that this six-month temporary closure could then become permanent. I have had many examples of residents contacting me, including Ben. He and his wife are from Martock, and are expecting their first child in September. They have planned a home birth with support from the Yeovil midwifery team. They can still access those services, but if complications arise, they will no longer be able to rely on Yeovil hospital services, which are only a 15-minute drive away. They will have to go a lot further, driving at least 45 minutes to access Taunton, Royal United hospital, Dorchester or Salisbury. There are so many unanswered questions, especially on how the closure will affect the capacity of Taunton's Musgrove Park hospital, or Dorchester or Bath's maternity units. We need clarity now. Our residents deserve that. Will the Minister give us and our constituents that clarity, so that those who are looking forward to starting a new family or who are growing their family can know that the journey through their pregnancy will be safe and that they will have a family beyond that?"
"As the MP for a rival city centre in Manchester, I am well aware of concerns of the type raised by the hon. Gentleman. We do support our hospitality sector, and we are taking a number of steps to support growth in our economy and to support employment. We had to take tough decisions in the Budget to ensure that our NHS and other public services have the resources they need to ensure that we have a healthy workforce to work in that sector, and that has meant a national insurance rise for businesses."
"I think I have answered that question, but I am happy to lay it out again, if that is helpful. There is a long-standing principle of individual taxation, which I think is supported by all parties in this House. Where a couple are not receiving a means-tested benefit, they will each receive half of their household's winter fuel payment. Whether they continue to keep that or it is recouped through the tax system will be based on their individual taxable income. For example, if one has an income above PS35,000, their payment will be recouped by HMRC automatically, but if the other has an income level below PS35,000, they will retain the winter fuel payment. I hope that clarifies things."
"Oh, oh!"
"Of course we have regard to and concerns for Palestinian people. The questions at issue in the assessment of risk are complicated legal ones. They are complicated because the corpus of international humanitarian law ends up relying a great deal on what is in the mind of a commander when they make a decision. International humanitarian law is tightly constrained, and it is difficult to make conclusions about what is in the mind of a commander who will not share their thoughts with us. That is why, when we make determinations, we consider other limbs of international humanitarian law. We are not saying that in all the cases, the action was proportional and necessary to meet the military objectives, but where we cannot determine that, we can look to other limbs. Those limbs include the obligations on an occupying power relating to the provision of aid and the treatment of detainees. Those are easier tests to meet, because they do not require knowing what is the mind of a commander."
"Mr. Speaker, if the member opposite has questions for the minister of labour or the minister of skills and employment, I am happy to direct those questions to them."
"I thank the Minister for his statement. I very much welcome the decision to give the winter fuel payment back to pensioners. Raising the threshold to PS35,000 means that many will now qualify, and I thank him for that. On behalf of all of those pensioners who have struggled for the last 10 months, will they receive back pay from the Government to pay off the credit cards or the loans they have had to take out in order to make it through the last winter, bearing in mind that the cold weather over the last few weeks has meant people are still having to turn their heating on and racking up even more costs?"
"Mr. Speaker, when the plan entitled “Canada Strong” was released, it immediately resonated with the people in my riding, so I congratulate all who developed this plan, which addresses our nation's fundamental need at this critical time: economic prosperity. I would now like to share some of the significant comments I received regarding economic prosperity from three sectors of my riding: mining, agriculture and defence. The first are comments received from the mining sector. As some may know, northern Ontario accounts for most of Ontario's mining activity, with approximately 200 companies, a third of which are in Nipissing—Timiskaming. Mining is the largest commercial contributor to the GDP of Nipissing—Timiskaming. The riding is a hub for the global mining supply and services sector. This past weekend, the mining institute of Canada celebrated 100 years of mining in North Bay. From North Bay, companies export and operate around the globe via the city's well-developed transportation network, including highway, rail and air connections. The local industry is known internationally for its innovation, and it collaborates with post-secondary institutions to develop new technologies. When I met with representatives of these companies, there were three issues that came forward. The first is access to labour. With mining expected to see strong growth in the next few years, what is problematic is that 21% of mining workers in North Bay are over the age of 55 and are nearing retirement. The shortage of housing remains a major barrier to attracting new residents to the region and is why housing projects tied to the North Bay area will continue to need support in this mandate of government. A second issue is tied to the fact that 65% of local companies will be introducing new products to the market, and they will continue to need strong support for innovation from organizations such as FedNor and the Business Development Bank. The third issue is that 60% of these companies export around the world, and they will continue to need support from Export Development Canada for managing their risks. Second, I would like to say a few words about agriculture. We sometimes do not think of the north in terms of agriculture, but there are significant opportunities for expansion in the agricultural sector in Nipissing—Timiskaming, in what is known as Little Claybelt: the area of Temiskaming Shores, Earlton and Belle Vallée. In Timiskaming, there are 456 dairy, cattle and crop farms, with an average size of over 500 acres. With the growing days, days that are getting longer, it is predicted that this is an area that will have much opportunity moving forward. When I met with influencers in that area, they spoke about three things. The first is protecting supply management. They were very thrilled with the words that were included in the Speech from the Throne, as well as with statements made by the new Minister of Agriculture . However, they pointed out the last trade negotiations with the United States, where supply management was supposedly off the table but concessions were nonetheless made at the last minute, so they intend to remain vigilant in the future. Their second concern is for financing. They need the support of Farm Credit Canada and FedNor. Third, they ask that Highway 11 north be included in the Canada strong plan, as it is an important highway that falls under the plan's provisions for building an east-west trading corridor and twinning the Trans-Canada Highway. As we know, Highway 11 is the main route used for truckers as they travel the country from east to west. Finally, I will say a few words about defence. People may not recognize that since 1951, the city of North Bay has been home to the Canadian Forces base known as 22 Wing North Bay. It has 500 military personnel who provide surveillance and warning for the aerospace defence industry and work closely with NORAD in Colorado. There are also U.S. military personnel stationed in North Bay. From a city perspective, there is a strong interest in our base. It has strong ties to our communities. We have an airport with a military-grade runway. Flight schools, a Canadore College aviation campus and Voyageur Aviation Corporation operate out of this facility. There is an increased interest in the impact of the “Canada Strong” plan, which focuses on rebuilding, rearming and reinvesting. The base's facilities need housing improvements. I will also say a quick word about an issue tied to the CFB but not its daily operations. It is related to a major water contamination problem. PFAS, known as a “forever chemical”, used in the foam for air defence firefighter training until the late 1990s, seeped into the airport grounds and surrounding groundwater. The city and the Department of National Defence have reached a $20-million agreement to clean up the airport. However, and I will conclude on this point, the contamination has also seeped into waterways connected to Trout Lake, which supplies North Bay with drinking water. In recent months, Health Canada has established that the maximum allowable concentration of PFAS in drinking water is 30 nanograms per litre, while Ontario's 2024 drinking water report indicates that the City of North Bay's drinking water system is the only known system in Ontario that consistently exceeds this limit due to historic PFAS contamination. As a result, additional funding is needed to upgrade North Bay's water treatment plan and to remove PFAS from the water supply. This is urgent. There are so many other things that I could say with regard to the comments that I heard from my community following the election and with regard to our “Canada Strong” plan. That being said, I am pleased to see that the plan and the Speech from the Throne identify those issues and that meaningful action will be taken to address each one of them. In closing, I want to reiterate my full support for the throne speech on behalf of the people of Nipissing—Timiskaming. I am happy to take any questions from my colleagues."
"Mr. Speaker, I agree that it is a great moment to reach, but according to Deloitte, the plastics ban the government is proposing would raise produce prices by 34% and increase food waste by 50%. Given the rising food bank use and the cost of groceries right now, is that a good idea?"
"Our recent trade deals with the United States, India and the EU will improve access to vital markets for businesses in both Scotland and Northern Ireland. These are deals with the most populous country in the world, the richest country in the world and our most important trading partner. I recognise the importance of economic co-operation between Northern Ireland and Scotland. Indeed, earlier this week I met the hon. Member for South Antrim (Robin Swann) and a local business to discuss exactly this issue."
"Absolutely; we intend to clear up the mess the previous Government made. The fine that my hon. Friend refers to--indeed, there have been others--is the result of the additional criminal investigations we have launched, which follow on from the additional resources we have given the regulator so that it can investigate what is going wrong and then take action. What a difference between this Labour Government, who are putting our water companies under special measures, and the previous Government, who let them get away with it and line their pockets."
"Mr. Chair, yes, of course I can. We have implemented an enhanced letter of acceptance verification system to protect these students from fraud."
"I rise today to honor the TCU Women's Beach Volleyball program on winning the NCAA National Championship Tournament. In a thrilling final, the second-seeded Horned Frogs triumphed over Loyola Marymount University with a 3-2 victory. This historic win not only marks TCU's inaugural national title in beach volleyball but also signifies a shift in the sport's landscape, as TCU becomes the first program outside of USC and UCLA to claim the championship since 2016. Under the leadership of Head Coach Hector Gutierrez, the Horned Frogs showcased resilience and determination throughout the tournament. Key contributions came from standout athletes Daniela Alvarez and Tania Moreno, whose exceptional performances were instrumental in securing the championship. Before the tournament, TCU won the Big 12 regular season and the conference tournament. This fantastic season is a testament to the dedication of the student-athletes, coaching staff, and the entire TCU community. It reflects the university's commitment to excellence in collegiate athletics and serves as an inspiration to aspiring athletes nationwide. On behalf of the 12th Congressional District of Texas, I am proud to recognize the TCU Women's Beach Volleyball team for this remarkable achievement. Their hard work and perseverance have earned them a well- deserved place in NCAA history. I am excited to see how this program will continue to grow and proudly represent the University."

"It is my duty to lay upon the table, pursuant to section 11 of the Lobbying Act, the report of the Commissioner of Lobbying for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025. Pursuant to Standing Order 108(3)(h), this report is deemed to have been permanently referred to the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics."
"It being 6:15 p.m., it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every question necessary to dispose of the amendment to the amendment and of the amendment, as amended, now before the House. The question is on the amendment to the amendment. If a member participating in person wishes that the amendment to the amendment be carried or carried on division, or if a member of a recognized party participating in person wishes to request a recorded division, I would invite them to rise and indicate it to the Chair."
"The right hon. Gentleman is wrong, I am afraid. It is in compliance with the non-proliferation treaty. The NATO nuclear mission would carry US nuclear weapons, which are already subject to the non-proliferation treaty. What we are announcing today is the buying of aircraft that are capable of assisting with that mission, not the purchasing of new nuclear weapons. I hope that is clear for the right hon. Gentleman."
"I am grateful to my hon. and gallant Friend for joining this merry band of evangelists for floating solar, and for seeking to get in on the ground floor with the inclusion of the reservoir in his constituency. Within minutes, he is immediately seeing the opportunity, and I congratulate him on that."
"let's talk about crime in D.C. Let's talk about crime in D.C., as the gentleman mentioned. Let's talk about that. Let's talk about January 6. We had 1,500 people ransack the Capitol. Let's talk about what happened to them in consequence. They were rewarded. They were pardoned. Yet, to this day, the Speaker of the House refuses to hang the plaque honoring the over 150 police officers who defended the people in this Chamber, who defended the Republicans. I know all the Republicans didn't feel safe that day because I saw them running from the crowd, running in fear, until the President told them, no, that was just a tour of the Capitol. They all made excuses for what happened that day. Not one of those people who ran out of the Capitol for safety that day came back to say that they should be held responsible. Now, all of those people have been pardoned. Mr. Speaker, when they talk about crime in D.C., holding people accountable, and feeling safe, do they think that day was making democracy great again when the elected leaders had to hide, being chased out of this Chamber doing the people's business? Is this an example of how the Republicans are going to bring the rule of law to D.C.? Give me a break. You have to be kidding me. To this day, Officer Sicknick's family--there were three officers who eventually died of causes related to the attack on the Capitol on January 6. Those families would hope that the people who were saved that day might be grateful. Those families lost their husbands, fathers, and sons. They simply want to have their sacrifice and law enforcement recognized by the people who were rescued. I know there are a number of my colleagues on the other side who had exemplary careers in law enforcement. They understand better than any that when you have a son, daughter, husband, or wife who gives their life in service of protecting the people in this Chamber, you would hope for at least just a small gesture, a plaque to commemorate that heroism and service to their country. That is not happening, and that is a shame. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
In January I gave the Government's backing to the lower Thames crossing. We have set out the allocation for the Department for Transport and the 10-year infrastructure plan. The Secretary of State for Transport will set out more detail in due course.
"I welcome the increase in defence spending. Will the Prime Minister take this opportunity to explain where the money is coming from, particularly as his Government continue to weaken our economy and when another expensive benefit U-turn--on top of the winter fuel U-turn--is on its way?"
"Oh, oh!"
"Mr. Speaker, after the lost Liberal decade of Justin Trudeau and company, our military is gutted, and Canada has been left weaker, poorer and defenceless. For 10 years, the Liberals failed to take our national defence and security seriously, instead relying on our allies to defend Canada's sovereignty. The Canadian Armed Forces is facing a devastating recruitment crisis and does not have enough soldiers, sailors and aircrew, and only half of our military equipment is serviceable. Why should Canadians believe the Prime Minister will fix what his Liberals have already broken?"
"Mr. Speaker, these are the same old Liberals, just another day. No one is talking about not investing in technology or developing industry. What we are opposing here is a mandate to remove the sale of gas-powered vehicles, a mandate opposed by industry leaders and industry experts and a mandate that would be opposed by Canadians as they see their costs rise at a time when they are already struggling to make ends meet."
"Mr. Speaker, I welcome my colleague back. I look forward to working with her in the upcoming months and hopefully years. We all care very much about the issues of seniors and ensuring that they have services and adequate pensions. All of those things are important. If we are able to transform the economy and move forward in the direction we are excited to go in, all Canadians will benefit, including our senior population, which is an important part of Canada and an area that all of us care about."
"Mr. Chair, my number one priority since being appointed to this role has been to bring forward Bill C-2 ."
"I just want to thank the leader on behalf of the people of Colorado and the people of Boulder for his remarks of concern. I share his commitment to making sure these sorts of terrorist attacks don't happen in our country when people are expressing their free speech rights. It is not surprising to me that the leader would be one of the very first people to the floor to raise the voices of the people of Colorado in this moment and the people of his State. Thank you, Leader."
"Mr. Speaker, I do recognize this reality. One of the best things that we can do as Canadians to lower global greenhouse gas emissions is displace coal in countries like China and India by shipping our clean natural gas to those countries. Actually, there have been reports that have shown that if we ship our natural gas overseas and displace more greenhouse gas-emitting fuel sources like coal or even wood in some countries, we can lower the entire greenhouse gas emission of Canada several times over. These are real solutions that can grow our economy but also lower global emissions."
"That is the end of the statement, which has been going on for about 90 minutes."
"It is very interesting to me, Mr. Speaker, that the Conservatives get up and decry the procedure on this very bill and then want to debate the next bill. We want to give them time to debate this bill. I am very interested as to why the member gets up and talks about other bills that may come before this House. Let us get down to business and do something for unions, for investors in this country, for investment—"
"Mr. Speaker, is it currently easier for a company in Ontario to export to the United States than it is to Quebec?"

"Mr. Chair, I think he is suggesting that it is Newfoundland and Labrador."
"Mr. Speaker, despite his speech about how this is a new government and a new face for the Liberals, the member for Winnipeg North has once again shown us through his repeated and often very frequent interventions that these are the same old Liberals with the same old scandals and the same old tendencies. Why is the member for Winnipeg North unable to commit to saying that his government will reimburse Quebec and Canadian taxpayers for the GC Strategies scandal?"
The hon. member.
Marvellous. I call Jim Shannon.
"Lord Ponsonby told the Justice Committee in February that the Government will set out a public position on reform of wedding laws, including humanist marriage, in the next few months. The Minister has said much the same today, but when will it happen, and will it include reform of current cohabitation laws, which disadvantage millions of couples?"
"Mr. Speaker, as I listen to the back and forth today, it feels like I caught my daughter with her hands in the cookie jar and I am hearing her trying to make excuses for emptying it. It feels like that is what the government is doing right now. They are trying to clear their conscience while those who were in the former government are still here. I will pick up on the question that my Conservative colleague asked about a disturbing trend. I replaced one of my colleagues on the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates a year or two ago. At the committee, I asked questions about the government's increasing use of outside consultants, because the media had published a figure about it. Using outside consultants costs more and is subject to fewer rules, less oversight and less accountability. When I asked my question, the government responded that the reason was a lack of expertise in the public service. I would like my colleague to explain this lack of vision to me. Why were outside consultants being used with the excuse given that there was a lack of expertise—"
The member will be able to continue his comments during questions and comments. The member for Central Newfoundland has the floor.
I call the shadow Secretary of State.
"I rise today to recognize and celebrate an extraordinary achievement by a remarkable young man from my district, Johntae Duncan, a vital member of the Walter H. Dyett High School for the Arts boys' basketball team, the Eagles. This team achieved a historic victory, winning the 2024-2025 Illinois High School Association (IHSA) Class 2A State Championship with a decisive 52-41 win over Althoff Catholic High School on March 15, 2025. This championship is more than just a win on the court; it is a profound testament to the resilience, determination, and unity of the Dyett High School community and the vibrant Bronzeville neighborhood. A decade ago, Dyett faced the threat of closure, but through powerful community advocacy and unwavering commitment, its doors remained open. Today, the Eagles' triumph, in which Johntae Duncan played a crucial role, symbolizes the incredible potential that flourishes when a community invests in its youth and its institutions. Johntae Duncan, along with his teammates, demonstrated exceptional skill, discipline, and teamwork throughout their season, navigating challenges and competing at the highest level. His hard work and dedication were integral to the team's success, culminating in this well-deserved championship that brings immense pride and joy to his school, family, and the entire community. I also extend my deepest gratitude to Head Coach Jamaal Gill, whose visionary leadershipand guidance steered the team to this historic victory, and to Assistant Coaches Kimani Harris, Pierre Adams, and Nathan Townsen, Jr., whose mentorship was vital to the players' development, community advocacy and unwavering commitment, its doors remained open. Today, the Eagles' triumph, in which Johntae Duncan played a crucial role, symbolizes the incredible potential that flourishes when a community invests in its youth and its institutions. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating Johntae Duncan and the entire Dyett High School boys' basketball team on their momentous achievement and in honoring them for the inspiration they provide to communities across our Nation."
"Madam Chair, the measure was going to reduce taxes by $800, but the cost of food is also going up by $800: $800 minus $800 equals zero. Canadians are not going to be better off. Will the minister please deliver a budget?"
"Under the Conservatives, London's housing crisis escalated to dangerous levels, with one child in every classroom in temporary accommodation. I warmly welcome not only the PS39 billion for the affordable homes programme, but the 10-year rent deal, the new low interest loans, and something that I have been pushing for--I can see that the Minister for Building Safety and Fire has just entered the Chamber--which is equal access to the building safety fund for housing associations, so that money can go towards improving conditions of homes and not to remediation. Can the Chancellor outline how this package will tackle London's housing crisis, including in my constituency, which is one of the most unequal parts, not only of London, but of the country."
"Mr. Chair, our focus with “build Canada homes” will be on tackling homelessness and investing in the most affordable housing we can for people who are homeless."
"Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that at this current time we are in a crisis, and we need to continue supporting our workers and our industries. CBAM is a very important part of that conversation, which came up at committee. I remember when the Conservatives were against any type of progressive environmental policy. We knew that it would hurt our workers at the end of the day, and we want to make sure that we remain competitive—"
"I very much welcome the commitment to city regions. Nationally, our city regions have underperformed on growth compared with continental cities. On South Yorkshire, I welcome the PS1.5 billion to restore and renew our tram network and to improve our bus services, but I understand from the mayor that discussions are still under way about a tram-train project to link Stocksbridge in the north to Beighton and Woodhouse in my constituency in the south. That project will unlock sites for housing and employment growth. Will my right hon. Friend agree to give further consideration to discussions with the mayor to unlock that extra funding for those growth projects?"
"Madam Chair, this is not my decision or that of the Minister of Public Safety. These decisions are made by Correctional Service Canada and are not subject in any way to my intervention."
I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lawler).
"today, I want to recognize a great American servant and one of my good friends, Curtis Bashaw. Curtis grew up in Camden County, New Jersey before earning his bachelor's degree and then going to the Ivy League to earn his Master's from the University of Pennsylvania. He has devoted his life to creating jobs and building opportunities in New Jersey and the United States, working in the real estate and hospitalities industry. As its Founder and Managing Partner, Curtis has done great work for Cape Resorts which is famous for focusing on restoration and operation of the classic Americanresort properties in the Northeast United States. Throughout his life, he has dedicated himself to strengthening communities and bringing people together to work for a common good. He is widely recognized for his leadership in the major restorations of the historic Congress Hall established in 1816 as well as the Virginia Hotel in Cape May, South Jersey. He has also helped to launch new creative programs to dramatically extend Cape May's tourism season, which has been a major catalyst for the economic rebirth of one of the Jersey Shore's most beautiful communities. God bless Curtis and God bless our United States of America. The greatest country in the world."
The hon. member for Saanich—Gulf Islands has the floor.
"Madam Speaker, at the outset, I will express my personal thoughts to the member regarding the situation that he found himself in and his opening comments. Having said that, I want to get clarification. Is it the position of Pierre Poilievre and the Conservative Party that they do not believe that seniors in Alberta, the Prairies, Ontario and Atlantic Canada should have received the rebate check back in April? Is that the position of the Conservative Party? Many of those individuals, in particular seniors and individuals on fixed incomes, would have been anticipating it and possibly incorporated it into their own budgets."
"The hon. Member will know that the Ministry of Defence recently published a written ministerial statement on how we can improve recruitment from the Commonwealth. It is not just about how we expand the pipeline coming into our armed forces; we also need to  recognise and support those who might be at the end of their service to get the support they need. We have a manifesto commitment to deliver that. The Defence Secretary has spoken to the Home Secretary about this, and our officials are in dialogue about it. I hope that the Minister for Veterans and People, who looks after this area, will be able to announce progress in due course. The hon. Member and I share a strong sense that there is a wrong to be righted here, and those people who serve our country for a good period of time should be able to settle here. I think progress will be made, but I recognise his interest in that happening. The magnificent VE Day commemorations, as well as the equally historic 80th anniversary of VJ Day in August, have been widely acknowledged as perhaps the last major opportunity to thank those who fought in the second world war. But we are also slowly losing the generation who did national service after the war and, with them, the living bridge they provide to our armed forces. We need to reconnect society with our armed forces and widen participation in national resilience. This weekend's festivities are a great way to kick-start that process, but, as our strategic defence review made clear, we have to be much more proactive as a country about rebuilding those connections, particularly with young people. Half of the Army's current crop of regimental sergeant majors were once cadets, so we will boost the cadet forces by 30% by 2030, creating opportunities for 42,000 more young people to be a cadet. We will introduce a voluntary gap year scheme for school and college leavers and develop a new UK strategic reserve by 2030--a fitting objective considering that yesterday was Reserves Day, when we were able to thank the many thousands of reservists who serve this country. They greatly bolster our capability at times of crisis, serving across defence, from the back office to the frontline. They give us the skills, scale and ability to meet the threats we face at home and overseas in a cost-effective way, as the Minister for Veterans and People can attest after serving alongside them on various tours. I have seen personally the enormous benefits that experience with our armed forces can offer people, particularly young people: purpose, adventure, social mobility, and a unique sense of camaraderie and self-achievement. For many people, it is a route to a much better life. We want to make many more young people aware of the opportunities on offer and the chance to see where service life can take them. As I noted earlier, we are taking decisive action to address the recruitment crisis that we inherited. The tortuously slow process that caused so much frustration is being transformed. For example, we have eliminated more than 100 outdated medical recruitment policies and we are slashing the time it takes to access medical records from weeks to hours. Our objective is to reduce the time of flight from application to starting at a training establishment. The new 10-30 policy introduced by the Secretary of State, which means applicants will get a decision on a provisional application within 10 days and a start date within 30 days, is a good step towards improving this process, but we know there is much more to do. Army recruitment has been completely restructured, and we have acted to keep hold of valued staff who are most at risk of leaving--for example, by introducing  retention payments for Army privates, lance corporals and aircraft engineers. The results speak for themselves: year-on-year inflow of recruits is up by 19% and outflow is down by 7%. The Royal Navy has exceeded its yearly recruitment target, and Royal Air Force applications are up by a third compared with early 2024. Applications to join the Army are at their highest level for seven years."
"Order. The Minister missed the Mexican wave that took place behind him. It was down to Chris Vince mostly, although probably it was also down to the length of the answers, which could be shorter."
"Mr. Chair, I really appreciate these questions from the colleagues across the way. I very much look forward to working with them to enhance our immigration system—"
"As the Home Secretary set out on Monday, anyone found to have been responsible for covering up or hiding vile crimes of child sexual abuse must and will be prosecuted. However, the Conservatives had a decade to act--the lost decade that Baroness Casey talked about--and the recommendations from Alexis Jay sat on a shelf without being acted on. This Government immediately brought forward the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill to deliver the biggest upgrade in child protection legislation in a generation--a Bill that the Conservatives opposed."
"Madam Speaker, I will repeat what I said earlier, because I do not know if my colleague heard me. It is imperative that we balance the future of stocks. We need to have a fishery to pass on to the next generation. At the same time, we need to understand that this is people's livelihood. We can do both, but we also need to ensure that we have a stock going forward."
"before I hopped on the Northeast Regional train to D.C. this morning, I joined Westchester County Executive Ken Jenkins to bring attention to the Trump administration's proposed 25 percent cut in funding the Amtrak Northeast Corridor service. This is a bad business decision that speaks more to politics than any objective analysis of what will grow the economy and jobs. In the congested corridor between Boston and D.C., where major businesses are headquartered and where we generate major revenue for this Nation, we don't need more cars on the road and more planes circling our airports. We can attract more Amtrak riders with modernization and upgrades, but this administration shows every day that if you don't support them and their policies, you don't count. They will remove Federal services from key cities, take away longtime tax deductions, impose their values and policies, and now curtail transportation options. Those of us who represent northeast and mid-Atlantic States get the message loud and clear: We don't count. Amtrak represents growth and expansion for America. When we treat it as such, we will see more of these benefits in other corridors."
"Mr. Chair, the minister called catch-and-release a myth. How does he explain repeat violent offenders' committing more crimes while on bail?"
"The hon. minister, briefly."
"The Bill still leaves over PS3.5 billion of cuts falling on disabled people and unpaid carers, with hundreds of thousands of new claimants set to lose thousands of pounds each year. Protections for existing claimants are welcome, but a two-tier system will generate hardship for many and create societal divisions. We are being asked to vote without vital evidence--without the Office for Budget Responsibility impact assessment, or the Timms and Mayfield reviews. Serious questions remain unanswered, and we are without clarity on outcomes and implementation. Will the Secretary of State continue to listen, withdraw this Bill, and co-design welfare reform with disabled people's groups?"
"Order. Please! It has not been a good day so far, and I do not want any more interruptions."
"Does my hon. Friend share my concern for the children in all our constituencies who, after losing nearly two years of face-to-face schooling, are still suffering set-backs in their learning and their social skills? Will he join me in  calling on the Government to channel investment into those who were at school during those years of disruption, to ensure that there is not a lost generation in this country?"
"Mr. Speaker, in a 10-minute speech, there have already been two interruptions. I would encourage members to be a little more courteous. I would suggest taking a look at the legislation. I referenced Bill C-4 , and it would be a tax break for Canadians not only in terms of their tax policy but also in terms of first-time homebuyers. First-time homebuyers who are purchasing a new home would actually get a GST exemption on it, up to a significant amount of a tax break for those first-time homebuyers, thereby making homes more affordable and ultimately increasing the number of houses being built. These are substantial legislation measures and substantial budgetary measures that we have seen in a very short window. We made an investment, for example, of two—"
"I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2987, the CEASE Act, because it has the potential to harm our Nation's most underserved small businesses. This bill would cap the number of Small Business Lending Company, or SBLC, licenses that the SBA can issue at its current level of 16 licenses. These licenses enable lenders to make loans of up to $5 million to small businesses that we know often struggle to secure financing from traditional banks. If Republicans wanted to find a solution to bipartisan concerns about SBA's capacity to oversee an increased number of licenses, Democrats would have been happy to work together on this. Unfortunately, this bill fails to address our serious concerns about how it could devastate opportunities for capital access for the small businesses that need SBA's help the most. Specifically, this bill is completely silent about how this cap on licenses would impact Community Advantage SBLCs. We know that one of small businesses' greatest challenges is obtaining access to financial capital. For over a decade now, the Community Advantage program has been helping close this funding gap for underserved businesses who face this challenge disproportionately like rural, veteran, and low-income small business owners. I will never forget visiting one of these businesses in Santa Monica, California. It was a salad-based restaurant owned by two young Hispanic men who had this dream of expanding their restaurant, but they were turned away by every traditional bank due to a lack of assets and credit history. Finally, they were able to get a $250,000 Community Advantage loan, and now they have six of these restaurants. It was a relatively modest sum, but $250,000 was what it took to make these small business owners successful, and that is why I have long believed in the Community Advantage program. However, it was operating only as a pilot program, and that is why I sponsored a bill to make it permanent. This bipartisan bill has passed out of the House, but the Senate did not take it up. Great relief, however, came in 2023 when the SBA established by rule the Community Advantage SBLC programto provide long-term assurance for the program and lenders. Since then, there has been great progress: 143 lenders have registered as Community Advantage SBLCs. In 2024 alone, these lenders have already issued 1,100 loans totaling $196 million to the most underserved small businesses with an average loan size of $160,000. Congress needs to build on these efforts by providing statutory permanency for Community Advantage, but the bill before us today goes in the opposite direction, potentially threatening the future of Community Advantage SBLCs because it makes no mention of how these licenses would be impacted by the statutory cap. Congress must ensure that our most underserved small businesses have the resources they need to not just survive but to grow. That is why I will reintroduce the Community Advantage Loan Program Act, which will give permanent authorization to this program. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support our Nation's veteran, rural, and low-income entrepreneurs by voting ``no'' on this bill."
I call the shadow Minister.
"We are working towards resetting the entire regulatory framework, as the hon. Gentleman may have seen from Sir Jon Cunliffe's report, published today. He is absolutely right, though: under the previous Government, the regulator was absolutely toothless. That is why one of the first pieces of legislation this Government passed was the Water (Special Measures) Act 2025, which gave the regulator the power it lacked previously to ban the unfair and unjustified multimillion-pound bonuses that so outraged the public as those companies profited from pollution."
"Mr. Speaker, my generation refuses to live in a shipping container. Oxford Economics reported yesterday that Toronto's housing market ranks among the worst in the world for affordability. At the same time, mortgage delinquency rates in Toronto are now higher than at any time during the pandemic. The financial burden is suffocating the next generation of homebuyers, and history has shown us that if we fail to plan, we are planning to fail. A budget is a plan. My question for the Prime Minister is, when will Canadians see one?"
We are developing proposals that will minimise costs and ensure a fair outcome for consumers throughout the country.
"The Government remain committed to providing existing leaseholders with greater rights, powers and protections over their homes. We commenced the right-to-manage measures contained in the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024 on 3 March. We remain firmly committed to tackling unregulated and unaffordable ground rents, and we will deliver that in legislation. We will set out further detail on our proposed approach to enabling the conversion of existing leaseholds to commonhold in our draft leasehold and commonhold reform Bill later this year."
"I thank the hon. Member for advance notice of his point of order. I can assure him and the House that nothing irregular or, indeed, unusual took place last night. It is usual for the Speaker to give provisional advance notice of amendments and new clauses that are expected to be selected for separate decision. However, it is not infrequent for the Chair to make changes based on new information that comes to light during the course of the debate, particularly when the lead signatory to an amendment or new clause indicates that they do not wish to move it. Only an amendment or new clause that has been moved by a Member needs to be withdrawn with the leave of the House before the Question is put. This only applies to the lead amendment or new clause in any group. In this instance, the Member had not been called to move the new clause, so there was nothing to withdraw. It is wholly appropriate and normal for the Chair to decide not to call a new clause or amendment for a separate decision when the lead signatory has indicated they do not wish to move it. Ideally, this indication should have been made in the course of the debate by the Member who tabled the new clause. The hon. Member for Hamble Valley (Paul Holmes) knows very well how to touch base with the Table Clerks and the staff in the Speaker's Office."
"Mr. Chair, in the minister's plan, what is the number of people who are supposed to leave in the next three years?"
"moved: That, given that the Auditor General found that ArriveCAN contractor, GCStrategies Inc., was paid $64 million from the Liberal government, and in many cases, there was no proof that any work was completed, the House call on the government to: (a) get taxpayers their money back, within 100 days of the adoption of this motion; and (b) impose a lifetime contracting ban on GCStrategies Inc., any of its subsidiaries, its founders Kristian Firth and Darren Anthony, and any other entities with which those individuals are affiliated. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise and address this important matter for Canadians, following the report by Canada's Auditor General. Before I get into the substantive portion of my remarks and making a case for the imperative of getting Canadians their money back and having a lifetime ban for the contractors involved and the principals of the contracting firm in question, I want to inform the Chair that I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Edmonton West . It is a privilege to split my time with this member. We often talk about His Majesty's loyal opposition being a government in waiting, and interestingly, there was an exchange recently between the right hon. Prime Minister , who is new to this place, and the member for Edmonton West , who is an experienced parliamentarian. The Prime Minister, perhaps in jest but certainly exposing his lack of familiarity with members of the official opposition, said that the member for Edmonton West did not understand how things worked in this place and did not know the difference between a budget and estimates. I want to offer a bit of history to the Prime Minister, because it is really important the Prime Minister understands who is holding him to account. The member for Edmonton West has an office complement that is the same size as those of all members in this House. Ministers, of course, get much larger offices. They get politically exempt staff, and they get access to full departments. The member for Edmonton West has a couple people who work in his office, just as the rest of us do. I do not know how many people work at the Department of Finance, but there are a lot; there are thousands of them. In 2018, a budget was tabled in the House, and the member for Edmonton West, on his own, in doing his due diligence reviewing the budget, found that the minister of finance and the ministry made an error of about $150 million. The hon. member was able to correct the homework of the government, the minister, their staff and the entire ministry when they laid that budget on the table. When we bring things before this House, it is because we have done our due diligence and because we are going to do what we have always done, which is punch above our weight. As the Liberals have the weight of the entire public service and have all the extra resources that come with serving in government, there are incredible responsibilities to get things right, to make sure they get value for taxpayers and to make sure that when mistakes are made, they are corrected, and that when value is not received, it is corrected. What we saw in the Auditor General's reports this week confirms what Canada's Conservatives had raised the alarm bell about in the previous Parliament. On a range of issues the Auditor General looked at, she found that there were massive cost overruns and in fact negligence by the Liberal government, specifically in the use of the contractor GC Strategies, which was the preferred contractor in what is now known as the arrive scam scandal. This was the app the government originally pegged at costing $80,000. It ultimately cost many orders of magnitude more than that, in excess of $64 million. Value for money just was not there. For context and for new members to this place, it is important to note that when the official opposition initially raised concerns about the ArriveCAN app, the Liberals said that the app worked great, that it worked as intended and that they received value for money and had no regrets. They paraded people through committee over and over again with that refrain, but it turns out that simply was not the case. The then leader of the opposition, Mr. Poilievre, called for an Auditor General investigation, and there was a vote in the House. The Liberals and the cabinet, which is the executive responsible for this project, this massive boondoggle, voted against having the Auditor General take a look at it. Why would they not want the investigation if they were so proud of the project and it had worked as intended? Of course, they knew that it was a corrupt process, and they did not want it to come to light, but we did our work in holding the government to account, checking its homework, and we found the errors. We found the grift that had occurred. It is not just about the nearly $100 million in contracts that GC Strategies was awarded, as a company owned by Mr. Kristian Firth and Mr. Darren Anthony; it is about the procurement processes that were not followed. Let us take for example the imperative of security clearances. The contracts this company was awarded required security clearances. I use the term “company” loosely as these were a couple of guys working in their basement, getting multi-million dollar IT contracts from the Government of Canada, but they were not IT experts. Some of the departments they worked for included public safety, CBSA and national defence. The Auditor General found that in 50% of contracts requiring security clearances, departments cannot prove that these workers, subcontractors for GC Strategies, had the security clearance, and in over 20% of contracts, workers were actively on the job without a valid security clearance. The Liberal government is not one that takes security seriously if this is what it deems an acceptable procurement practice. Anyone who has ever had a project done at home, if they get a deck built at their house and they put a deposit down and the work is complete and satisfactory, they pay the contractor and thank them for their hard work. What is going to be shocking for Canadians is what we saw here; in 46% of the contracts, there was no proof of work delivered, but the government paid in 100% of the cases. It is unacceptable, and we know it is because no household would do it, no small business would do it and certainly the Government of Canada should not have done it. What we are asking for is reasonable, but it is also the minimum expectation that Canadians have of us, as Parliament: Within 100 days of the passage of this motion, the government would get Canadians their money back and not simply let it stand that the company involved in this fraud not be allowed to bid on government contracts for seven years; rather, the company, its principals and subsidiaries would have a lifetime ban from doing work for the Government of Canada on behalf of Canadians. This is what Canadians expect of us. We will hear the rise of all kinds of partisan hackles over the course of today, but this is a great opportunity. We are going to hear that it is a new Liberal government. If it is, then it is time for the Liberals to let us smell that new-car smell, that new-government smell; rise above the partisanship, the instinct to oppose this for the sake of opposing it; and vote for this common-sense motion. Let us get Canadians their money back, get accountability by banning these contractors. Let us show Canadians that when we tax them a dollar, it is going to go as far as it can, and if someone takes advantage of the Government of Canada and Canadians, we will not let it stand."
"Happy birthday, Mr Speaker. The Energy Secretary has said that there is a ""principled case"" for removing green taxes from electricity bills, and the cost being met by increases in green taxes on gas bills. That would be a net tax rise for every household--80% of the country--that uses gas. This was not an argument that he made before the election, so can the Minister take this opportunity to rule out any increase in taxes, charges or levies on gas bills?"
"The Foreign Secretary will understand my question, because I wrote to him on 18 June asking if he would meet Dr Mohammed Mustafa, who has assembled a children's hospital in prefabricated form in Jordan and is ready to go into Gaza. It will be able to help the 400,000 children in northern Gaza who have no access to any medical facilities at all at the moment. This is desperately urgent. Will the Minister meet Dr Mustafa to familiarise himself with the opportunity here of doing something practical and good to help desperate children in northern Gaza?"
"I am afraid to say that the past week has been another horror show for the Government. This is Armed Forces Week, as the House will know. It is a time to celebrate and champion all those who serve and have served in our armed forces, and nowhere more than in my own county of Herefordshire. We must also note that, far from celebrating the armed forces, this Government deliberately opened the door last year to unfair and vexatious prosecutions of veterans who served decades ago in Northern Ireland, and they have kept that door open. What else? The original Abortion Act was debated for more than a year, but the Government allowed no notice for public debate on the abortion amendment last week, and they gave just two hours of debate in the Chamber on the biggest change in abortion law in nearly 60 years. Whatever one thinks of the merits of the issue, that is a scandalously bad way to make legislation. What else? Defence Ministers were left out of the loop on the US bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities, and were unable to say whether they supported this action by our closest ally. A Government Whip resigned, expressing her deep concerns over the welfare Bill, and the Government have promised to bring the Bill forward next week, as we have just heard--let us see if they do. Talking of U-turns, the Government, having only just U-turned on the winter fuel payment, and again on grooming gangs last week, have prepared themselves for a U-turn on the two-child benefit cap less than a year since they suspended seven Labour MPs for voting against the cap. This is just one week. Is it any wonder that the Prime Minister's personal reputation has continued to plummet? Only yesterday, The Times of London said: ""Not quite a year has passed since his landslide general election victory and already his political stock is trading at junk status, akin to a Zimbabwean dollar or Weimar papiermark."" Mr Speaker, you may recall from your intimate knowledge of German history that the papiermark was a monetary instrument that led to hyper-inflation and political collapse. That is coming from The Times of London. Shall we dig a little bit further into one specific reason why the Prime Minister's reputation might have fallen so much? Following the record pay settlements of last year, the junior doctors have announced that they are ""excited"" at the idea of six months of strike action. Meanwhile, hospital consultants are balloting to see if they will strike as well. Doctors received a 22% increase last year after Labour took office, and now the junior doctors are apparently demanding a further pay increase of 29%. These are eye-watering numbers and, of course, we will all end up paying if the increases are granted, but I am afraid this is exactly what we would expect from a Government who have taxed and splurged the cash since the election. It is hardly surprising that the unions now think they have an open door to extract money from the Treasury, and the Government have actually made the situation even worse through their rolling programme of nationalisation, and by abolishing NHS England. Whatever else it may have been, NHS England acted as a firebreak on union lobbying, because it operated semi-independently of Ministers. By abolishing it, the Government have now removed one of the few means they had to face down extortionate demands for more pay and more restrictive practices. The same is true with the railways: as each one is nationalised--including South West Railway only last week--so the obstacles to the unions' demands are progressively being removed. The House will recall the massive pay settlements given to the rail unions last year, with no attempt to negotiate any efficiency gains. It is only a matter of time before those unions come back for more, as the doctors are doing. These are not pay bargains; they are an abject surrender. Of course, Ministers themselves do not mind--after all, 90% of them are reported to be union members. As far as I can see, the Leader of the House is an exception: she is not a union member, and all credit to her for that."
"Mr. Speaker, he is settling into old Liberal habits of not being bothered by wasting taxpayers' money and funnelling it to his friends. The Prime Minister is trying to act like he is new to the job or he just got here. He was Justin Trudeau's senior economic adviser while the contracts were being handed out. The Minister responsible for Canada-U.S. Trade , the Minister of Jobs and the Minister of Foreign Affairs all have their fingerprints on the scandal, and he chose them to sit around his cabinet table. Why is it that every time the Liberals get caught in a corruption scandal, Liberal politicians get rewarded and taxpayers get the bill?"
"Mr. Chair, the situation for our forest products industry is indeed challenging. As I have said in many of my comments, it is the canary in the coal mine. The forest products industry is currently on its fifth version of trade wars with the United States. We have contested this in adjudication, and we have won four times. They just keep coming back. We will support the forest products industry, but this is what Donald Trump is doing systematically across all of the economy today. We will provide, in these estimates, $1 billion of support for the forest products industry in terms of innovation, data collection, wildfire fighting and pest control."
"I can confirm that we do not need any permission to make policy decisions. I think that if we did, the Israeli Government would have a rather different attitude towards Britain's Minister for the Middle East. The position in relation to recognition is that we wish to provide a state in which Palestinians can live safe and secure, side by side with the Israelis. That looks distant at the moment, for the reasons that my hon. Friend has given. Those reasons need to be addressed. We want to see progress, and we will consider our own position as part of the best possible way in which we can make a contribution."
"Mr. Speaker, I will give in French the same answer I just gave in English to my esteemed Conservative colleague. We just had an election. The first page of the election platform of the party currently in power states that we need to act quickly in the interest of the Canadian economy, first, to create one economy out of 13 and enrich every individual Canadian, and second, to quickly implement major projects from coast to coast."
"One way of ensuring that new unitary authorities such as those for Leicestershire have adequate funding is to base that funding on robust business cases. Given that the Department was five weeks late in providing feedback to the local authorities, will the Minister commit to extending the deadline to ensure that those local authorities have the time that they need to build up those plans?"
"Let me give the shadow Secretary of State a much-needed education, because he appears not to know that under the Tory Government violence  on staff in our prisons soared and experienced officers left in droves because of it. That is the inheritance I received, and that is the mess that this Government are clearing up. He will know that I have already acted on suspending the use of self-cook facilities, and Jonathan Hall is looking into the HMP Frankland attack. I have made the announcement on body armour, and I will not hesitate to take any further action, but unlike him I will not take ""headline-grabbing"" measures, just for the sake of a headline."
"I thank the Minister for his statement, and for the extensive time he spent with the Work and Pensions Committee last week. Our inquiry on pensioner poverty has found that this issue is multifaceted and complex. Can the Minister assure me that he will work cross-Government on a policy that will ensure that pensioner poverty is a thing of the past?"
"I rise to congratulate Dominique Claseman and Ahren Jurgensen of Olivia, Minnesota, on raising nearly $120,000 for a veterans memorial in their hometown. Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, Dominique raised over $77,000 to construct a memorial for veterans. Since then, he has enlisted in the U.S. Army and is currently completing his basic training. In less than a year, his younger brother, Ahren, who also intends to join the military after high school, raised $40,000 to expand on the memorial, installing additional plaques, benches, flags, and pavers. I congratulate Dominique and Ahren on their amazing achievements, and I thank them for their service to their community and to their country.  Celebrating Lawrence Weinrich's 100th Birthday"
Order. I give Members notice that I will take the time limit down to four minutes after the next speaker.
"What a great initiative by Doug Smith to set up Volunteers Count; I am sure we all recognise that it is a really good and important way of collecting this data and information. The subject of volunteering gets raised with me every week, and I am sure that a debate, probably on the Floor of the House, to celebrate our volunteers would be very well attended."
"Mr. Speaker, building on Bill C-48 , which made substantive changes to Bill C-75 , creating the reverse onus, and working with the provinces and territories, we are going to strengthen it; we are going to go further. The Prime Minister has said we are going to go even further as it relates to judicial and court reform."
"I rise today to honor the life and legacy of a dear friend of mine and a fixture in the Surfside Beach community, Mr. Robert Franklin Childs III, known to most as Bob. Originally born in Washington, D.C., he spent 37 years working on Capitol Hill, starting in the electrical engineering department under the Architect of the Capitol. After retiring from the Hill, Bob and his wife, Nancy, moved to Surfside Beach. There he continued his career in public service as the mayor of Surfside Beach from 2016 to 2020. He also servedon the Surfside Beach Town Council, the board of directors for the Horry County Council on Aging and the Waccamaw Regional Council of Governments. He brought honesty and common sense to local government and was loved by all. When you look at the iconic Surfside Beach pier, know that it was Bob's tireless efforts, advocacy, and grit that rebuilt it after devastating hurricanes impacted our region. Bob was an incredibly hard worker, and his passion for improving the lives of those around him always remained constant. Bob was an incredible person, too. He believed in passing the baton, in helping people, people who wanted to serve their community. Bob was a constant voice in their ear for good public service. He was the kind of man who lived his values, not just in words, but in the way he treated others. May his memory leave a lasting legacy for all those who knew him."
"I am grateful to the right hon. Member for putting square the economic interests that we have at this time and highlighting why diplomacy is so important against that backdrop. The price of oil has jumped to $78 a barrel, and some are predicting it going up to $125 a barrel--that would certainly be the case if the strait of Hormuz were blocked. That is why this is so delicate. Let us be under no doubt that this affects British people at the pump and that there would be massive inflationary growth if that were to happen."
"Mr. Speaker, my apologies to the interpreters. I was saying that, with today's motion, what the Conservatives are proposing is to hold Quebec back from its transition to a low-carbon economy and have our investments go to waste. It is simple: The Manichaean view would be that the Conservatives want us in an oil and gas stranglehold. We saw that in the previous Parliament, and they are doing it again. The Conservatives constantly defend oil and gas tooth and nail. Quebec should remain dependent on oil and gas instead of developing its own clean electricity infrastructures. That would make absolutely no sense. That is what I do not understand. Why should we electrify transportation? Oil sands development is the industry with the highest greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. Transportation is another major emitter. The electrification of transportation will reduce the consumption of fuel, along with our GHG emissions. If anyone does not believe that, they do not believe in climate change. Even worse, it is an essential economic driver in Quebec. I myself have an electric vehicle. Some people would have us believe that electric vehicles are nothing but trouble. That is nonsense. I live in the Saguenay, precisely 665 kilometres from Parliament. I can get here with my car. I have to stop for 20 minutes to charge it at a rapid charging station, then I can continue on my way. Typically, stopping for 20 minutes during a six-and-a-half-hour drive is not a luxury, so there is no reason, with today's new technologies, not to drive a electric vehicle. What the Conservatives want, however, is to keep people dependent on oil and gas. I see this motion as an extension of what we have seen in the past. Former Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is a master at coming up with populist ideas that make no sense. Today the Conservatives are attacking electric vehicles. They are using the slogan of Quebec's Conservative Party: “My car, my choice”. It seems to be a matter of identity for the Conservatives. I understand that we can have polarizing debates. Some people are pro-life, others are pro-choice. They are pro-gas, so they disagree with those who are pro-electricity. I do not understand how a serious party can introduce a motion like this. However, what is most important is that today the Conservatives are trying to defend the oil and gas industry. They are on-side with the government on Bill C‑5 to defend the oil and gas industry tooth and nail. Ultimately, the Conservative Party's rhetoric is similar to the Bloc Québécois's rhetoric: if it is good for Quebec, if it does not harm Quebec, we support it. In their case, if it is good for the oil and gas industry, if it does not harm the oil and gas sector, they support it. Otherwise, they oppose it. This motion is just one example of that."
"Mr. Speaker, standing here today and representing my community in the 45th Parliament is the honour of a lifetime. I want to begin by expressing my deepest gratitude to the people of Kitchener Centre for placing their trust in me. Their voices, their concerns and their aspirations are at the heart of everything I will do in Ottawa. I also want to take a moment to recognize the dedicated volunteers who made this journey possible. Their passion, hard work and unwavering commitment carried me to this moment. I am not standing here alone; each and every one of them is here with me. My husband, Chris, my mom, my closest friends, my dad and my daughter, Abigail, are my strength, my motivation and my greatest supporters. Their love and belief in me have guided me every step of this path, and I am forever grateful. To my predecessor Mike, I say thanks for his service to Kitchener Centre. I will continue to be a strong advocate. Kitchener Centre is more than a place on a map. It is where I was raised; it is where my heart belongs. I attended J F Carmichael, then Queensmount, and went off to Forest Heights, before completing my education at Conestoga, where I earned a diploma in mechanical engineering, specializing in robotics and automation. My career in management has spanned over 18 years, focusing on effective communication, fiscal responsibility and policy creation to improve efficiencies. These are principles I will carry with me into public service. I grew up in a home where money was not plentiful, but resilience and determination were abundant. I was taught the value of hard work, ambition and the belief that, with effort, anything was possible. That was the Canada and the home that I grew up in, a place where dedication and perseverance could lead to home ownership, financial security and a good life in a safe neighbourhood. Today, those dreams feel farther out of reach for many. This reality is one that I will fight to change. I am committed to building a future in which affordability is not an obstacle, jobs provide stability and communities are free from the devastating impacts of addiction and crime. I am here to listen. I am here to act. I am here to make sure that every person in Kitchener Centre has the opportunity to thrive. The rising cost of living has tightened its grip on families, young professionals and seniors alike. I heard the stories at the doors: parents stretching every dollar, young people questioning whether they can afford a home or local businesses trying to stay afloat amid increasing expenses. Affordability is not just a word; it is the difference between stability and struggle, between hope and hardship. During the campaign, I had the opportunity to tour the Waterloo regional food bank. While I was deeply impressed by its efficiency and dedication, I found myself grappling with the unsettling reality, the sheer scale at which such an operation is needed in our community. Between 2023 and 2024, the number of new households accessing food hamper programs for the first time skyrocketed by 210%. In that same period, 29,786 hampers were distributed to families in need, for an increase of 109%. These staggering numbers are a direct consequence of the rising cost of living, which is forcing more and more people to turn to essential support services just to put food on the table. This is not just an economic issue; it is a human one. It is a call to action that demands urgent and meaningful solutions to ensure that no family in Kitchener Centre or beyond has to struggle for their basic needs. We must forge policies that ease this pressure, ensuring less taxation, affordable housing and stability for our communities across Canada. Equally vital is my commitment to job creation. Kitchener Centre has long been a hub of innovation, with a thriving tech industry and entrepreneurial spirit. However, opportunity must be more than a promise. It must be a reality for every worker, every student choosing to stay in the region while entering the workforce and every small business daring to dream. We must invest in key technologies and industries: green technology, the arts and creative sectors, advanced manufacturing, med tech, deep tech, AI and more. We need to implement policies that empower our people and drive investment, ensuring our economy is sustainable and future-proof. Today, our community has an opportunity to forge a new path ahead, and we are well positioned to do so. We must support the initiatives of the leaders of our industries on a federal level to ensure a prosperous future for Kitchener Centre. However, amid these ambitions, I must address the harsh reality that so many of our neighbours face: this drug crisis. It is a crisis that is not just statistical and not economic; it is profoundly human. I have listened to the voices of families who have lost loved ones; frontline business owners and workers grappling with its impact; and communities, especially in our downtown core, caught in the crossfire of addiction and crime. One conversation that deeply resonated with me was with Cynthia, a constituent from Kitchener Centre. Not only has her business suffered because of this crisis, but she also brought to my attention a critical issue: the Alexandrian. It is a residential building in the heart of our downtown, which is not alone. This building is home to many newcomers to Canada and low-income families, including children of all ages. These children deserve to grow up in a safe and nurturing environment, yet they are exposed to the harsh daily realities of downtown life. Criminal activity unfolds right in front of them as they wait for the school bus or play in the nearby park. This is unacceptable. The safety of all of our children must never be an afterthought. It is our responsibility to ensure that they can live, learn and play in communities free from fear. The solution is not stigma; the solution is compassion and treatment. We must expand access to mental health support, strengthen rehabilitation programs and ensure that no one falls through the cracks. I recently had the opportunity to speak with members of our outstanding Waterloo Regional Police Service, who shared with me that in 2024 alone, they responded to over 11,000 incidents in our downtown core. Since January, the WRPS has been actively collaborating with our local BIA on initiatives aimed at addressing these challenges and enhancing community well-being. To further support these efforts, we must take a firm stance on crime and repeal the soft-on-crime provisions in Bill C-5 and Bill C-75 . These policies have made it more difficult to hold repeat offenders accountable and have contributed to a revolving door in our justice system. We need to ensure that individuals who repeatedly victimize our communities are kept off our streets and that those responsible for trafficking deadly substances such as fentanyl face the most severe penalties, including life sentences for kingpins. I did not enter public service to offer empty words. I am here to work for the single parent balancing two jobs, for those living under the poverty line, for the young graduate searching for stability, for the entrepreneur building something new and for the countless individuals wanting a second chance. Kitchener Centre is not just my riding; it is my heart, and I vow to work for it with every ounce of my dedication. To my fellow representatives in the House, I say let us move forward with courage and conviction. Let us not simply acknowledge these challenges but solve them. Let us prove through action that public service is more than governance: It is the unwavering pursuit of a better future. Together we can build it."
"I congratulate the 457 graduates of Briar Woods High School class of 2025. In their time as Falcons, they have put time and effort into classes, sports activities, and clubs while building lifelong friendships. They have excelled in a wide range of fields this year. The football team went to the State championship. Seventeen students in the DECA chapter qualified for the International Career Development Conference. The theater program took home awards at the Blue Ridge Glamies for ``Hello, Dolly!'' The graduating class of 2025 was awarded a total of $6.7 million in scholarships and grants, and that is really impressive. I congratulate the entire class of 2025, and I know they will carry what they learned at Briar Woods into the future.  {time}  1910  Congratulating Broad Run High School Class of 2025"
"Mr. Speaker, I have answered that question before, and I will answer it again. It is not my job, as the Minister of Environment, to choose the projects. We had the premiers and the Prime Minister sit down and talk about what national unity looks like. My job is—"
"We cannot help but be excited about the Bill because of its potential to deliver. The Minister is a good friend of us in Northern Ireland, and a good friend of all of us in this Chamber and across this great nation. There are innovative people in Northern Ireland who have the technology, and they wish to play their part. Is it the Minister's intention to ensure that everyone across this great United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has the opportunity to feed into SAF and to gain the benefit from it?"
"The thoughts of the whole House will be with those affected by the plane crash in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, and the emergency services at the scene. I thank the Foreign Secretary for assuring us about the assistance that will be given to the families affected. As we know, British nationals are involved. On the statement, I pay tribute to the Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, and his team for the constructive way they have approached this issue. They worked constructively with Ministers in the previous Conservative Government to set out the negotiating position and red lines, the UK having recognised the choices that Gibraltar made in its interests. The Chief Minister stated in a letter to the former European Scrutiny Committee that ""the UK and Gibraltar have never worked more closely together in delivering the outcome that the People of Gibraltar want"". As my noble Friend Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton said when he gave evidence to the Committee last year: ""Fabian Picardo and I are joined at the hip: we will not agree anything that we are not both comfortable with."" The Foreign Secretary has acknowledged his predecessor's work and taken time to reflect on it and secure this outcome. Will he also acknowledge that this negotiating process has been frustrated by Spain, which, as we know, blocked these issues from being resolved through the Brexit negotiations? His Majesty's Opposition will judge the deal agreed on whether it meets the aims and objectives that we outlined when in government with Gibraltar and once we see the full details. Our principles have been that nothing compromises or infringes on the sovereignty and constitutional arrangements of Gibraltar, which is to remain British. We believe that we must able to operate our base as we have done to safeguard our defence and interest, and that the deal must be backed by the Government of Gibraltar and Gibraltar's people to support their interests. It must also address the concerns about the actions of Spain to frustrate and prevent the free flow of goods. I heard what the Foreign Secretary said in his statement and in the joint statement from the Government of Gibraltar, the UK Government and the EU Commission. I have the following questions. Can the Foreign Secretary confirm when the House will get to see the full details of the deal and the treaty? In a letter to the House of Lords International Agreements Committee, the Minister responsible for the Indo-Pacific, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Friern Barnet (Catherine West), commented on the benefits to scrutiny of sharing the initial treaty text in advance of its being laid formally. Given the importance of the issue, will the Foreign Secretary make a draft available to the House before signing, and will he commit to make parliamentary time available to debate the treaty? Can the Foreign Secretary confirm whether the red lines that the last Government set with the Government of Gibraltar have been met or whether, during the negotiations and since he took office last year, there has been any divergence from them? Can he give assurances that under this deal we will see a stop to the games that have been played by the Spanish that disrupt the border and the freedoms that Gibraltarians should enjoy? They cause disruption in the EU, so has he received commitments from Spain and the EU that this will never happen again? With in excess of 15,000 people crossing the border every day, it is vital for economic interests that a fluid border, which Gibraltar wants, is in place. That is why when we were in government we respected the choice of Gibraltar to work to achieve this. No mention is made of the military base in the joint statement, but the Foreign Secretary has referenced it. Can he confirm that nothing will be agreed that infringes on our ability to operate the base, and will members of our armed forces be able to access Gibraltar without needing Schengen checks? On the juxtaposed border controls, can he give more details about their practical operation and explain to the House how they will work? Can Spanish officers stop a British citizen from coming to stay in Gibraltar? Will British citizens' time staying in Gibraltar count against the 90-day Schengen limit? Finally, the joint statement issued lists areas that the agreement will include, covering state aid, taxation, the environment, transport, the rights of frontier workers, social security co-operation and financial mechanisms on training and employment. However, there is a lack of detail. When will the details come forward, and when will we be able to scrutinise them? Does this put Gibraltar in a customs union with the EU? What does this mean for VAT? Will there be any provisions that will require Gibraltar or the United Kingdom to pass legislation, including to enact any EU law? Conservatives will always defend British sovereignty and the rights of Gibraltar, and we will continue to scrutinise the details of this deal so that nothing undermines this."
"I reassure the right hon. Gentleman that there will be a full debate in this House in the coming days as part of the proscription process, so in due course he and all Members will have an opportunity to debate in full the proscription decision the Home Secretary has taken. I can tell him that the decision to proscribe has not been made without considerable thought, or without reflecting on the information in the public domain and information that perhaps is not, and that it was underpinned by a very serious legal process. I would agree with his concern, but I seek to reassure him that those matters have been considered as part of the process."
"Mr. Speaker, one of the things I have been hearing from businesses across the country, including businesses in southwestern Ontario, is that our barriers to interprovincial trade are so high that often, after a business was strong enough to expand beyond its local market, the first thing a Canadian business would think to do was export to the United States. That is very much true of southwestern Ontario with its strong cross-border trade. That is one of the reasons the legislation is so timely and so appropriate. As we are facing tariff barriers from south of the border, now is the moment to make it frictionless for our businesses, including businesses in southwestern Ontario, to trade with other Canadians. It is what we need to do."
"Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that the United Kingdom is an important trade partner for Canada. Currently, we have a system in place to give us access to 99% of its market. It is working really well. I sat down with the trade minister when I was in Paris last week to open discussions on coming to a trade agreement. Right now, we have access to 99% of its market."
"Mr. Speaker, it is with sincere and profound respect that New Democrats add our voices to honour the life and legacy of our colleague, the Hon. Marc Garneau, a trailblazer, a patriot, a devoted public servant and an exceptional human being. As Canada's first astronaut, Mr. Garneau soared beyond our world, embodying the spirit of exploration and the pursuit of knowledge. His historic journey inspired a nation and marked a global milestone in our country's scientific achievements. We are still inspired by his wise words about Earth. He said that it is our home and we must take care of it. Mr. Garneau dedicated himself to public service and this Parliament with resolve and grace. As member and minister, he demonstrated by word and by action that it is possible to go beyond partisanship for the betterment of Canada. Throughout, he displayed an unwavering commitment to improving life for Canadians. In his quiet way, he stood courageously for his principles, often supporting opposition colleagues with words of encouragement. The NDP especially appreciated his support for better mental health and addictions policies in this House, and he backed that up by voting for those principles, sometimes against his own party. His leadership was characterized by integrity, rationality and decency. Though possessed of a prodigious intellect, he comported himself with modesty and humour. He was one who truly earned the title “Honourable”. The passing of Marc Garneau is a profound loss for our country. We extend deepest condolences to Marc's wife Pam, his children, his family, our colleagues in the Liberal Party and all who were touched by his remarkable life. May his legacy continue to inspire future generations to reach for the stars and to serve with honour. I thank him and say farewell."
"Mr. Speaker, it is nice to hear that the Conservatives are finally recognizing that we are talking about an industry that is facing unjustified tariffs from the United States. However, let us also talk about how our auto sector is important. We need to support it in this moment. It is creating well-paying union jobs in our country. An EV standard actually makes sure that new electric vehicles are available to Canadians. They are cheaper to operate; they are cheaper on upkeep, and Canadians want to be able to have access."
Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the issues is that there is no statutory requirement on prevention methods that may stop us from getting to that disastrous situation in the first place?
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out to the Minister of Environment that people in Quebec have already started saying that forcing people to buy an EV by 2035 is a non‑starter. The problem for us is that this is a matter of freedom of choice, not a need for control. What we are seeing right now is a Liberal government that wants to control what Canadians do. Many Canadians cannot afford to buy an EV, or they find that an EV is not suitable for their lifestyle. Take the example of someone who lives in northern Quebec and hunts, fishes and works in the bush. It is impossible for this person to do all that with an EV. Forcing EVs on Canadians is not a solution."
"I recall, a few years ago, supporting a woman in a hostel who was traumatised by her own decision to abort a child. Does my hon. Friend agree, in the context of this language about protecting people, that we also need to protect people from these decisions when they are not made with the proper safeguards and protections in place?"
"Mr. Chair, it is $0.7 billion over last year. What will the public debt charges be in fiscal year 2029-30 as outlined in the PBO report? What is that amount, please?"
"Mr. Chair, how long does it take to approve a mine in Canada today?"
"Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that the leader of the Green Party has been very consistent over the years. The concern I have, which was really emphasized in the last federal election, is that we need to be able to build a strong, healthy economy, and that means looking at national projects. If it was up to the leader of the Green Party, the studies that would be done would ultimately be endless. We would not even be able to pass legislation. Does the member see any sense of passing legislation of this nature given the concerns that she raises?"
"My hon. Friend is absolutely right. As I said earlier, the lack of investment in many of our northern towns and cities has really held those communities back. I am well aware of the challenges in Rossendale and Darwen and how much his constituency could flourish if it had better rail and road connectivity, and I look forward to working with him on that."
"Mr. Speaker, the hon. colleague got up once again to speak. I would be frustrated if I were one of the new members on that side of the House; they do not get up to speak, but the member gets up all the time. Our hon. colleague and the one before him, the member for Kingston and the Islands , spoke of the light bulb industry and how Canada moved to LED bulbs. The EV mandate facts are that by 2026, 20% of new vehicles sold must be zero-emission, rising to 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. If dealerships do not meet their quotas, then they are punished. I want to know whether the lighting industry also faced penalties if it did not make quotas for selling the new light bulbs that the members mentioned."
"Resuming debate, the hon. member for Jonquière."
"Madam Speaker, it is always an honour for me to rise in the House to represent the people of Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, who entrusted me with a fourth term on April 28. As is always the case in the Saguenay region, the election campaign was difficult, first because there was a bit of a Liberal wave and, second, because it is a fertile riding for the Bloc Québécois. It was a struggle every day. Once again, I would like to thank the people who put their trust in me. I would also like to thank my team, which worked very hard during the election campaign. They supported me and gave me so much motivation to power through when the going was rough. During an election campaign, we work every day. We go door to door and talk with citizens. I really want to thank my team, because it would be very difficult to do this all by ourselves. We always need people around us, and we will certainly work hard for our riding on the challenges that will arise. Today, I am going to speak frankly because the time for rhetoric is over. The Saguenay region deserves results, not empty promises. It deserves concrete projects, not bureaucratic gridlock. It deserves a real recovery, not token half measures. During the last election campaign, the Prime Minister promised repeatedly that there would be free trade across Canada by July 1. That would require interprovincial trade barriers to be eliminated, but that has not yet been done. We will wait. Those are certainly fine words, but we will see if the Prime Minister puts them into practice. He promised to kick-start the Canadian economy with billions of dollars in strategic investments to stimulate regional development, create jobs and give hope back to communities like ours, because it has been a long time since any major projects came our way. Every time projects are mentioned, we do not see them come to fruition. Today, we are talking about a hastily tabled bill that purports to fix the problem. In reality, it is only a tiny step in the right direction, and not many details are provided. Once again, we see that this government lacks transparency. As always, it gives itself some leeway to tell people that projects will go ahead when in fact they will not. Nevertheless, the bill represents an important acknowledgement. It basically admits that the Liberals themselves blocked everything with their laws, which created major obstacles to development and prevented foreign investors from coming here. The government seems to be finally realizing what we in the Saguenay region have known for a long time, namely that projects that could stimulate our economy are being stifled, not by a lack of local will, but by Ottawa's complex, poorly designed rules. This bill provides for the creation of exceptions, rather than dealing with the real problem of over-regulation. We are not going to get anywhere with a hypothetical proposal. First and foremost, the Saguenay region needs consistency and a real building plan. Let us take a very concrete example that everyone is familiar with. We talked about the GNL Québec project many times and raised it again recently. This project could have injected $14 billion into our economy, created thousands of jobs and made the Saguenay region a world leader in clean energy exports. A number of elected officials and business owners have stressed that the rejection of GNL Québec left a void in our local economy. What blocked the GNL Québec project? It was blocked by anti-development bills and regulations that impose such cumbersome and inconsistent assessment processes that they discourage any major investment. The people of Saguenay did not reject the project. It was buried by Ottawa, by a highly ideological government that drives away major investments, a government that often stands in the way of entrepreneurs, a government that does not stand up for its industries and workers, a government that must itself buy a major project like Trans Mountain to ensure it will be completed. Canada needs consistency. The government developed a critical minerals policy that omitted phosphate and high-purity iron. It then listed a number of identified minerals that are not consistent with its own policy. There is also the Climate Institute of Canada, which said last week that domestic production will drop by 56.5% if Canada does not increase its investments in critical mineral development. That is quite something. That is why I want to make it clear today that the best way to speed up nation-building projects is to repeal the well-known Liberal anti-development laws, such Bill C-69 and Bill C-48 . That is what needs to be done to spur investment in Canada and to get homegrown projects like Ariane Phosphate, First Phosphate and Strategic Resources off the ground. Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean is positioned as a region with a promising future and everything that it needs to prosper. It has a skilled workforce, a strong industrial culture, and access to global markets through the port of Grande-Anse, which leads to the St. Lawrence River and ultimately Europe. It has expertise in aluminum processing, with four clean energy aluminum smelters. We are ready. It is not the region that is lagging behind; but instead— My cell phone alarm just went off, and I apologize to the House."
"Mr. Speaker, Bill C-5 violates constitutional obligations, eradicates environmental protections, compromises workers' health and safety, and fails to hold corporations accountable in cases where violence is inflicted on indigenous women and girls, which is one of the calls for justice from the national inquiry. We thought Pierre Poilievre lost his seat, but it seems like he is leading the Liberal Party. Is that why the government is trying to fast-track Bill C-5 ?"
"I know that the Minister sincerely cares about all of this, and I am sure that he really wants to do his best, however the key point being made by my hon. and right hon. and gallant Friends is that, if the criteria do not cater for a situation in which senior British military personnel give first-person testimony  that somebody saved British lives by taking exceptionally courageous steps in our support, the criteria need to be adjusted. That is what should be done, as I hope he is going tell us that it may have been adjusted for the Triples."
"I rise today to recognize the St. Marys Area School District for launching a new agriculture education curriculum, an investment in both their students and the future of our Nation's food system. Agricultural education is not just for those in rural areas. It is foundational to the future of our economy, environment, and our national security. Programs like this one help students understand where their food comes from, how it is produced, and the science and technology driving modern agriculture. Beginning next school year, St. Marys will offer ag curriculum starting in seventh grade and extending through high school. Already nearly 100 students have signed up, proof that our young people are eager to learn more about the science, innovation, and business behind agriculture.  As chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I applaud this effort. It is exactly the kind of hands-on, forward-thinking program we need to develop the next generation of farmers, scientists, and entrepreneurs. Agriculture puts food on our tables, clothes on our backs, and fuel in our vehicles. Programs like this ensure it continues to do so for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, I commend the leadership, educators, and students of St. Marys for their vision, and I look forward to seeing the impact of this outstanding program."
"I am grateful to the hon. Member, particularly for setting out the case of his constituent, who was here in Westminster yesterday; indeed, I also met her. Does he accept that it is those of us elected in this Chamber who make decisions, and that assurances from officials that cannot be articulated in this House--I am looking for that articulation--are not a good reason not to back my amendment?"
"Mr. Speaker, will the minister commit to a clear plan that includes direct engagement with China, concrete steps to open new markets and immediate support for affected producers?"
"The Minister is much respected in this House. He has been at pains to emphasise that these sanctions are being placed on the people, not the Government, yet already media headlines out there are creating the image that Israel is being sanctioned. Will he underline and state the unwavering support that Israel has from him and this Government in its battle for survival against continued Hamas terrorism so that there can be no doubt that this nation remains standing with Israel?"
"Mr. Speaker, the housing minister is part of the problem. He said that housing prices do not need to come down, and now we know why: He has a $10-million real estate portfolio, including three, not one or two but three luxury properties. Housing costs have doubled under the Liberals, putting home ownership out of reach for more and more Canadians. How can the minister sit in his Vancouver penthouse and tell young Canadians who are priced out of the market that prices do not need to come down?"
It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the details of any talks--
"The figures were, of course, coming down, but the incidence of fraud--much of it online--is now back up to a new high. Many factors are involved, but will the Government look at taking further steps, including requiring enhanced intelligence sharing between platforms and banks, and better mandatory user identification on sites such as dating apps and online marketplaces?"
"My constituents in Gosport will be keen for the Secretary of State to clarify two points. First, the line on page 105 about reconsidering ""training estate needs"" will concern many, so will he confirm that the outstanding training establishments at HMS Sultan and HMS Collingwood, which employ so many, will not be under threat? Secondly, when will the promised funds for accommodation come through? The previous Government spent PS400 million on upgrading accommodation, which was beginning to filter through, but some 69 service family accommodation units in Gosport are now empty because they are deemed not fit for human habitation, and that is getting worse under his watch."
"Earlier this year I spoke at a huge demonstration outside the proposed embassy site, which was attended by thousands of British Hongkongers who fear that the hands that throttled their freedoms in Hong Kong are reaching into our society, too. I understand the Minister's point and the limitations on what he can say on the issue at this time, but this is not just a matter of national security; does he understand that it is also a matter of personal security for many of our constituents, given the increase in transnational repression emanating from Beijing?"
"due to family matters, I was unable to vote today on H. Res. 499. Had I been present, I would have voted NO on Roll Call No. 164 and NO on Roll Call No. 165.  personal explanation"
Yes. That sounds really good.
"Mr. Chair, when will the minister collect the remaining amount of the $20 billion?"
"Mr. Chair, when those targets are set, the IRCC has to consult all provinces, territories, stakeholders and communities."
"Mr. Chair, I am proud of the work the Vancouver affordable housing agency did in catalyzing thousands of units across the city. That is why I am focused now, here in the federal government, on delivering on behalf of all of Canada."
The hon. member for Calgary Centre.
"The Chief Secretary will know that the benefits of the Cullompton and Wellington stations project would bring tens of thousands of people to the city, the metro region and the Cardiff-Bristol-Exeter corridor. Thanks to a cost-benefit ratio of almost 4:1, will he acknowledge the strength of the case for that project, as set out in the letter he received from his hon. Friends the Members for Weston-super-Mare (Dan Aldridge), for North Somerset (Sadik Al-Hassan) and for Exeter (Steve Race) and from me and my hon. Friend the Member for Honiton and Sidmouth (Richard Foord)?"
"Mr. Speaker, speaking of global treaties, do you support a global maritime carbon tax on everything that we import to this country?"
"Among households as a whole, there will be more net gainers than net losers from the package. The reason for that is the increase to the standard allowance of universal credit, which according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies is the biggest increase to the headline rate of benefit since at least 1980. We are consulting on support for those who will lose carer's allowance because of the changes and considering what additional help they may need, including for health and care needs. The hon. Member will have seen in the Bill we have published that we have committed to a 13-week run-on of benefit after an assessment decision so that people have time to adjust to the new situation."
"I am not going to take any lectures on compassion. I have fought my whole life to tackle poverty and drive up opportunity for people, no matter where they are born, what their parents did, their gender, their sexuality or the colour of their skin. The social security system has many different rules for new and previous claimants. I do not believe that is an unfair system; I believe it is the way in which we protect people who have come to rely on a benefit. I am proud of the changes we have announced today--I think they are  positive and get us to a good place. Listening is a sign of strength, and I am absolutely determined to continue to listen."
"As well as the welcome developments that my hon. Friend alludes to in the Tees, this is about the wider north-east. In my constituency, Wastefront has a PS100 million investment and is creating 100 good jobs on the River Wear. Does he agree that jobs are being made in the wider north-east through this Government's policy and that they are under threat from the policies of Opposition parties that he mentioned?"
"I am grateful to my hon. Friend for setting out those policing numbers. Does he share my concern about the additional police officers we are getting? When I look at our figures for the west midlands, the boost is coming from deployments. I worry about where they are actually coming from and just how much of an increase we are really going to see."
"We who knock on doors week in, week out, know all too well the trend that has grown in recent years; every display of incompetence, every proof of national decline, and every sign of political self-interest from the Conservatives has damaged--indeed, hollowed out--public trust in the ability of our democracy to get things done. The public have had their fill, and in few other policy areas, and with no other political party, have they seen such incompetence, such decline, and such self-interest as with the criminal justice system and the Conservatives. It was the Conservatives who melted our criminal justice system, and the Conservatives who lost control of the security of our communities. It was the Conservatives who clung to hopeless policies. Indeed, it is not an exaggeration to say that in crashing the criminal justice system, the Conservatives did more harm to our country's faith in democracy, and the ability of the state to get things done, than we can ever know or quantify. I do not exaggerate that, because when I knock on doors I hear that when people ring the police, they cannot get them to attend. When they submit crime reports, they do not hear back, and they feel that there is an absence  of visible policing on their streets. That is the inheritance that the Conservatives gave the Labour Government. There is a hopelessness in our politics, and we need to reckon with that reality. Our courts are clogged, victims are waiting years for justice, police officers are stretched to the limit, legal aid is hollowed out, and communities feel unsafe and unheard. Shoplifting, antisocial behaviour, and the illegal use of e-scooters and e-bikes are examples that people in our communities raise of local decline, and they say that there are too few police to respond to those issues. This is not just a matter of law and order; it is a matter of fairness, decency and safety. This Labour Government have a challenge: to put right a criminal justice system that was fundamentally broken--[Interruption.] When I see that Opposition Members are here in such few numbers, and are laughing at what I say, it is really disheartening."
I would remind the hon. member that he must address his questions through the Chair. The hon. member for Calgary Skyview.
"It is very helpful that in the last few minutes the Leader of the House has confirmed that the media were briefed directly, before the House, on the content of the review. I am grateful to her for being so honest, but I do not think that it is enough for her to promise not to do it again. Will she order an inquiry in Government about how the decision came to be made and who authorised the briefing of journalists? Whoever it was needs to apologise directly."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the chairman of our committee knows I have great respect for him, but the bottom line is that this bill does not consider individual circumstances. It is not just people that are selling drugs. Look, I totally agree that if someone is selling fentanyl, it is a totally different situation from someone who is arrested for possessing it. The fact of the matter is this bill covers both those who possess it, using it for themselves, and those who are selling it--maybe those who have a huge ring of selling it. My point is that when there are mandatory minimums, all those people come under the same rubric. The legislation, because it now makes permanent fentanyl on the schedule I, the mandatory minimums apply, and the harsh penalties do not consider individual circumstances. I don't want to keep repeating, but I will, about how the legislation has no resources for prevention or treatment and just simply locks people up. The point is that there are going to be families and communities, because of the minimum mandatory sentencing and the inability of the judge to look at the individual circumstances, that we are going to repeat the same mistakes that were made for many years responding to other drugs. Right now we know that people of color have been disproportionately incarcerated and sentenced to mandatory minimum sentences. The trend of racial disparity also can be seen in prosecutions for offenses involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogues. The Sentencing Commission data from fiscal years 2021 to 2023 provides strong evidence that these prosecutions disproportionately target people of color. I would like to get beyond the point here when we debate these bills of saying that mandatory sentencing is a good thing, regardless of whether they are charged with possession or selling or how much they are selling, but that is not what this bill does. They get locked up. There are no individual circumstances considered. We know the consequences of that for people in many cases who, in my opinion, if I was the judge, would not impose these harsh mandatory penalties. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
[ Chair read text of Motion No. 1 to House ]
"Mr. Chair, as I said before, indigenous consultation is at the centre of the one Canadian economy bill. We are committed to indigenous consultation and to working on economic reconciliation with all first nations."
"Mr. Speaker, it is a new Parliament, but we are dealing with the same old Liberal scandals. The Auditor General has released a report against the Liberal government on the multi-million dollar ArriveCAN debacle. The Liberals gave $64 million to GC Strategies, a two-person IT firm that did no actual work and is currently under RCMP investigation. Today, this House is considering our Conservative motion to get Canadians their money back within 100 days. Will the Liberals vote to give back this $64 million to Canadians, yes or no?"
"I rise today to congratulate my dear friend, Jim Duncan, on his well-earned retirement as president of the Billings Clinic Foundation. For three decades, Jim served the great folks of the Treasure State, advocating tirelessly for rural healthcare access and the expansion of community wellness programs. Jim grew the foundation's endowments from $3 million to an astounding $150 million, funds that will benefit the community for generations to come. Jim also played a key role in introducing innovation and excellence in Montana health services, helping to bring new cancer, cardiac, pediatric, psychiatric, and trauma care to eastern Montana. Jim's advocacy will be missed, but I know the foundation will be left ingood hands with Nichole Mehling at the helm. Jim led with integrity, vision, and compassion. I wish him and his wife, Heidi, a well-deserved, adventure-filled retirement."
"We have announced plans to reform business rates, launched high street rental auction powers for councils that will help businesses to access currently vacant properties, worked with industry to open over 150 banking hubs, and introduced the Crime and Policing Bill to provide retailers with greater protections from assault and shoplifting. Our forthcoming small and medium-sized enterprise strategy will set out our further plans to help businesses on the high street and beyond."
"I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentlewoman, how many more speakers she has on her side?"
"I think I can say a few things in 2 minutes, believe it or not, about some of the comments my colleague, Representative Baumgartner, said about the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and its positive impact on rural America, the heartbeat of this country.  The food, fuel, and fiber capital of the world, west Texas, I can tell you, appreciates what is in this big and beautiful bill. It is more than just stopping a 22 percent increase in taxes for hardworking Americans who suffered an inflation tax of about 20 percent over the last 4 years. It is beyond sustainable. We could go through the list of the largest spending cuts of wasteful, woke, and fraud in this Federal Government. That is two times the deepest cut to wasteful spending in the history of our country. We can talk about energy dominance, the most significant commitment to opening up energy resources in this country to bring down the cost of energy prices for our families and to make American energy dominant again. We are so blessed by our natural resources. I will talk about the farm bill reforms. Republicans are strengthening the safety net, the risk management tools to stabilize the ag economy with respect to the volatile prices, the volatility in weather and the investment in trade promotion to open up new markets and opportunities for ag products made here and grown here in the USA. We have provisions in there that strengthen rural hospitals so they canprovide basic care to the hardworking farmers and ranchers and energy producers and their families. We have welfare reforms that stop trapping people in dependence on the Federal Government and encourage them to get out and work and do something with their hands and be blessed by it and to restore the dignity of work. Mr. Speaker, I know my time is up. God bless rural America, and God bless west Texas."
"I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham Erdington (Paulette Hamilton) for her excellent speech and for securing the debate. I am quite excited about Saturday week, not just because it will be my birthday on 5 July--[Hon. Members: ""Hear, hear.""] Thank you so much--but because the national health service will be 77. Yes, it has survived that long. [Interruption.] I have survived slightly less long, I would like the House to think. Despite the years of cuts and chaos which have left the NHS broken, it is not beaten and we are rebuilding it. There is a huge amount to do, but we are making progress. After record funding in our first Budget, I am delighted that the spending review has put the health of our nation first. And, as touched on by colleagues, I am equally delighted that the Government are determined to reform how the NHS works to get a bigger bang for our buck and better outcomes for patients, because we need that. We know we have masses to do. My hon. Friend set out many of the splendid things we have done so far, including getting waiting lists down to their lowest for two years, which is quite an achievement after only 11 months of this Government. On a more personal level, I am delighted that my constituency is benefiting directly from having a Labour Government. Charing Cross hospital has been given millions of pounds extra to upgrade vital infrastructure, including new MRI scanners,  modernised operating theatres, better energy security and a big refurbishment of the ground and first floors, all under this Government. I also hugely welcome the new investment in GPs in my patch: the Cassidy medical centre, Ashville surgery, Palace surgery in Fulham and the Chelsea practice have all been earmarked for new funding under the Government to improve facilities and help provide better care. Finally, I am excited by the possibilities of the new neighbourhood health service, which we are looking forward to in the 10-year health plan. Locally, I look forward to playing my full part in bringing together all the local health and social care practitioners, so that my residents get the better healthcare they have been waiting so long for and deserve. While I do that, I will also be working to ensure that we confront health inequalities and end the situation that we have now where people get less good access to health, less good treatment and less good outcomes simply because of their colour, what they earn or their disabilities. We must end that. The spending review continues the work we have begun of repairing a health system that has been left bruised and battered, down but not out. Combined with the 10-year plan, we will be putting the nation's health on a better path for the future and creating the change that people so vigorously voted for."
"Mr. Speaker, we are building the strongest economy in the G7. I am not sure where the member opposite has been. We are cutting taxes for 22 million Canadians. We are permanently cutting the consumer carbon tax. We are cutting taxes for first-time homebuyers. The Conservatives, sadly, are still stuck in the past. It is time to get on board or get out of the way."
"Mr. Chair, one of the minister's aides just handed him a piece of paper. I am hoping it has the answer. How many people worked for the federal government in 2015 when the Liberals took office?"
"Residents of Thornton-Cleveleys in my constituency are being warned not to eat food grown in their own gardens because a local site is being investigated after testing found high concentrations around it of a banned substance called perfluorooctanoic acid, which has proven to be carcinogenic, and there have been discharges into the protected River Wyre. This is affecting hundreds of residents in the area, and there are fears of contamination to water and locally grown food. What steps will the Minister take to address this problem under the current regulations to ensure that constituents like mine are protected?"
"I am sure that we can make representations to that Department to ensure that there is no unnecessary delay in applications for export being granted, where that is appropriate."
"Mr. Chair, again, we are here to focus on budget estimates for the Department of Housing and Infrastructure."
"Mr. Speaker, I think you have to give some consideration to all the things that happen in the House. We are still reeling from the comments from the other side, so we are just getting our thoughts together. I hope you will entertain me while we get a little point of order and get some things happening again in the House. I really appreciate your entertaining my interjection here."
"Any incoming Government would have to repeal the legacy Act. It is unlawful legislation--it has been rejected by domestic courts, and rejected by communities across Northern Ireland, and it is simply wrong for anyone to suggest otherwise. We owe it to those affected by the troubles, whom the right hon. Gentleman speaks about, including our armed forces communities and veterans, to be honest about the unworkability of that legacy Act and to get this legislation right. That is exactly what the Northern Ireland Secretary and I are working together to ensure we can do, taking full account of all the interested parties, in particular those veterans and armed forces communities that the right hon. Gentleman speaks about."
"As the father of an 18-week-old daughter, I am absolutely horrified by those proposals and I know that they will be causing anxiety for families across Lanarkshire. That is why it is so disappointing to see the SNP candidate in the Hamilton by-election back the plans to downgrade the Wishaw neonatal unit. The way to send a message to the SNP that that is unacceptable is to vote for Davy Russell tomorrow in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election."
"Order, please. The member for Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan has the floor."
"Mr. Chair, what is consensus?"
"We have said that we will use existing powers to create clean-up squads, which will force the waste criminals to clear up their mess. It is a little rich of the Conservative party, after 14 years of failure, to attack us after just 10 months in government. We have said that we are changing the carriers, brokers and dealers regime to tighten up arrangements relating to who can carry and transport waste, because the Conservatives left us a paper-based system that is open to fraud."
I declare the amendment lost. The next question is on the following motion. Shall I dispense?
"Mr. Chair, is the minister aware that Abbotsford was impacted by floods in 2021, one of the most costly disasters in the history of Canada? Is the minister aware that in the fall economic statement of the previous Parliament, over $5 billion was allocated to disaster recovery efforts in the province of British Columbia?"
"I rise today in solemn tribute to Frederick W. Smith, the founder of FedEx and a visionary business and civic leader who revolutionized global commerce. Mr. Smith passed away on Saturday at the age of 80. Mr. Smith took an idea for express package delivery that he wrote about in a 1965 college term paper and turned it into a multinational corporation worth billions, employing more than 500,000 people at 2,000 locations worldwide. Mr. Smith's father, James Frederick Smith, the founder of the Toddle House restaurant chain and the Dixie Greyhound bus line, died when he was 4 and he and his brother, Richard, were raised by their mother. Mr. Smith attended Yale University, where he was a fraternity brother of future president George W. Bush. He later served as a Marine officer and platoon leader in Vietnam, where he received the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts. Mr. Smith founded Federal Express in 1971 in Little Rock, Arkansas, and moved it to his hometown of Memphis in 1973, where it grew exponentially through acquisitions. A visionary leader who never forgot his roots, Mr. Smith became a dedicated civic booster, helping bring the NBA's Grizzlies to Memphis where they play at the FedEx Forum and supporting the FedEx-St. Jude Championship charity golf tournament since 2009. Mr. Smith was a relentlessly loyal supporter of the University of Memphis, from the FedEx Institute of Technology to the athletic programs and his personal commitment to refurbishing Liberty Stadium, the home of the football Tigers. He was also a strong supporter of the Memphis Zoo, bringing pandas from China aboard a FedEx plane, and supporting the Teton Trek exhibit which displays nature photography taken by his late daughter, Woodland Smith Rice, who passed in 2005. Mr. Smith was a legendary business leader who often testified before Congress as a representative of the Business Roundtable. I extend my profound condolences to Mr. Smith's wife, Diane Davis Smith, and nine children: Laurie, Stacey, Richard, Kathleen, Molly, Arthur, Rachel, Samantha and Buchanan; his brother, Richard Gary Smith; and granchildren, great grandchildren, nieces, nephews, and his first wife, Linda Grisham, as well as friends and the extended FedEx community around the world. His drive, intellect, wise counseland integrity made him one of the greatest businessmen of his generation. He led a remarkable life, and he will be greatly missed."
"In Armed Forces Week, will the Deputy Prime Minister join me in paying tribute to my former colleagues at RAF Brize Norton? I know she will share my horror that some on the Opposition Benches responded to the appalling attack on that base not by recognising the consequences of 14 years of Conservative under-investment in our defence, but by personally smearing one of our brave members of the Royal Air Force. Does she agree with me and my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for North East Derbyshire (Louise Jones) that this Labour Government will always support our armed forces, and that those shameful comments by the deputy leader of Reform, the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Richard Tice), bring disgrace upon him and his party?"
"Mr. Chair, by passing the one Canadian economy act, we will build projects of major significance. We will support industries like the forest products industry. We will help them retool. We will provide them the liquidity support they need to deal with these unjustified tariffs. Since 2017, over $10 billion of duties have been collected against the forest products industry, an unjust and inappropriate duty that is inconsistent with the current free trade agreement. We will continue to support the forest products industry and help it through this unjust and unfair trade war."
"Mr. Chair, I have had the privilege of speaking with many different proponents, such as first nations interested in oil and gas, and in the industry. They are supportive of the one Canadian economy act. They think it is how we will get the country going again. I really hope the members will join them in supporting the bill."
"Mr. Speaker, I extend my congratulations to the hon. member opposite on her maiden speech. She spoke a lot about the Liberal government's plans, dreams and aspirations for housing, but missing from a lot of this was a frank discussion about its record. Under the last 10 years of the Liberals, home prices have doubled. The housing accelerator fund the member touts gave out hundreds of millions of dollars to municipalities that ended up hiking home taxes for people trying to build homes, making them further and further out of reach. All we have received from the government is a vague pledge for Brookfield bungalows, but very little that is going to make homes more affordable long-term. Will the member denounce the last 10 years of the Liberal housing record?"
"Mr. Chair, I know there has been a 71% reduction in visitors who have—"
"Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present a petition signed by the health-conscious residents of my riding of Algonquin—Renfrew—Pembroke. The petitioners are calling out this government's hypocrisy after it recently and covertly signed on to the WHO's so-called Pandemic Agreement, just prior to the opening of the 45th Parliament. The Prime Minister had repeatedly promised on the campaign trail to defend Canada's sovereignty in the face of foreign threats, yet after the election, he went ahead and signed on to this legally binding treaty that will give unaccountable, unelected UN bureaucrats the power to override laws passed by our Parliament, which was duly elected by Canadians. This treaty was never debated, nor was it voted upon in this chamber. The freedom-loving petitioners are calling for the government to immediately withdraw from the WHO's so-called Pandemic Agreement."
I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington.
"Mr. Speaker, I would first congratulate the member for Huron—Bruce on his re-election. I love to hear Conservatives talk about how we get to yes, including recycling not just of electric vehicles but, hopefully, of all vehicles. I want to recognize that new hybrid models would still be available for sale after 2035, and the purchase of used gas-powered vehicles is not prohibited, so we are working towards a target. The member's concern seems to be not really with electric vehicles, but rather with the conditions. My question for the member is this: Will he support the one Canadian economy bill, which will support significant investment in clean and green energy? Would he support further investments into EV chargers to address that range anxiety?"
"Mr. Speaker, the member claims $3.9 billion has been put into this project. How many mines have been built? It is zero. I think back to my province of Saskatchewan. BHP has the largest mine that is getting built right now. The only reason that mine is going forward is that it was grandfathered in under old regulations, not under Bill C-69 . This is a failure of the Liberals. They spent billions of dollars on a critical minerals strategy, and potash is one of those minerals, but there are no other mines being proposed and/or being built right now because of the over-regulations that you guys have burdened our industry with. I would not be proud about your mining history."
"I join my hon. Friend in recognising this important Roman site in her constituency, which chariot racing took place on--how fantastic. I know that she and her constituents are proud of their rich heritage, and I am keen to see what the future holds for them."
"Mr. Speaker, the Liberals failed first responders and health care workers, for 10 years, who are calling for bail reform. For 10 years, the Liberals have put criminals' rights before victims. Violent crime has surged 50% since 2015. The Liberals' reckless drug policies have turned our hospitals and our communities into war zones. Nurses and other health care workers face horrific abuse every single shift, and first responders are assaulted and beaten while responding to calls for help. Violence is not part of their job description, and the responsibility lies squarely at the foot of the Prime Minister . He told Canadians he had a plan—"
"A third of my constituents emanate from Gujarat, so my thoughts and prayers are with the families and relatives who are obviously concerned about the plight of the 242 passengers on that flight. I understand that the plane came down in a residential area, so the people who live there will also be affected. I thank the Leader of the House for announcing the business for next week and for announcing the estimates days. Estimates day applications can be obtained from the Table Office or the Committee's website. We welcome applications. They will close tomorrow at the rise of the House, and we will be considering applications for debates at our meeting on Tuesday at 4.15 pm. Anyone applying should expect to turn up and present their case. We intend to allocate three debates each day, with a preference given to those who were unsuccessful in the supplementary estimates days. In addition to the business announced by the Leader of the House, in Westminster Hall next week, on Tuesday there will be a debate on hydrogen-powered aviation, and on Thursday there will be a Select Committee statement from the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, followed by debates on the role of careers education in improving social mobility and on Down's syndrome regression disorder. On Tuesday 24 June, there will be a debate on the right to maintain contact in care settings. On Thursday 26 June, there will be a Select Committee statement from the Joint Committee on Human Rights, followed by debates on the role of the RAF photographic reconnaissance unit during the second world war and on the funding of the BBC World Service. In recent weeks, I have raised the plight of Hindus in Bangladesh. I have also raised the atrocities in Pahalgam, but now things have come home to this country. Earlier this week, three young Indian boys were playing cricket in Headstone park. They were approached by three slightly older men. An altercation took place, and the three young boys were hospitalised, one with a fractured  eye socket. We understand that the police are dealing with this as an aggravated racial assault. It took place between young Hindu boys and older Muslim men. The police are appealing for witnesses to come forward to see who the perpetrators are, and community leaders are trying to take down the temperature so that there is no escalation. But if this type of religious hatred is going to come to this country, we desperately need the Home Secretary to make a clear statement about what the Government will do to prevent it from happening. I ask the Leader of the House to facilitate that next week."
"last month, the Senate voted to proceed to the GENIUS Act, a bill that would regulate the type of cryptocurrency called stablecoins. Stablecoins are supposed to tie the value of crypto to the value of a dollar, but in 2023 alone, stablecoins differed from the value of the dollar more than 600 times. Not only are stablecoins and cryptocurrencies volatile but the industry has a reputation for scams and fraud. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the FBI, recently reported that last year, 2024, crypto- related crime was up 66 percent, and Americans lost--now get this--$9.3 billion to crypto's scammers. Nearly 150,000 complaints were filed following crypto fraud, including more than 6,000 in my home State of Illinois. How does it work? Your mom's at home, and in comes a phone call, and the person on the phone call says: Mrs. D, I work for ``so-and-so''--usually a government Agency--and I am calling you to alert you that you missed your jury duty this month. You were supposed to show up to the courthouse to serve on a jury, and you didn't show up. Of course, your mom knows nothing about that, and says: I didn't see that I was supposed to be there. Yes. The legal notice was sent to you, and now a fine is going to be imposed on you for your failure to show up for jury duty. Oh, my. How much? Five thousand dollars. You can pay that fine, and you don't have to go to trial. Well, how am I going to pay that fine? You are going to go to the local grocery store--at the exit--to an ATM, a crypto ATM machine. How many of those do we have in the United States? We have 30,000 crypto ATM machines. You may not have noticed them in the store, but as you are checking out many times, there they sit. And what is your mom supposed to do when she goes to this grocery store, to the crypto ATM machine? She is supposed to deposit $5,000--and sometimes much, much more--into this machine so that she is buying a stablecoin, but she doesn't get the stablecoin. She directs it to the wallet of the scammer. So she is out $5,000 or more, thinking that she is paying a fine to avoid a trial and because she didn't show up for jury duty she didn't know anything about. Does that sound preposterous? It is not. It happens over and over and over again. These crypto ATM machines are the vehicles that are used for defrauding people--primarily, senior citizens--to put in thousands and thousands of dollars, and you never get any pennies back because it is all phony; it is all a scam. More than a third of all filed complaints involving crypto fraud were filed by Americans over the age of 50. Many of these scams were facilitated using these crypto ATM machines. You may be wondering what a crypto ATM is. You pass by them at the store, your place of business, and you may not have noticed them, but they are there. They are located at a local grocery store or a gas station and look like a normal ATM machine except they allow customers to deposit cash to purchase cryptocurrency, including stablecoins. They can ruin someone's life in an instant. Many times you don't hear about it because your mother, having been scammed over the phone and deposited thousands of dollars of her life savings, is too embarrassed to tell you. In fact, seven of the largest crypto ATM operators sell these stablecoins. These crypto ATMs become a favorite tool of scammers because, once a victim purchases crypto and transfers it to the criminal's digital wallet, it can be virtually impossible to trace or to retrieve. These scammers follow the same playbook. They call up an unassuming victim, pretending to be from the victim's bank, tech support, or some government Agency. They impersonate government officials. Just fair warning--and I say this because we receive a lot of calls in the office about scammers on the phone--major Agencies of the Federal Government are never going to call you on the phone--the IRS, Social Security, and such. They send written notices, and they should. So, if it is a fast-talking person on the telephone who says they are from a Federal Agency, be careful. They may tell the victim they owe money for skipping jury duty or need to pay bail to get their child or grandchild out of jail. It happened in my family--exactly that scenario. Or they may tell the victim there is fraudulent activity on their bank account or computer. It happened to me one night. My cell phone starts ringing. I answer it, and this fellow says he is from my credit union. He wanted to question a transaction, and I am thinking: I have never had my credit union call me ever. What is that all about? Well, after a while, I was dubious, and he hung up on me. The victim, however, often doesn't realize fraudulent activity is even occurring. Meanwhile, theyscramble to figure out what to do, and the scammer tells them: You can just pay the fine at the crypto machine, and here is where to go to use that service. Through it all, the scammer runs them through everything they need to know to take their life savings, thousands and thousands of dollars, and to insert it as cash into this machine--this crypto ATM machine-- sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars. They purchase cryptocurrency and send it off to the scammers' digital wallet, never to be seen again. Once that happens, the money is gone. There is no way to get it back, and there is little hope in tracing the transaction to the actual scammer. These types of scams led to nearly $247 million in losses last year, a 31-percent increase over the previous year, and the crypto ATM companies know their kiosks facilitate this fraud. I am not a big fan of vaping, but I do want to say this. There is a vaping store in my hometown of Springfield, IL, that finally despaired of all of the older people who came in in tears, shoveling money into the crypto ATM machine. The owner of the premises was given $300 a month for allowing crypto ATM machines in his business, but he couldn't take it anymore. Too many people were clearly being scammed, and he was party to it. And he had it removed. A large crypto ATM operator, Bitcoin Depot, wrote in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission exactly what I have said. They said:  Our products and services may be exploited to facilitate illegal activity, such as fraud, money laundering, gambling, tax evasion, and scams.  That is as close to a confession as you can get. The SEC filing, though revealing, doesn't give the whole picture. It doesn't tell the actual human story. Imagine a person who is retired, up in years, worried day to day whether their Social Security check is going to stretch far enough, and now loses thousands of dollars in their life savings to the scam. In Illinois, an elderly woman with MS lost $40,000, her entire life savings, to a government grant imposter scheme facilitated by a crypto ATM. Since the woman can't get around very well--listen to this--the scammer called an Uber to pick her up and drive her to the local crypto ATM--how kind to drive your victim straight to the crime. They took her personal information as well. She is devastated, since this is all the money she has been able to save in her entire life, and there is no way to recover it from the crypto ATM. Elaine, a 76-year-old woman from Florida, was a victim of crypto ATM scam after her late husband's death. She looked up the Apple support number to try to secure his Apple accounts, but, unfortunately, the number she called was an imposter. The criminal convinced her that she was the victim of identity theft and told her to immediately take $30,000 out of her bank account and deposit it into a crypto ATM. Now she is recovering not only from her financial loss but also from the loss of her husband. Many States, including Minnesota, Iowa, and North Dakota, have decided to make a move, since Congress has not. They have passed State legislation to try and crack down on those crypto ATM scams. Just a few days ago, I am happy to report, my home State of Illinois passed a similar State law. Now, it is time for Congress, because 13 States have acted, to learn something from their example. We must act so that all Americans know the risk of crypto ATMs and have proper documentation when seeking help from law enforcement to try to get their hard-earned cash back. That is why I am pushing for a vote on my amendment to the GENIUS Act, which would create commonsense guardrails to prevent crypto ATM fraud and empower law enforcement to combat these scams. My amendment would require crypto ATM operators to register with the Federal financial regulators, provide warnings to customers about scams, and create daily transaction limits so customers cannot lose their entire life savings in an instant. With my amendment, crypto ATM operators would not be able to simply turn a blind eye to the fraud that is happening at their crypto ATM machines. We must put an end to these scams. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support my amendment to stop scammers in their tracks and provide protections for people whom they represent. I want to say a word to the industry. You have 13 States now that are trying to do what we should do on a national basis. Let's establish this national Federal standard that applies in every State in the Nation to protect people from this exploitation that is clearly growing in intensity by the day. Let's protect senior citizens and many others who have been scammed using crypto ATM machines. Cryptocurrency has its detractors, and it has its champions, but I hope we can all stand together on a bipartisan basis to say that we are not going to help scammers steal money from unsuspecting people. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
"Mr. Speaker, I have already addressed that particular question, but I want to pick up on the idea of the new government, new Prime Minister and new administration. If we take a look at the reality of what is happening today in Canadian society and reflect on the political leadership in the chamber today, there is only one new leader, and that is the Prime Minister of Canada, and that is a new administration Members of the New Democrats and the Conservatives might not like that fact, but I like to think that, at the end of the day, it is a different administration. All one needs to do is look at the priorities and focus of the Prime Minister compared to those of the previous administration or Stephen Harper's administration. The New Democrats and the Conservatives might not like it, but that is the reality."
"Mr. Chair, I wonder if the member from Central Okanagan was listening to me earlier tonight. I spoke about how central transport and trucking are to our interprovincial trade barrier lifting work. I talked about the hackathon we are going to have. Maybe the member from Central Okanagan—"
"had I been present, I would have voted NAY on Roll Call No. 183, and NAY on Roll Call No. 184."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2056, the District of Columbia Federal Immigration Compliance Act. The House Oversight Committee has held multiple hearings on the failings of the Biden-Harris administration to secure our borders and protect our citizens. In March, the committee heard from sanctuary city mayors, who offered carefully crafted, lawyerly statements defending their decisions not to work with the Trump administration as it works to remove criminal aliens as quickly as possible. At the end of the day, illegal alien criminals who threaten our communities have no right to be here in the first place. State and local governments must work with the Department of Homeland Security to share information on individuals they arrest. They must also honor lawful detainers. When they do not, Congress must act. H.R. 2056 ensures that the District of Columbia cooperates with Federal immigration agencies, including ICE, to protect our citizens and nullifies prior attempts by the District to make itself a sanctuary city. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins) for his work on this important topic, and I reserve the balance of my time."
Will my hon. Friend give way?
"I agree with those words the Secretary of State for Defence said previously. I hope he was speaking to highlight problems with the Government, as those in opposition must do; I am afraid that my Government did not resolve that issue. At the end of my speech, as the Minister will know, I will pitch to him how things should be different. The bureaucracy of the scheme is astonishing. Thousands of applications remain unresolved, some of which were submitted as far back as 2021. Many of these people have had to flee and hide with their families, because they risk death--I will come back to a particular case that highlights all that. The long lack of transparency and the long delays have left these individuals in personal and collective danger. The scheme has narrow and inconsistent eligibility criteria. Individuals who have served alongside UK forces have been excluded due to narrow definitions and specific eligibility categories that rule them out. Others have been denied protection because they were employed by subcontractors rather than the Ministry of Defence, yet they carried out the same vital work and faced the same risks as others who were directly employed. Then there are the broken promises. The UK Government assured those who served with the British forces that they would not be left behind, yet lives are still at risk. First-hand reports from Afghanistan show that former allies are now being targeted by the Taliban. I did not serve in Afghanistan--I did serve in the British military, a fact of which I was proud--but there are some in this Chamber today who did serve there and who know from first-hand experience what was going on. Throughout all of this, as I lay out the individual case, there is a very simple theme: we must stand by those who stood by us, because if we do not, we are not worthy of being British or of the freedoms we uphold and fight for. Those who stood by us fought for those freedoms, too; they supported us in those fights, and we  cannot abandon them, given the threats they now face. The fact that they are in hiding, fearful for their lives, is an absolute travesty, and the idea that we could have forgotten them should be a badge of shame for any British Government and for the British establishment."
I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu).
"Mr. Chair, we are here to discuss the main estimates."
"Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the hon. member for Sault Ste. Marie—Algoma for his hard work. Of course, I too want to wish Lisa a happy anniversary. The member knows that a strong border means increased security and prosperity. The strong borders act will combat organized crime, protect the integrity of our immigration system, equip law enforcement with the tools it needs and, yes, strengthen our border. Strong borders mean safer streets. Canada's new government is cracking down on fentanyl, auto theft, guns, money laundering, irregular migration and organized crime. We will always be there to protect Canadians."
"I rise today to recognize the outstanding contributions that Mercedes Anderson-Brando has made through her volunteerism at Gulf Highlands Elementary School. Mercedes supports the school in so many ways. She is at every School Advisory Council (SAC) meeting, supports all extra-curricular events, and consistently pitches in whenever needed. The students know her and look forward to seeing her around campus. It is clear Mercedes Anderson-Brando has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility."
"I join the right hon. Member in thanking the volunteers at that help centre and all the other volunteers in all our constituencies. Voluntary work is a common theme of business questions week after week, and I am sure that the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee, the hon. Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman), will have heard that we would all like the opportunity to pay tribute to and thank all volunteers for the tremendous work they do in our constituencies."
"I beg to move, That leave be given to bring in a Bill to make provision for the general public to petition the Criminal Cases Review Commission to review sentences that the petitioners believe to be either too harsh or too lenient; to make provision about the review of such sentences; to make provision about the referral of such cases to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court; and for connected purposes. Before looking at the provisions, I ask you, Mr Speaker, to join me in a journey of the imagination to a distant, respected democracy, where there is an elected leader, an independent judiciary that is respected and a respected legal system, and where, historically, there has been confidence among the people of this democracy in that judicial and legal system. Then imagine that a bad event occurs, and the elected leader of that distant democracy effectively instructs the judiciary to impose the harshest possible sentences on potential transgressors. Imagine a scenario where someone in a fit of anger puts out a bad, offensive and inappropriate tweet for a few hours, then calms down, apologises and withdraws it, but because of that tweet is then charged and sentenced in a very serious way--potentially receiving a sentence of some 31 months, which might be significantly longer than the sentence given to a shoplifter, robber, mugger or drug dealer and the like. For people to have confidence in a legal system, sentences must be comparative. Imagine that while in prison that individual is the recipient of violent maltreatment, including being manhandled to the ground and handcuffed to the point of having significant bruises five days later. Imagine that they are then being dragged up not one, not two but three flights of stairs to the naughty girls wing, when they had been a model prisoner and had been promised to be taken to the good girls wing. Mr Speaker, you may think that that must be happening in some distant democracy and cannot be valid here, but it is with regret that I must bring you back to the reality: that scenario has occurred in the United Kingdom in the last few months. That is why I am bringing this criminal cases review Bill to the House under the ten-minute rule Bill process. It is known outside this House as Lucy's Bill. Confidence in our judicial system and the sentences that are handed out is vital. I believe that the public want to trust our system, but justice works when it is natural, fair and decent and when the public believe that sentences are appropriate. If we lose that, potentially we lose everything. We are all human, and even noble, experienced and wise judges can get things wrong, and there is a system of appeal. But the provisions of the Bill are so important because maybe the public would have ever more confidence in a vibrant democracy and our justice system if there were some kind of treble check, with safeguards over sentences, but without being able to impinge on the original judgment following a case. Let us say that 500 members of the public sign a petition to ask the Criminal Cases Review Commission to reconsider a sentence, and the commission, within eight weeks, felt that the sentence was too lenient or too harsh, it could then be referred to an appropriate court. That would give people extra trust and confidence in the fairness of our system and the comparative appropriateness of sentences. I believe that people would then feel that this is a democracy and a justice system that works for all, with the appropriate safeguards. It is for that reason that I bring the Bill to the House. I believe that it is worthy of further debate and consideration. Question put and agreed to. Ordered, That Richard Tice, Nigel Farage, Lee Anderson, Sarah Pochin and James McMurdock present the Bill. Richard Tice accordingly presented the Bill. Bill read the First time; to be read a Second time on Friday 11 July, and to be printed (Bill 275)."
"I rise to congratulate the 345 graduates of Heritage High School and their class of 2025. In their time as part of the Pride, the varsity baseball team won the regional championship. Students put on their first student-led sensory performance, ``Big Fish,'' this past spring. Students hosted Heritage's third annual First Responder Cookout, thanking them for their service. So many students have given back to our community in many ways, and they have left their mark on the community. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to watching all they accomplish, and I congratulate the graduates of Heritage High School's class of 2025.  Congratulating Independence High School Class of 2025"
"I appreciate my hon. Friend's concerns about the recruitment of engineers. Although it is, of course, primarily bus operators' responsibility to ensure that they meet their staffing needs, the Government will continue to support the bus sector to meet its current and future labour requirements. The greater long-term funding certainty that the Government are providing through the spending review confirms that the bus sector is a great one for engineers to build their careers in. It was great to meet some of the rising stars in the Go-Ahead Group just yesterday."
"Mr. Speaker, my colleague is entirely accurate in saying that IRCC does treat these cases case by case and not through blanket approval. Everything will be looked at. As to the number, I know the members across the way are trying to insinuate that hundreds of thousands of people are going to come and flood Canada. I have repeated that this is very specific legislation. In the eight-year gap between 2009 until 2015, only 20,000 people asked for such provisions. To try to frighten people or discourage them from working internationally or representing Canada or being part of the armed forces does not serve Canada, Canadians or the world, and our commitments, in any way."
"I am sure the whole House is behind the diplomatic efforts of the Prime Minister and the Government to avoid any further escalation of this conflict, and I thank my right hon. Friend for the reassurances he has given about not taking his eye off the horrors that continue to unfold in Gaza. Can he give a guarantee today that if there were to be an escalation that would drag the UK into any conflict, a vote in this House would be held first, before our armed forces were deployed?"
"Mr. Speaker, this is a new government with a new mandate. The Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience is taking a fresh look at all options to improve how we respond to natural disasters and wildfires. Nothing is off the table if it means keeping Canadians safe."
"The hon. and learned Gentleman says that he would have liked to hear more and the statement was opaque, but the other side of that coin is that it might be reassuring that the Government are not making all of our intelligence capability and understanding available to China and the outside world. He will recognise that the biggest academic partner in that research is the United States, and given the way the economy of China has grown, certainly over my two decades in Parliament, it is not surprising that it has emerged as our second largest. I want to reassure him that, of course, the agencies are able to offer full advice to universities and examine sensitivities, and we are very aware of the threats he has conveyed to the House."
"Order. I am sorry, but we are over time as it is."
"Mr. Chair, has the minister observed a bail hearing since becoming Minister of Public Safety?"
"I was not present for the vote in the House chamber today. Had I been present, I would have voted NAY on Roll Call No. 185."
"Mr. Chair, I am honoured to be here today. Canada is definitely in a housing crisis, and it has been building over decades."
"Mr. Speaker, I find that in this place, there are a lot of reasons that we get dragged into the partisanship, but at the end of the day, we are able to make friends on the other side of the aisle on like issues and policies that are able to change the country. I encourage every member to take the time to reach out on issues that are important to them and to build friendships across the aisle."
"Mr. Speaker, I am a new member of the House, and I was very impressed this morning with the vote and the support in the House for our bill. To me, it speaks about action. Action is so important, and I think, certainly, that is what Canadians are looking for. I was impressed with my colleague's comments. I have been following as well, at a distance, the matter of tolls on ferries, and I appreciate his frustration. I understand that some of the reasons behind the difficulty in resolving some of these matters is due to the fact that there are many ferry companies that are involved and there are some complexities involved. I was wondering if my colleague could comment on how he might play a role more locally, in his riding, in resolving this matter."
"The UK will purchase 12 new F-35A fighter jets and join NATO's dual capable aircraft nuclear mission in a major boost for national security. The Prime Minister has announced at the NATO summit that the UK intends to buy at least a dozen of the dual capable aircraft, which can carry both nuclear and conventional weapons. The Secretary-General of NATO, Mark Rutte, said this morning: ""The UK has declared its nuclear deterrent to NATO for many decades, and I strongly welcome today's announcement that the UK will now also join NATO's nuclear mission and procure the F-35A."" The decision will support 20,000 jobs in the United Kingdom, with 15% of the global supply chain for the jets based in Britain, supporting highly skilled jobs and opportunities for working people and delivering a defence dividend across the country. The announcement responds to two recommendations in the strategic defence review: recommendation 30, that the UK commence discussions ""on the potential benefits and feasibility of enhanced UK participation in NATO's nuclear mission"", and recommendation 46, on the mix of F-35B and F-35A. The purchase represents the biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation, and reintroduces a nuclear role for the Royal Air Force for the first time since the UK retired its sovereign air-launched nuclear weapons following the end of the cold war. The UK's commitment to NATO is unquestionable, as is the alliance's contribution to keeping the UK safe and secure, but we must all step up to protect the Euro-Atlantic area for generations to come."
"This is a debate about GP access across the United Kingdom, but one issue in Northern Ireland is GPs' ability to access indemnity insurance, whereas in England and Wales there is a Government-provided scheme. Does the hon. Member agree that if the Government worked with the Department of Health in Northern Ireland to allow our GPs to access that indemnity insurance scheme on a national level, it would ease some of the burden on our GPs?"
"Madam Speaker, that is an excellent question from my colleague, the famous chair of the government operations committee, where we have worked so hard to dig into the outrageous sums of money the government has paid to well-connected consultants. Those who are following these issues of corruption and waste closely will be interested to know, and the member can correct me if I am wrong, that next Tuesday, the Auditor General will be releasing a report specifically on government contracts to GC Strategies, one of the firms at the centre of the arrive scam scandal. Absolutely, the government is much more interested in supporting its insider consultant friends than it is in helping Canadians. This is evident in its spending, and it is evident today in the jobs numbers. I hope the government is seized with the jobs numbers and how bad they are. They need to change course as a result."
"Absolutely. I am so proud of my hon. Friend and everybody else who has contributed to the debate, whether LGBT or an ally. I stand here as an openly gay man, but allies have talked about films--""Pride"" and things--that they have seen. It is important for us all to be here and to recognise Pride, and I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention. Wearing a lanyard or putting a flag on a building is not a political statement; it is a sign of respect. Saying that you are an ally or that you just plain do not care either way, but you support people to live how they want to live, is not a political statement; it is a statement of respect. Respect is what we should be about in this country. It is a very British thing, whatever our side or our politics, and I quite like that about the country that we live in. Life is more than black and white; it is filled with wonderful colours. Above all, there is something quite powerful in saying, ""This is me and I am proud of it."" That joy pushes back against all the shame and silence that we have faced over the years, and that we still face now. As long as anyone feels the need to hide who they are, this month will be needed. Happy Pride month to people in the Chamber and people in Burnley, Padiham and Brierfield."
"If I heard the Foreign Secretary correctly, he said that the UK would act if Iran sought to block the strait of Hormuz. Did he mean ""act militarily""? In what other conditions would he consider military action, and what would he say if the Americans turned to this Government and asked them for support in any military adventure to do with this conflict?"
"Mr. Speaker, as I said in my speech, the devil is in the details of what “comparable” means. I agree that we do not want a race to the bottom, but we definitely want a removal of interprovincial trade barriers that are unreasonable and that hinder our economy."
"The  14,500 volunteer magistrates who deal with 95% of criminal cases are the backbone of our justice system. Will the Lord Chancellor meet me, the Magistrates' Association, and a group of cross-party MPs who recently wrote to her, calling for a long-service medal to be established for justices, as well as discussing the Magistrates' Association's forthcoming report on how to recruit and retain magistrates, as she increases their powers and responsibilities?"
"I declare Motion No. 18 carried. The question is on Motion No. 19. If a member participating in person wishes that the motion be carried or carried on division, or if a member of a recognized party participating in person wishes to request a recorded division, I would invite them to rise and indicate it to the Chair."
"I do agree. It is also about funding, which we must explore; but, yes, my party believes in localism--bringing things down to the local level is crucial. It needs to be stated from the off that the Bill does not go far enough. It falls short of delivering the comprehensive, transformative change that our bus network desperately needs--and thus, I urge the Minister, even at this late hour, to be even more ambitious. I will now outline the measures in the Bill that my party supports. Local government, not Whitehall, know what is best for their area. That is why my party has long championed localism, which is all about providing communities with the necessary tools to realise their potential. The Bill's provisions to improve, streamline  and extend franchising rights to all local transport authorities is consequently long overdue and supported on the Liberal Democrat Benches."
"I am under strict encouragement from Madam Deputy Speaker to be speedy, so I will not give way. I very much support the spirit of new clause 20, but I cannot support new clause 106. I acknowledge that those who tabled it want women to be able to access the best healthcare available, but it would be a step backwards to make it harder for women to access the treatment that they need, whether that is women in a coercive relationship, or those who live in a rural area with limited transport options, and who find it hard to access in-person medical appointments. Telemedicine enables timely, accessible abortion care. We rightly speak repeatedly in this House of the strain on our NHS's space, staff and capacity, so it feels entirely retrograde to roll this service back and insert clinically unnecessary barriers, and I cannot support doing so. The amendments and new clauses before us are subject to free votes, so Members can rightly choose for themselves. I very much hope that we choose to move forwards, not back."
"As I said, the Law Officers' convention prevents me from disclosing whether Lord Hermer advised on this issue or indeed any other. It does not, however, prevent me from saying that I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman wants to talk about illegal migration, given the abject mess the Conservatives left the country in."
"Yesterday's spending review saw this Government investing in national renewal. To truly deliver on that, it is vital that small towns such as those in my constituency fully feel the benefits. We need local investment strategies to  address the things that hold our areas back, such as a lack of a commuter rail link in Rossendale or overreliance on a single road in Darwen. These solutions are inevitably unique to an area, requiring investment plans that are locally led but nationally backed. Small towns like mine need to be at the heart of our national renewal, so will the Leader of the House agree to a debate in Government time on that vital subject?"
"I rise today in strong support of the HALT Fentanyl Act, critical legislation to crack down on the criminals who produce, traffic, and sell fentanyl and fentanyl- related substances. Earlier this year, we were able to hear powerful testimony from two of my constituents, Ray and Deb Cullen, who tragically lost their son, Zach, to fentanyl poisoning. Unfortunately, they are not alone in this pathway to pain. Last year, one Pennsylvanian died from an overdose every 2 hours, with the overwhelming majority of these resulting from fentanyl poisoning. We owe it to our future generations to end this plague on our society by passing the HALT Fentanyl Act. Our courageous Border Patrol and law enforcement officers will be more effective in removing fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances that come across our border, end up in our communities, and poison our children, friends, and neighbors. Additionally, this legislation will also result in harsher penalties for the criminals and cartel members who are responsible for the spread of this poison. As a nation, we can no longer sit by while future generations of American workers, parents, and community leaders are taken away from us. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation today and to save the lives of so many throughout this great country. It is time to halt fentanyl."
"I thank the Minister for his preview. As chair of the all-party parliamentary group on women affected by the criminal justice system, I welcome the independent sentencing review's final report. I note that the review encourages the Government to consider introducing statutory defences for victims of domestic abuse, including where coercion has been a factor in their offending, to prevent unnecessarily criminalising them. Will the Government look further at those proposals?"
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2351, a bill requiring the Coast Guard to have a substantive policy on treating drug overdoses onboard vessels and also ensuring that the Coast Guard has the legal authority to prosecute certain drug smuggling cases. I would also like to express my thanks for the bipartisan leadership of Chair Sam Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and Subcommittee Chair Ezell. This bill will strengthen the Coast Guard's ability to meet a core mission, saving lives. As we all know, the Coast Guard is involved in high-risk drug interdiction missions, as well as recreational boating oversight where drugs may also be present. This bill requires the Coast Guard to update its policy on carrying and utilizing medications to treat drug overdoses such as naloxone. Further, the bill ensures access to these medications at every installation and operational unit. As we all understand, handling drugs like cocaine and fentanyl is an exceptionally risky endeavor, and ensuring the Coast Guard has the necessary medication to prevent someone from losing a life is critical. In addition, this bill also provides the Coast Guard with the ability to prosecute drug smuggling cases when the vessel operator is not physically onboard. As technology continues to evolve and transnational criminal organizations get savvier and more sophisticated with their operations, this levels the playing field and helps the United States hold these unmanned vessel operators accountable. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support my colleagues who have worked on this important bipartisan legislation, and I look forward to seeing it passed into law. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"I think my colleague from Texas (Mr. Roy) explained very well why we are not voting to increase the deficit by $3 trillion. We all know that that is coming from the fact that we are extending tax cuts that were passed in 2017. By the way, if we go back and look at the Record at all the scare tactics and all the Armageddon comments that were made when we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, we heard the same things. None of those things happened. In fact, we had a booming economy. I don't think the same scare tactics are going to work again. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Every major organization that does budget analysis says that they are going to add trillions to the debt. The only people who don't are the gentlewoman from North Carolina. I am sorry. I didn't know that you do independent budget analyses, but every other one does. There is one Republican in this House who is not afraid of Mr. Trump and that is Mr. Massie. Let me read a couple of tweets that he posted. He writes: ``Why didn't Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act make tax cuts permanent? ``Because the impact of the tax cuts on debt after 2025 was understood by them to be too great. Now they're employing new math to claim that renewing the tax cuts, without cutting spending, won't impact debt.'' He writes: ``Hidden inside of a resolution we will vote on today to bring rescissions to the floor is an order to pass H. Res. 492 without a vote. H. Res. 492 changes the text of the BBB after it already passed the House. Sneaky.'' Can we at least be honest about what is happening here? Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Stansbury)."
"I agree with my hon. Friend. Moving towards animal-free research will take some time, which is why we refer to ""phasing out"". The funding structures, particularly relating to academic research, have to shift. I thank her for her intervention."
"I rise today to congratulate the 400 graduates of Broad Run High School's class of 2025. In their time as Spartans, they have worked hard in class, participated in clubs and extracurricular activities, competed in sports, and made lifelong friendships. The class of 2025 has excelled across a wide range of fields this year. The girls' varsity rowing team won bronze at the State championship. The Marching Spartans' Celestial program dazzled, and their production of ``The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' wowed crowds. They left their mark on our community in Ashburn. I look forward to seeing what they accomplish next. I congratulate the class of 2025 at Broad Run High School. I know they will look back on their time fondly. I hope they come back to Ashburn often.  Congratulating Dominion High School Class of 2025"
"The hon. member, for about 30 seconds."
"it is a privilege to rise today to recognize the life and service of Mr. Henry ``Floyd'' Wells who will celebrate his 105th birthday this month--a milestone few ever reach. I join his family, friends, and this grateful nation in celebrating not only the years he has lived, but the legacy he has built through courage, service, and unwavering patriotism. On June 9, 1944--his 24th birthday--Floyd stepped onto a beach in Normandy, France, carrying only a .45 pistol and a sawed-off shotgun. He was one of nearly 133,000 Allied troops who took part in the D-Day invasion. That historic day changed the course of World War II and, ultimately, the course of world history. But behind that massive operation were brave individuals like Floyd--young Americans from small towns like Wauchula, Florida--who answered the call to serve without hesitation. Mr. Wells' bravery, and the bravery of all who fought beside him, helped secure the freedom we enjoy today. He was part of a generation that stared down tyranny, defended liberty, and rebuilt a shattered world. And for that, we are eternally grateful. Floyd's service didn't end when the war did. He came home, built a life, raised a family, and continued to live with honor, humility, and strength. His son, Mike, speaks with great pride about the man he is, and that pride is deeply deserved. It is clear that Mr. Henry ``Floyd'' Wells represents the very best of America--commitment, sacrifice, and love of country. I am proud to represent a district that includes heroes, like him. May we never forget that freedom is never free--and that behind every American flag is the story of someone, like Floyd, who defended it. I wish a happy 105th birthday to Mr. Wells. May God bless him and his family, and may He continue to bless the United States of America."
"I thank all the Members who have made contributions to today's debate. I am particularly grateful to the hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Helen Hayes) for bringing the debate before the House, giving Members a chance to speak about their and their constituents' experiences of, and with, the Windrush generation. As noted by the then Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, in a letter to MPs, those first arrivals on the Windrush were expected to make a genuine contribution to addressing the UK's post-war labour shortages. The story of the Windrush generation that followed is both troubling and inspirational, with many accounts of exceptional resilience and the overcoming of adversity. I want to be very clear: it is important that we acknowledge when the state fails its citizens. The treatment of some Windrush citizens was an unacceptable failure that successive Governments must own. That is why the previous Conservative Government apologised unreservedly and took decisive action. It was critical that the last Government established the compensation scheme. Over PS100 million was granted in compensation to those affected, with over PS93 million having been paid out, and that figure continues to rise as more claims are settled under this Government."
"I thank the hon. Member for his comments and the tone in which he made them. It is the responsibility of all of us always to stand up to antisemitism. It is sadly a battle that is never won. The lesson of history is that it falls to every generation to fight antisemitism and fight it again, and certainly I can promise that this Government will always do that. Let me turn to the specific question about the BBC and charter renewal--with apologies to the right hon. Member for Daventry (Stuart Andrew) for not answering his question on this earlier. I have not discussed charter renewal in the context of Kneecap and the other acts broadcast from Glastonbury this weekend. We have, of course, discussed charter renewal, and it is absolutely right to say that editorial standards must be part of that discussion. When we release the terms of reference, which we are due to do shortly, everyone in this House will see a clear commitment to that as part of the ongoing conversation we will have about charter renewal. Finally, I welcome the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Max Wilkinson) saying that chants of death must not be made to anyone. Chants of death--to anyone--are not welcome in our society. There was something particularly pernicious about chanting, ""Death, death to the IDF"". Many colleagues will know that in Israel, there is a conscription model. Every young person is required to serve in the IDF, which means that chanting ""death to the IDF"" is equivalent to calling for the death of every single Israeli Jew. That is one of the many reasons why we take this so seriously and why it cannot be argued that this did not cross a very dangerous line."
Will the Minister give way?
"It is not just by giving statements to the media that this Government disrespect the House. Just before we went into recess, we had a farcical situation where the shadow Secretary of State for Education had to bring forward an urgent question asking for a written statement to be made earlier in the day. The Government very clearly decided to make a written statement later in the day, and sent a Minister to come here, not answer hon. Members for the whole urgent question and refuse to say what the content of the written statement was--a statement that the Government had already written and intended to publish later that day. That was done simply to avoid scrutiny. What representation did the Leader of the House make on that day to ensure that information was given to the House in a timely fashion so that it could be scrutinised, rather than the Government hiding away?"
"I just left the classified all-Senators briefing with the administration on Iran strikes. One thing is very, very clear: The briefing raised more questions than it answered. It is why we need to enforce the War Powers Act. I have always been clear: Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon. A few days ago, President Trump claimed that Iran's nuclear program was ``totally and completely obliterated.'' I asked what information exists to verify the President's claim, and I did not receive an answer to that question. What was clear from today's briefing is that there is no coherent strategy, no endgame, no plan. What are we doing? Anybody who sat in that meeting and is honest with themselves would recognize that we need to enforce the War Powers Act and force the administration to provide answers to some very important questions about Iran and our national security. When the administration is forced to answer questions, we will get more clarity, and maybe they will get more clarity too. So it is an important thing to do."
"My hon. Friend is right: the Bill does streamline the delivery of new homes and critical infrastructure. Although the changes I have just referred to relate not to homes but the regime for nationally  significant infrastructure projects--big clean energy projects, water reservoirs and so forth--there are other changes in the Bill that do support a more streamlined local planning process."
"the IBWC plays a crucial role in addressing water needs across the U.S.-Mexico border. I support H.R. 1948, as amended, to ensure the IBWC has the authority necessary to carry out its critical work and urge my colleagues to support this bill, as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."
"I am not entirely sure that I agree with that. However, I want to talk about the MHRA, which is just not set up to license drugs for ending life. Clinical trials to support such a licence and MHRA requirement would be impossible. However, the substances likely to be used are already tried and tested in other jurisdictions and are MHRA approved for other purposes. New clause 13 already provides us with the strict regulation that we need, without putting prohibitive hurdles along the path to a compassionate and painless death. Amendment 42 would remove the backstop date for implementation, giving the Government indefinite discretion over when or whether to put this law into effect. That cannot be right. If Parliament passes the Bill, there must be a clear and reasonable timeframe for implementation. The four-year backstop already gives Government more than enough time to get this right. Removing it simply invites delay. This is a moment to show that we can be both compassionate and competent, and that we can bring an end to the quiet suffering caused by an unjust status quo and replace it with a system that is safe, fair and accountable. Let us support new clause 13, let us reject amendments that would add red tape or stall the Bill's progress, and let us show dying people that we are  ready to treat them with the dignity and trust that  they deserve."
"I regret that I was not present to vote on Roll Call Vote No. 152. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 152. Stated against:"
"Mr. Speaker, Honda Canada was in my riding until this latest election and the redistribution. I dealt with it all the time. I thank my colleague for pointing out the importance of those jobs. I remember when Stephen Harper, back when I was a mayor prior to my time here, introduced the gas tax. For a lot of municipalities, it was dedicated funding for roads and bridges. I know how important it was, especially for the rural areas at that time. This is ridiculous. All the companies know it. All the manufacturers know it. Does the member believe this will go the same route as the carbon tax and that the Liberal government will try to sell it, but in the end, the reality is that it just makes absolutely no sense?"
"today, I rise to honor a man who has been more than just a reliable IT, or internet technology, guy. Bob has been a quiet, constant, behind-the-scenes hero, and for many of us here, a trusted partner and friend. Bob Turney is retiring today, Mr. Speaker, from the Chief Administrative Office after nearly three decades of dedicated service to this institution. Let me tell you, in this business, it is rare to find someone as steady, sharp, and, yes, selfless as Bob Turney. It is even rarer to find a tech guy who not only understands computers but understands people. Bob Turney is that guy, Mr. Speaker. I am proud he is a fellow Texan. He started in the House way back in the summer of 1996, working in the district office for a Member of Congress. He later served in the D.C. offices of two different Members before making the leap into IT in the year 2008. That is when Bob officially became the go-to guy who could fix just about anything with a keyboard, a cable, or even a calm word of advice. He is great. He has seen Congress through dial-ups, shutdowns, upgrades, and upheavals, Mr. Speaker. He kept us wired. He really had things wired. He kept us wired when the system crashed, and he kept calm when the screens turned blue. Believe me, that is no small feat when you are dealing with a bunch of Members of Congress and a great staff, Mr. Speaker, who, by the way, need help unlocking their iPhones. More than his technical skills, Bob Turney brought wisdom, humor, as well as humility. He understood the importance of servant leadership, Mr. Speaker. He never sought the spotlight. He simply showed up and did his job when it mattered the most. Bob is retiring under circumstances, Mr. Speaker, he did not choose, but he is doing so with grace and grit that reflects the very best of who he is and who we all aspire to be like. His health challenges may have forced this chapter to close, but knowing Bob, the next one will be just as meaningful. Mr. Speaker, if Bob is watching, I say thank you to my friend, my pal, and my buddy. I thank him for his blood, toil, tears, and sweat, as Churchill would say. I thank him for his service to the people's House. I thank him for being one of the good ones. Bob may be hanging up the laptop, but his legacy is logged in for good. May God bless him. Godspeed."
"Mr. Chair, in the interest of transporting more product from the production of oil fields in Alberta, Saskatchewan, B.C. and everywhere else, when will the Liberal government scrap the job-killing oil and gas production cap?"
"Mr. Speaker, I thank my Conservative colleague for her speech and for her strong convictions on this issue. We will not always agree on all the measures to be taken or on the entirety of a bill. However, it seems to me that in the case of this bill, everyone had pretty much agreed to finish with this measure, which has already been studied several times in previous versions of similar bills from the Senate and the House. Does my colleague not think that we have much more pressing issues to deal with besides bills that we already debated in the previous Parliament? Should we not instead focus on everything that is wrong with the immigration department and try to do everything we can to fix it?"
"Yes, I like to be constructive. The hon. Member for Mansfield has not been so constructive; he has used the debate to try to score political points. I am using the debate to try to get justice for the members of the BCSSS. The trustees were disappointed by the previous Conservative Government, and they are a little bit disappointed with the current Labour Government, who they feel have dragged their heals in dealing with the BCSSS. They have dealt with the mineworkers' pension scheme much quicker. We are all ex-mineworkers, and we should be treated fairly. I know the trustees have met the Minister today. I have spoken to the chief integrated funding adviser and the feedback is that it was a positive meeting, and the Minister once again appeared receptive to the requests put forward by the trustees but stopped short of saying she fully supports those requests. There is a very simple solution to all this. Just give us our money back--it is our money--and let us discuss the future surplus sharing agreements. We ex-miners should not be a cash cow for the Treasury. I could go into all the facts and figures in this debate, but it is simple. It is about giving back to the mining community what it is owed. Not only did the miners of the past help create the Labour party, but they gave their money to the cause through their union donations. It is time to pay back the miners; there should be no excuse. Let us imagine two brothers in their 70s who spent 40 years each down the pit. One is in the MPS and the other in the BCSSS. They worked side by side underground. The brother in the MPS has just had a 50% uplift in his pension thanks to this Labour Government, but the one in the BCSSS has had nothing. That cannot be right; it is not fair. I hear people in this bubble in Westminster say that young people would not go down the pit these days, but you are all wrong--every single one of you. In the coalfield communities, mining, hard graft and a sense of working-class pride are in our DNA. When the time comes for mining communities to step forward and go back underground, the descendants of our brave miners will do their duty. That time will come, mark my words. In the meantime, it is time for this place to deliver justice for the miners. I would like to hear the Minister state from that Dispatch Box that she fully supports the trustees' two main requests and that she agrees that the whole of the investment reserve fund, and not just part of it, should be shared out. There was a saying when I worked  underground and all the pits were shutting. It was: ""Have we heard owt, duck?"" That is what ex-miners are saying right now to their pit mates, so I say to the Minister, who I know has been speaking to the Treasury and the trustees: have you heard owt, duck?"
"I am proud to announce California's 29th District's winners of this year's Congressional Art Competition. In third place, from Ulysses S. Grant High School in Valley Glen, we have Daniel Graciano's ``Whispers of the Woods.'' Daniel's piece shows a lonely cabin sitting quietly by the water's edge, embraced by towering pines and deep shadows. This ink drawing captures a sense of isolation of nature, where time stands still and every tree tells a story. It is a perfect escape drawn in silence. This piece will be hanging in my district office in Arleta. In second place, from Van Nuys High School, we have Gayane Charyan's ``Forlorn Art Piece.'' In this piece, we see a girl sitting alone on a swing. The shadow of herself is her only company. This is an important piece that lets people know that loneliness and mental health affects all of us. Mr. Speaker, I also take this time to share the 988 lifeline that is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Help is available for everyone who needs it. This piece will be hanging in my Washington, D.C., office. Mr. Speaker, in first place, from PUC Lakeview Charter High School in Sylmar, we have Nevaeh Cortez' piece, ``Heavy Minded.'' This piece shows how your inner thoughts can sometimes feel heavy. However, this piece also shows how to appreciate the beauty in the things that you find joy in. This piece will proudly be on display in the Cannon tunnel for the next year. Mr. Speaker, I am proud of all the students who submitted their pieces for this year's art competition. This year's submissions told personal stories about what it means to be a high schooler in 2025. I thank all the students who submitted a piece, and I look forward to seeing where these students' talents carry them in their future endeavors."
"I rise today to recognize the outstanding contributions that Shae Burgess has made to our community as a volunteer with Pasco County Schools. Shae's has been an integral part of organizing a more robust support system for the school's athletic teams. With a passion for sports and a heart for service, Shae took on the challenge of revitalizing the athletic booster program. Under Shae's leadership, the booster program has flourished. They have organized numerous fundraising events and supported multiple school organizations. These funds have been used to purchase new equipment, upgrade facilities, and provide scholarships for student-athletes. Shae's innovative ideas and relentless drive have not only increased financial support but also boosted community involvement and school spirit. In addition to her work with the booster program, Shae volunteers directly with the sports teams. Shae is always there to lend a hand and mentor other volunteers. Shae's commitment to the school extends to the staff as well. Recognizing the hard work and dedication of teachers and administrators, Shae has initiated several programs to show appreciation for their efforts. She organizes staff appreciation events, where teachers and staff are treated to breakfast or lunch, and receive tokens of gratitude from the community. Through her actions, Shae has fostered a sense of unity and pride within the school community. Her ability to bring people together, whether it's parents, students, or staff, has created a supportive environment. Shae's impact is felt not just in the success of the athletic programs, but in the overall morale and spirit of the school. Shae Burgess is a remarkable volunteer whose dedication and hard work have made a lasting difference. Shae's story is a testament to the power of volunteerism and the profound impact one person can have when they commit to making a difference. It is clear Shae Burgess has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, andI am grateful for her service. May we all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility."
"I think that Windrush and other scandals that have plagued our society are a stain on the UK. Whether the cause was, as the hon. Member said, a few bad apples or any other reason, the fact remains that we have to take action to address the issue that was created. We must ensure that those who were affected are compensated, that those who were affected and cannot be compensated are recognised, and that measures are put in place so that it cannot happen again. That is what I am interested in. I was not here in the last Parliament--that is not an excuse, but all I can do is my very best to ensure that injustices are not repeated in future. As I was saying, the compensation scheme has paid over PS93 million, and that figure continues to rise. We hope the Government will continue to ensure that those settlements are paid. However, as we look forward to this year's Windrush Day, while we must reflect on and learn from past injustices, we should also reflect on and honour the contributions of this remarkable generation. The noble Baroness, Lady Benjamin, who chaired the Windrush Commemoration Committee, spoke in a parliamentary debate about the importance of celebrating the positive aspects of Windrush Day. While for some, that name will forever be associated with scandal, I welcome the efforts of communities and members of the Windrush generation to reclaim it in a positive light. Many campaigners want the term ""Windrush"" to represent, not the scandal, but the vast and very many contributions made to the UK by this generation. As His Majesty the King noted when meeting members of the community on the 75th anniversary of the ship's arrival, this was an ""indomitable generation"". He said: ""History is, thankfully and finally, beginning to accord a rightful place to those men and women of the Windrush generation."" A critical element of that recognition is commemoration, and--as we have heard--we should be grateful for the work of Basil Watson, whose magnificent national Windrush monument stands as a powerful tribute to the community. As the hon. Member for Vauxhall and Camberwell Green (Florence Eshalomi) reflected, its location at Waterloo means that thousands of people pass it every day, a constant reminder to those departing or arriving at the station. When the decision was made to locate that monument at Waterloo, officials said that the decision was taken because it was where thousands of Windrush pioneers first arrived in London before starting new lives across the UK. For many members of the Windrush generation, Waterloo was not the end of a journey, but the beginning of a new life in this country and of the many contributions that they would go on to make. A former Minister at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government captured the essence of the monument: ""Basil Watson's sculpture perfectly captures the spirit of Windrush. In it we see the strength, hope and expectation of those who arrived with little and yet gave so much."" Of course, that statue--while symbolic--is only one part of the broader support provided. As Members will recall, in 2020 the previous Government launched a fund to support community-led initiatives celebrating Windrush Day. That funding was intended to enable projects across England to commemorate the Windrush generation and their descendants. It formed part of a wider effort to recognise the Windrush generation's lasting contribution to British society, and I am pleased to see that the funding continues in 2025, with 30 projects supported under the current grant scheme. I understand that the Government have dedicated PS4.25 million in funding towards honouring the Windrush legacy. In addition, while the Government have a vital role to play, the 75th anniversary also saw a wide range of private contributions, from events and exhibitions to documentaries, articles and much more."
"First, I thank the Secretary of State for sending our Committee a letter on Friday evening setting out the Government's intentions for AI and copyright. Reflecting what the Chair of the Liaison Committee, the hon. Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Dame Meg Hillier), said, both the nature of the letter and the method with which it was received were almost symbolic of how this whole process has been conducted from beginning to end. It was fairly haphazard and chaotic, and it was not entirely clear what the Secretary of State or the Minister intend to happen next, but I am grateful to the Minister for his offer to have a chat to talk us through it. Specifically, the Secretary of State and the Minister set out their amendments to the Bill and a plan to set up this parliamentary working group, and we would like to know a lot more about that. I understand exactly what the Government are trying to do: they are trying to placate peers and bring the Data (Use and Access) Bill to a conclusion, as the Minister says. The problem is that they are still not engaging with the fundamental existential issue, which is the concerns expressed by people across the creative industries. The Government's amendment would expedite the economic impact assessment of the options in the AI copyright consultation. The Culture, Media and Sport Committee and the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee jointly wrote about that in February. Another amendment would expand the scope of the report to include training outside the UK and enforcement, which obviously should have happened from the start. The amendments are all welcome, but they miss the point of the creative industries' concern that their work and intellectual property are being exploited wholesale, without permission, without payment and without practical means of recourse and redress. I note that the Minister told the House on 14 May: ""I do not think that what is on the amendment paper today would deliver anything now.""--[Official Report, 14 May 2025; Vol. 417.] The Government giving themselves nine months rather than 12 to conclude what we already know--that their favoured consultation option is completely unworkable--is much less likely to deliver quickly the kind of transparency and enforcement for creators than the amendments proposed in the other place. The Secretary of State's letter also mentions that the Government intend to set up a parliamentary working group to ensure that ""Parliament has a voice directly into DSIT throughout this process"". The big fear is that this working group will simply be a channel through which the Government will report back on their own engagement with AI developers and rights holders. The Government instead need to be listening to the concerns of Parliament and industry stakeholders. Maybe then they will realise that this stakeholder engagement exercise between rights holders and AI developers has been tried before, as I said earlier, including in the last Parliament. It was scrutinised at the time by the Committee I chair, and each time things have got nowhere. Talks have collapsed because the status quo suits rogue developers acting in bad faith. They think they have nothing to lose by looting the work and value of our creators and our rights holders. If the Government press on with this working group, we will of course engage and do what we can to support, but let us call it what it is: a distraction technique to divert attention away from the fact that the Government have got themselves into a terrible pickle over this legislation. They started a consultation on AI and copyright when they already had stated a preferred outcome, and they have been cloth-eared to the legitimate concerns of the world-leading creative industries for month after month. They have been virtually dragged kicking and screaming to this position now, where they bring forward a couple of tiny amendments. They have been gaslighting Members of all parties and at both ends of this building who have attempted to draw attention to the situation. They have been somehow pitting our world-leading creative industries against AI, almost presenting them as luddites who are allergic to innovation and technology, when actually these are some of the most groundbreaking and innovative sectors out there. They are using AI every single day to produce world-beating pieces of creative content. The very nature of how the Government have conducted this legislation pits our creative industries against AI, and that is deeply unfair. It is all not good enough. This is simply a thinly veiled attempt to kick the can down the road--and if kicking the can down the road were an Olympic sport, the Minister would have to add ""sport"" to his portfolio. If he thinks that any of us are fooled by this, or that it will quieten those who want to stand up for our world-leading creative industries and against the existential threat that they face, he has another think coming."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 2481, the Romance Scam Prevention Act. As more consumers report using online dating services, it is important that they are made aware of potential harms. This bill ensures that when an online dating service bans a user for fraud, it notifies all the other users who have been in contact with that banned person on the service. This will help to reduce the number of people who fall victim to identified fraudsters looking to extort money from dating app users.  {time}  1445  Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important first step in addressing harm in the online dating space. However, there is a lot more to be done, and vulnerable consumers need a strong and independent Federal Trade Commission to prosecute fraudsters and scammers and to protect them from having their emotions exploited for financial gain. I encourage my Republican colleagues to support this legislation as well as the bipartisan FTC that ensures consumer protection measures like this one are fully and fairly enforced for all Americans. I thank Representatives Pettersen and Valadao for their leadership on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time."
Only three?
"All those opposed to the hon. member's moving the motion will please say nay. There being no dissenting voice, it is agreed. The House has heard the terms of the motion. All those opposed to the motion will please say nay. The motion is carried. (Motion agreed to)"
"Madam Speaker, an employment relationship is not employment insurance. The Liberals are abandoning our regions. We can see it. There is another example: softwood lumber. Groupe Remabec, among others, is laying off people throughout Quebec, and Arbec is doing the same in my community. Our industry has been in a trade war with the Americans, not since Donald Trump was elected, but since his first term in 2017. Our forestry industry has been getting hit with U.S. tariffs for eight years now, without liquidity and without support for creating added value through processing. How many layoffs will it take for Ottawa to do something about this?"
"I rise today to express my strong opposition to the devastating and dangerous tax-and-spending bill that Senate Republicans are trying to jam through this weekend on a party line vote, a bill that will gut essential programs like Medicaid and SNAP just to pay for even more tax breaks for billionaires. So let's be clear about what is happening here. This ``Big Beautiful Betrayal,'' it isn't about fiscal discipline. It is fiscally reckless. It isn't about responsibility or doing what is best for average Americans. It is about misguided priorities. It is about giving more to the ultrawealthy on the backs of hard-working families. This bill will take away healthcare and food assistance from people and families who need it most just so DC Republicans can pay more for tax cuts for those who need them the least. DC Republicans want to have more tax cuts for those who need them the least. Once again, Republicans in Congress are putting the interests of the ultrawealthy above the needs of hard-working families, children with disabilities, seniors, and Americans who rely on Medicaid each and every day. Earlier this year, I held a roundtable in Las Vegas with Nevada families whorely on Medicaid. For them, Medicaid is not just a talking point. They are not simply pay-fors in a budget bill. Medicaid is a lifeline. It literally keeps their children alive. I talked to people like Jessica, whose daughter Kay--well, she is 4 years old. She was born with Down syndrome and was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Jessica relies on Medicaid to help cover the cost of weekly physical, speech, and occupational therapies for Kay, all of which are responsible--well, they are helping her learn to walk, to use utensils, to write her own name. Imagine when her mother sees her write her own name. It is a proud moment. Kay also has a cardiologist, an endocrinologist to manage conditions related to her Down syndrome. Medicaid covers these doctors. It covers her insulin. It covers the insulin pump that allows Jessica to manage her daughter's diabetes around the clock, all because Kay can't communicate when her blood sugar is dangerously low or high. And Jessica said something at that roundtable I will never forget. She told me:  I can't imagine losing Medicaid . . . obviously I'm going to have [to try] to give up something, because I'm not gonna let her go without insulin and the lifesaving care she needs. And I can't [even] imagine having to think about what I'd have to cut or what I'd have to do--  What I would have to do--  in order to pay for the lifesaving care that she needs and deserves.  Kristy, another Nevada mom, was also at that roundtable. Her daughter Sadie is 13. She has been bravely battling an aggressive form of leukemia for the past 2 years. Since her diagnosis, Sadie has spent more than a year and a half in and out of the hospital undergoing treatment for her cancer--all covered, thankfully, by Medicaid.  Sadie's father--well, he passed away during the COVID pandemic, sadly, and Kristy became Sadie's sole caregiver and sole provider. Medicaid is critical, and, simply put, it is lifesaving. So why are Republicans looking to cut it? So billionaires can get another tax break? So that Republican lawmakers can hand out trillions of dollars in tax giveaways to the wealthiest 1 percent while thousands of people lose access to lifesaving care? The cuts proposed to Medicaid--well, they are going to affect veterans and Nevadans with cancer who can't work and who will be kicked off their health insurance, the insurance that they need to stay alive. It will kick the family caregiver, who takes care of both her aging parents, maybe off her own coverage. The majority of adults on Medicaid already work, and Republicans are counting on savings from these hard-working Americans losing coverage, too, because of paperwork? Paperwork is just going to be so bureaucratic, so full of redtape. The goal is to make it so hard, so damn burdensome, that nobody can do it. No one can go to work, take care of their sick loved one, be sick themselves. They are hoping they drop off, even if they technically qualify. This is where they find their savings. Aren't we supposed to cut redtape and improve the lives of our constituents? And so this is just cruel. It is a lose-lose situation. People can't work because they have a life-threatening illness, or they are working and they miss the complicated new paperwork which people are hoping that they can't do so they will drop off; and that is where they will find the savings. They will lose their health insurance, and maybe they will drop off, and they will lose their life too. All for a tax break for the wealthiest, for the billionaire Cabinet of our current President. This is just shameful. This bill would also slash SNAP, as my colleagues before me have told you some of the statistics. SNAP, the nutrition program that helps nearly one in six Nevadans put food on the table. Most of these recipients are children. When they cut this program, you tell me what our families are supposed to do. You tell me what families are supposed to do when they cut food assistance. How are they going to put food on the table? What will they say to their hungry children? Sorry, kids. You have to go hungry so billionaires can get a tax break. This just can't be right. This just can't be right. And it doesn't stop there. This bill threatens thousands of good- paying union jobs in Nevada, across our country, by letting critical tax credits for solar, for wind projects expire before those projects can even get off the ground. You know, in Nevada, we have more solar jobs per capita, more than any other State in the Nation, and we have enough solar energy to power nearly 1.3 million homes. It is a growing, terrific industry in Nevada. We need all the energy we can get at an affordable price. And this bill--this bill is going to decimate this important and growing industry, not just in my State but in States across this country. And on top of that, Republicans have added an additional new tax on wind and solar projects. It just won't kill the industry. Like I said, it is going to raise prices on hard-working families, families who are already paying too much for their energy. I thought we were supposed to be lowering prices, creating opportunities, expanding and investing in our infrastructure and in our Nation. But this bill is going to add more taxes, slash products, and raise energy prices for hard-working families. And all of this is causing companies across the country to stall or cancel projects over the uncertainty of losing access to the tax credits. This means fewer jobs, less investment, and just more families wondering, actually, how they are going to make ends meet. And we are talking about an industry that supports nearly 280,000 American workers: electricians, technicians, construction crews. I could go on and on about all the jobs that are in our solar and wind industry. And we are pulling the rug right out from under them--right out from under them--and killing thousands, hundreds of thousands, of clean energy jobs. Again, I want to remind you that all of this is for one purpose and one purpose alone: to give tax breaks to billionaires. So anyone who supports this bill is not pro-worker. They are not looking out for underdogs, for hard-working families. They are just focused on making the rich, well, richer. And I am not going to stand by and let Nevada families lose access to their healthcare, to their food assistance, to their jobs--all so billionaires can pad their pockets. And I want to remind people what Democrats--what we did--when we used the reconciliation process. We expanded health insurance subsidies; and for the first time, we gave Medicare the authority to negotiate for lower drug prices for our seniors. We invested in our clean energy future. We cut costs for families, instead of cutting lifelines. And this DC Republican bill is extreme; it is cruel; and it is not what the American people want. People want lower costs. People want economic security. Parents want their kids to have care when they are sick and a fair shot to thrive. They don't want their future sold off to billionaires. So I say to my Republican colleagues: Please don't turn your backs. Please don't turn your backs on families who need you, who need this, the most. I want you to come look at my Nevada moms and my Nevada dads in the eyes and tell them they don't matter, that their children don't matter, that the lives of their kids don't matter because they won't get the care they need. And I shudder to think of the consequences. Please, come to Nevada. Sit with these parents and tell them that they don't matter. I don't know how you could face them and gut Medicaid to give billionaires a tax cut, but that is what you are about to do. The American people deserve better. And I will fight every single step of the way to make sure that they get it. I yield the floor."
"I welcome the Casey report and the new actions outlined by the Secretary of State today. I specifically welcome the requirement for the collection of ethnicity and nationality data. The report refers to different and changing models and patterns of abuse. The Secretary of State will be aware that there have been historical allegations involving the grooming and sexual abuse of Sikh girls. Will she ensure that the requirement to collect ethnicity and nationality data extends to victims, so that we can see the evidence for any such model once and for all?"
"I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way during his speech against all the things he voted for under the last Government, but I am confused by Opposition Members. Is there no limit to the amount of taxpayers' money they would give to landowners, rather than to councils so that they can build social housing, roads and the other public facilities we need?"
"The hon. Member is right to say that there is excellent practice in Northern Ireland, and the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, which I chair, is looking at that. He may be interested in that."
"Mr. Speaker, are we going to have free trade in Canada and the $200-billion opportunity by Canada Day? No, we are not. There is a framework, but there is a lot to do. We just heard the minister 's speech, and a number of things are still going to happen in July, with a meeting of the minds and convening, which is something the Liberal government is very good at, but we are not seeing action. If we want to talk about a team Canada approach, I would remind the member for Winnipeg North that the premier of my province, Premier Ford, has been one of the premiers who have called for the scrapping of Bill C-69 , as I have indicated, which is one of the impediments to building things. It is going to stop them from building projects in Ontario as well."
What assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the UK's trade agreements programme.
"Mr. Speaker, since time immemorial, the arts have been an integral part of human life. From the Lascaux cave paintings to film, music, dance and poetry, all peoples throughout time have expressed themselves through art. It makes the world a more beautiful place, it inspires, it stirs our emotions, it brings love and meaning into our lives. When we marvel at a work of art, a symphony or a painting, we connect with the essence of who we are. Art is also the ability to empathize with the characters in a novel, to imagine oneself in another's shoes. It is a multitude of pathways to the humanity we all share, because creation is a human act. Today, that very essence is under threat. On June 9, representatives of more than 25,000 Quebec artists published a manifesto in defence of authentic creation because, every day, artificial intelligence steals work without consent or compensation. AI-generated content must be identified, and the government must protect creators and their copyright, because culture is fundamentally human."
"Am I right to say that the Minister described sustainability, particularly for green-belt developments, as a golden rule? I understand that the Planning Inspectorate is beginning to take that approach too. Could he quickly confirm that I heard that correctly?"
"Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member opposite on her win in my region, the Durham region, and I echo her kudos and the good things she had to say about Durham Regional Police Service officers, who work hard in our community and always have our back. I would say that I feel like what is missing in the bill are the items needed to have the officers' back. They have our back every day. With respect to the bail reforms and the things that are necessary that are missing from the bill, does the member have a comment on those so we can make sure people are not out on bail before the police are done writing their reports?"
The hon. member.
"The Liberal Democrats welcome yesterday's announcements from the Chancellor on investment in public infrastructure  projects. However, the general secretary of the Prospect trade union has warned that the UK lacks the skilled workers required for the new defence and nuclear projects outlined by the Chancellor. Similarly, Make UK and the Federation of Small Businesses have highlighted that a shortage of skilled workers would be a critical stumbling block for growth. As we continue to await the much-anticipated industrial strategy, why are the Government moving funding away from level 7 apprenticeships, when we know that they support social mobility? More broadly, why did they not seize the opportunity in yesterday's statement to commit to fixing the apprenticeship levy, to ensure that money is invested in skills and training?"
"Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, the bill on one Canadian economy seeks specifically to respond to the threat of U.S. tariffs and economic instability. During the election campaign, the Prime MInister was very clear. We are going to build major projects in Canada and we are going to build them the right way by respecting the environmental standards and working in partnership with indigenous peoples, the provinces and the territories. I know that my friend from the Bloc Québécois may not be happy about us working with the provinces and territories to do great things in Canada, but that is precisely what we are going to do."
"I will be brief, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am descended from the Stewarts of the lowlands of Scotland, and I am probably the hon. Gentleman's Gaelic cousin. This screening needs to be carried out in Northern Ireland as well as Scotland."
"as we recognize the anniversary of the Dobbs decision, I want to point out, from the outset, that there is no species, no animal, that kills its own. My family has been in the horse business for a good while. We raise pleasure horses. There is no mare that we have that kills its born, the new horse. We are in the cattle business. There is no cow that I have ever seen that has killed what it births. Yet, we as humans, for some reason, take that as a right that we can have. The Dobbs decision was one of the most important decisions of our lifetime. For nearly 50 years, Roe v. Wade took power away from the people and handed it to unelected judges, but Dobbs finally made it right. The Court didn't outlaw abortion, as my friends on the left tried to claim. What it did was restore the fundamental truth that States and the citizens who live in them have a right to decide how we protect life. In South Carolina, we have chosen to stand for the unborn, and I stand before you today in unwavering support of our State's rights to do just that. In 2018, Governor McMaster took a bold step. He blocked abortion clinics, like Planned Parenthood, from receiving Medicaid funding because these dollars should go toward real healthcare helping women, children, and families, not to organizations that end innocent lives. Despite what my good friends from the left claim, killing a child is not a birth control measure. When Planned Parenthood sued to undo the decision, it wasn't just about funding. It was about undermining the rights of our States, our government, and our people. That is why I led a bicameral amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to take up Medina v. Planned Parenthood. This case is about far more than Medicaid. It is about whether the States, like South Carolina, can align their healthcare policies with their values and whether the courts will respect these values. Dobbs and Medina both point to the same truth. Washington, D.C., clearly doesn't get to decide everything. The Constitution makes it clear those decisions rest squarely with the American people. I will continue to fight for States' rights and for the rights of South Carolinians to govern ourselves without Federal interference. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."
"Mr. Chair, as the Prime Minister has said, we are in the process of building Canada. We are preparing a bill that will enable us to build Canada together."
I join my hon. Friend in congratulating Johnstone Burgh football club on its historic win--the first in 57 years.
"Madam Chair, this is not very hard. The minister can easily answer. Will debt interest costs this year go up, or down, from what was projected?"
"Given that as many as 35,000 Ukrainian children are still missing and are probably being held in occupied territory or in Russia, will the Minister assure us that the Government are not only taking action to help injured soldiers in Ukraine back on to the frontline, but doing all that they can to support the reunion of Ukrainian children with their families?"
"Madam Speaker, it is a great honour, as always, to stand in this House and speak on behalf of the residents of my riding of Davenport. Before I continue, I want to say that I will be very happily sharing my time with my colleague, the member for Kingston and the Islands . I will be speaking to the opposition day motion today. I am also going to be speaking a lot about innovation and a lot of things that I think are shaping the future, not only in Canada, but for the whole world. What I am talking about is electric vehicles, also known as EVs. Before I go further, I want to acknowledge that we are gathered on the traditional, unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinabe people. The way we get around is changing fast. That change is driven by the need to cut pollution, slow down climate change, make our communities healthier, save money and build cleaner, smarter economies. Around the world, people are choosing electric vehicles more than ever before. Governments, businesses and families are all getting behind this movement. This is not just about cars; it is also about jobs, innovation, energy and fairness. This is about the kind of country and planet we want to leave behind for the next generation. Let us take a look at what is happening around the world. When it comes to EV use, Norway is leading the world. Nearly nine out of 10 new cars sold there are electric or hybrid. This did not just happen on its own; Norway made it much easier for people to make the switch, with things like tax breaks, toll-free roads and lots of charging stations. China is another huge player. In fact, it has more electric vehicles on the road than any other country in the world. The Chinese government has made major investments, helping local companies grow and making EVs more affordable. It has also built strong supply chains, especially for batteries and key materials. Other countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, are also moving quickly. In these countries, people can see the benefits of cleaner air, lower fuel costs and quieter cities. Their governments are also thinking long-term, making public transport electric and improving infrastructure so that EVs are practical for everyone. In the United States, EV adoption has grown quickly as well, especially in states like California. It is not just about how many electric vehicles are on the road; it is also about who is coming up with the best ideas, the best technology and the smartest ways to build these vehicles. Innovation matters. Germany continues to be a global leader in automotive engineering. Its companies are working on better batteries, more efficient manufacturing and high-quality electric cars that people want to drive. Japan was an early leader in hybrid technology and continues to work on alternatives like hydrogen-powered vehicles. These could play a role alongside battery EVs, especially for long-distance transport. South Korea is a powerhouse when it comes to batteries. Its companies are helping improve how fast batteries charge, as well as how long they last and how safe they are. This is a key piece of the puzzle for making electric vehicles better and more affordable. Of course, Canada is making important contributions, too. We have the natural resources the world needs, like lithium, cobalt and nickel. We also have skilled workers, strong research institutions and companies that are pushing the boundaries of clean technology. Across the country, Canadian businesses are working on things like vehicle automation, smart charging and cleaner battery production. We have also seen amazing work in indigenous communities, where clean energy and innovation go hand in hand with local leadership and sustainability. Where is EV innovation headed? Let us talk about the future, because this is just the beginning. First, we are going to see better batteries. Scientists and engineers are developing solid-state batteries that charge faster, last longer and are even safer. That means EVs will soon go further on a single charge and cost less to maintain. Second, EVs are becoming part of a smarter energy system. With vehicle-to-grid technology, EVs can actually help power homes and stabilize the electricity grid. This is a big step toward a cleaner, more resilient energy system, and it puts more control in the hands of everyday people. Third, the electric shift is not just about personal cars. Buses, delivery vans, taxis and trucks are also going electric. This means cleaner air in our cities, less noise pollution and a big win for public health, especially in areas that have suffered most from traffic and emissions. As we move forward, we need to make sure this transition is fair and inclusive. That is what we are doing, because we believe that everyone in Canada should be able to benefit from electric vehicles, not just people in big cities or with higher incomes. This means making sure there are charging stations in rural, remote and northern communities. It means working with first nations, Métis and Inuit communities so they are partners and leaders in this work, not just participants. It also means supporting the workers whose jobs are changing. That is what we are doing. From the oil patch to auto assembly lines, we are making sure people know there is a place for them in this new economy. When we invest in retraining, local manufacturing and green jobs, we are working for those Canadians. We are also thinking about the full life cycle of electric vehicles. I am talking about mining materials responsibly, recycling old batteries and making sure we are not solving one environmental problem by creating another one. Canada has a huge opportunity here. We are taking these important steps because EVs are a key part of our climate plan. We are seeing new investments in battery plants, EV manufacturing, and clean-tech hubs across the country. We are not stopping there, because we can lead the world in sustainable mining, green manufacturing and fair, accessible transportation. We can build an electric future, one that reflects our values of inclusion, fairness, innovation and care for the environment. We can work together across party lines, across regions and across industries to create a future where clean transportation helps us meet our climate goals, grow our economy and build stronger, healthier communities. This is not a distant dream; it is happening now. The world is changing and Canada is ready to lead. The transition to electric vehicles is more than a shift in technology. It is a chance to reimagine how we move, how we live and how we take care of the planet we call home. Let us seize this moment with boldness, with fairness and with determination. Let us build a cleaner, stronger Canada together."
"Mr. Speaker, it is important to know that our indigenous caucus has been working around the clock with the rest of our colleagues here at the federal level, and we are doing that in partnership with the provincial government and local leadership. We know supports have already been provided to people on the ground, and those supports will continue. I will continue to work with Minister Gull-Masty on this to ensure that people on the ground receive the supports they are asking for."
"Madam Speaker, I stand before this chamber for the first time, and I am humbled to represent the people of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford, located on beautiful Vancouver Island, from Chemainus to Langford and from Port Renfrew to Duncan, including Thetis Island and Penelakut Island. I thank them for putting their trust in me and for supporting positive change and hope for our riding. To my wife, Angel, and to our children, I say thanks for their unwavering support, love and enthusiasm as I tackle this new mission in life to represent our communities. I would also like to pass along my utmost gratitude and appreciation to my amazing campaign team and the committed volunteers who worked tirelessly to connect with as many constituents as possible. They include Janet and Fred, our senior-citizen, door-knocking dynamic duo. We all came together, working endlessly, and they put their trust in me. I thank them. I say a special thanks to the many young people who volunteered and turned out in record numbers to vote for positive change and Conservative values, many for the first time. I truly believe that the work we are all doing here is for the youth and future generations of our nation, and that is the reason I am here. Their dreams of Canada, where hard work is rewarded with a good paycheque, where families can live in a safe neighbourhood and where they can one day afford a home, are the dreams I will continue to fight for. Our riding is as diverse as our landscape, from the fast-growing city of Langford, with bustling urban life and a vibrant sports community, to the remote, rugged fishing town of Port Renfrew on the Pacific Ocean. There are farmlands, mills, small ports, logging, mountain ranges and remote communities spread across some 4,800 square kilometres. We have an active outdoor community and endless opportunities for recreation and tourism. We have numerous rivers and many fish hatcheries. It is a truly beautiful, stunning and vibrant place, where I have lived most of my adult life, and I am proud to call it home. There are seven first nations that make up almost 10% of our population. I continue to learn from them while respecting their culture and traditions. There are seniors, young families, farmers, trade workers, retirees, anglers, hunters and business leaders. As well, there is a strong veteran community and many serving military members across our riding. However, for all of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford's beauty, resources and opportunities, I am saddened to report that, as in much of Canada, our people are struggling. During my campaign, I spoke with thousands of people across our riding, and the message was clear: This is not the nation we all once knew. People are struggling to make ends meet, pay for groceries, heat their homes, pay their bills and provide for their families. I met many who are losing their homes or who are now living in shelters or on the street. This needs to change. Many people live without a doctor or basic medical care, with wait-lists of many years. Some of our communities, including Port Renfrew and Lake Cowichan, have no doctors anymore. The seniors who built this country are struggling to make ends meet while feeling unsafe to go shopping in their once-safe communities. These are all signs of a failing economy, and this needs to change. People are worried about rapidly increasing crime, disorder, open drug use, addictions, homelessness and poverty. This should not be the norm in our communities. The so-called safe supply experiment has failed. The overdose crisis continues to ravage communities, claiming thousands of lives in British Columbia alone. Families are left helpless as loved ones succumb to addiction. This is exacerbated by government policies that prioritize the distribution of dangerous drugs without providing adequate rehabilitation and support systems. These are not just statistics that we hear in the news. They are our daughters, sons, mothers, fathers and loved ones. The trauma of losing family members to addiction leaves lasting scars. The absence of effective action to address this crisis continues the cycle of dysfunction and despair. In Duncan, the crime rate is 237% above the national average, and the violent crime rate is 153% above the national average. A few months ago, I met Norm, a retired minister whose 80-year-old sister was mugged and pushed to the ground, breaking her hip. In Langford, police are finding drug labs hidden in homes and pulling over cars to find fentanyl and illegal firearms. This needs to change. Crime is not just a story in the news; it is something that now touches everyone's life, my own family included. Two years ago, my daughter watched as her boyfriend, Jonny, was murdered by a stranger in downtown Victoria. He was stabbed to death by a repeat violent offender who was let out on bail for attempted murder not three weeks earlier and had a history of no fewer than five violent charges against him. The Liberals' soft-on-crime bills have allowed dangerous criminals to remain free, which risks public safety. Violent criminals must be held to account to prevent further tragedies and restore faith in our justice system. What of our veterans, the brave men and women who once stood defending our sovereignty and freedom? These heroes now face bureaucratic hurdles that strip them of the respect and the care they deserve. Too many veterans despair, hearing from their government that “they're asking for more than we are able to give right now”. We lose them not just to old age but to the despair that follows when a nation forgets its promises. This is unacceptable and must change. Furthermore, serving members of the Canadian Armed Forces have been devastated by years of neglect. They face challenges that no military personnel should endure, from inadequate resources to outdated equipment and the inability to afford housing where they are stationed. To be a strong fighting force, they need modern equipment and solid recruitment, and we need to restore their customs and traditions. We must ensure they have the tools, training and resources required to do their job effectively. We need to incentivize municipalities and reduce red tape and bureaucracy while unleashing our home builders so that hard-working tradespeople can build homes. They are the experts. We do not need another government agency that will fail to deliver homes. We need to repeal Bill C-75 and Bill C-5 to keep repeat violent offenders behind bars so that people like Jonny could still be with us. We need to repeal Bill C-21 and protect the rights of our law-abiding, licensed hunters and sport shooters while protecting our borders and keeping illegal guns from entering Canada and illegal guns off our streets. We need real tax cuts that will stimulate our economy and relieve pressure on so many. We need to unleash our industry and natural resources to build our economy. For example, we need to take immediate steps to support B.C.'s recreational fishing industry, which is nearing collapse. A simple fix of marking all hatchery salmon would allow our recreational fishing industry to return from the brink of extinction. We have renewable resources, whether forests, fish, farming or even mining. Now is the time to use them responsibly and build wealth and rebuild our economy. We need to spend on responsible infrastructure, such as by bringing in rapid transit and an alternative route for the dangerous Malahat Highway. Rapid transit would connect our island, bring economic prosperity, improve safety and benefit the environment. Unfortunately, the throne speech was light on details. Promises of change and prosperity are not matched by actions or supported with plans. Where is the Prime Minister 's plan? Where is the Prime Minister's budget? We were all elected to represent our ridings and bring positive change. Parliament should be sitting through the summer, with committees working tirelessly to address these changes. Actions are not matching the promises. The people of Cowichan—Malahat—Langford have entrusted me with the immense responsibility of representing them in Ottawa, and I do not take this lightly. We are the government in waiting. Hope is what the House must rekindle in the heart of every Canadian. It is hope that drives parents; they work tirelessly so that their children can have a better life. We must ensure that our children inherit a Canada that embodies the values we hold dear, a Canada where hard work pays off, where families thrive and where every generation inherits a better future. While I may be new to this chamber, I am not new to working for the federal government. I served Canada for 28 years in the Royal Canadian Navy, defending our great nation's sovereignty, democracy and freedom. Through the skills, leadership and experience gained at sea during operational deployments and command positions, I will continue my mission to serve Canada, but now from this chamber. Let us rise together and restore the dignity of our seniors, respect our first nations, honour the sacrifices of our veterans, support our serving military and build a country so that our youth can once again have hope. Canada is worth it; our children are worth it, and the future we fight for begins today."
"Mr. Chair, the BC Ferries investment is not part of the ministry's estimates."
"I rise today for the 20th time to demand that the Trump administration restore funding for lifesaving food aid around the world. Now, today, I will talk about promises. Since the Trump administration paused funding for emergency food aid through USAID 5 months ago, we have heard a lot of promises. Elon Musk tweeted that emergency food aid would be restored. He even mentioned the name of a factory in my district, Edesia, that makes Plumpy'Nut, a type of emergency food aid. Secretary of State Marco Rubio multiple times has said that emergency food aid will be restored. He said it in his confirmation hearing. He said it just a few weeks ago in front of the House Foreign Affairs Committee when asked by my colleague from Rhode Island, Representative Amo. Just yesterday, the State Department told FOX News that they have a plan to restore this funding. Mr. Speaker, it has been 5 months and every day that goes by is another day that children around the world are going hungry and starving to death because this aid has been held up. I will continue to speak on this House floor every day until the administration honors its commitment to restore this aid."
"My hon. Friend is right that the Iranian regime is the world's worst sponsor of state terrorism and state threats. We have three individuals who were arrested under the National Security Act 2023 moving through our judicial system. I want to reassure those in the Jewish community in our country that we take those threats very seriously, and I and the Home Secretary will do all we can to keep them, their buildings, their institutions and their families safe."
"I had not intended to say what I am about to say, before the bit that I did intend to say, but, inspired by the Minister's comment that coming out matters, I thought I would use this very public forum to say that I am a bisexual woman. Some people know; some do not. I do not wear it like a badge any more than I would expect a heterosexual person to walk around saying, ""Hey, guess what, I'm attracted to men""--or women, depending what gender they are, or otherwise. The reason that I feel compelled to mention that publicly, before I get on to the good bit of my speech--please, somebody, intervene on me--is that I held back on showing my support for the LGBTQ+ community on my Facebook page for fear of retribution ahead of the local elections, when a certain party got into power at Derbyshire county council. Trying to appease that kind of support did not win any votes, so after that happened, I doubled down on what I believe in and who I am. I posted in support of the Day Against Transphobia, Biphobia and Homophobia, and I said, ""If you dare make a negative comment, or anything alluding to one, such as, 'What is a woman?', you will be blocked from my page, because there's falling on the right side of history and there's falling on the wrong side of history, and you are wrong."""
"Madam Chair, I am asking to know the projected deficit for 2025-26."
"I congratulate the right hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Graham Stuart) on securing this debate. This is an issue close to my heart. I used to be a school governor as well as a college governor, and I remember setting up--along with other teachers and professionals--a specific learning unit, as well as a general learning difficulty unit. Of course, having been a constituency MP for the past 15 years, this is an issue that I have dealt with many a time, and when I have been trying to assist  families, I have noticed that they feel utterly exhausted, not only by their caring responsibility, but by a system that seems to place obstacles in their way. My council, Bolton, has made real progress. Its ""Belonging in Bolton"" strategy is helping to create more local SEND places, and it was rightly praised in its most recent Ofsted and Care Quality Commission inspection. In the area covered by Salford city council, parts of which now come into my constituency--it now covers Walkden--the council has also been working really hard to improve provision for children with SEND, but of course, all these councils have limited resources. In Bolton alone, over 9,000 children have a SEND issue, an increase of 27% since 2015. One headteacher in my constituency recently told me that their school spends PS333,000 a year on teaching assistants to support children with special needs, but it receives only PS155,000 in education, health and care plan funding. That leaves a gap of PS178,000 every single year, around 7% of the school's total budget, which they have to find somewhere. That is before we factor in the costs of behaviour support, speech and language therapy, or educational psychologists. We need a proper plan that would increase the outdated PS6,000 top-up threshold; invest in local authority teams to ensure that EHC plans are issued on time, giving families the certainty they need; and target capital funding at where demand is greatest, including in Bolton South and Walkden, to make sure that children can get support closer to home. Children in Bolton South and Walkden need support, and that must not be like winning a lottery."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 910, the Taiwan Non- Discrimination Act of 2025, sponsored by Representative Kim from California and cosponsored by Representative Green of Texas. H.R. 910 requires the United States to advocate for Taiwan's membership and participation in the International Monetary Fund, also known as the IMF. Taiwan is currently seeking to join the IMF, and I believe we should support this effort. The IMF was formed in 1944 to encourage economic cooperation and stability after World War II. Today, the IMF offers technical assistance related to sustainable economic growth and an international reserve to provide liquidity, among other services it provides to its member states. It is an essential institution for security and cooperation on global economic matters. Taiwan has a big impact in the world: vibrant culture, delicious food, and a highly-educated population. Taiwan is also an essential economic and trade partner of the United States and so many other countries around the world. According to the World Trade Organization, Taiwan was the 16th largest exporter and the 21st largest merchandise importer in 2023. Those exports, especially for information and communications technology products, make Taiwan a critical partner to the United States and to our industry and workers. Thus, it seems obvious that such a pivotal part of the global economy should not be excluded from engagement in one of our most important international financial institutions. As H.R. 910 requires, the U.S. would be an advocate that the IMF admit Taiwan as a member, allowing the IMF to monitor and evaluate the health of Taiwan's economy, provide technical support to Taiwanese officials, and support employment opportunities at the IMF for Taiwan nationals. Given its contribution to the global economy, Taiwan should certainly not be locked out of membership. Not only will this benefit Taiwan, it will benefit America and the entire world economy. It should be noted, however, that while this legislation will assist Taiwan, some Republicans are ignoring what the administration is doing that will hurt our economy and that of Taiwan. In February 2025, in one of his first actions as President, President Trump issued an executive order seeking to withdraw the United States from several international organizations and calling for recommendations on exiting the U.S. from its membership in certain other organizations, including the IMF. Clearly our ability to advocate for Taiwan at the IMF, to carry out the purposes of this bill, is undermined by the fact that Donald Trump is examining withdrawing us from the IMF. Setting aside the central point that the President has no authority whatsoever to withdraw the United States from international financial institutions, that review, which is due in August, has not been completed. While the IMF funding was included in the recent budget proposal, comments by the administration and the Secretary of the Treasury confirm that Trump has not decided whether to try to use what powers he has as President to withdraw us from the IMF.  {time}  1600  Most significantly, Trump has refused to reiterate the policy that the U.S. has had in place since 1979, standing with the people and security of Taiwan. When asked if the U.S. will maintain its decades- old commitment to Taiwan, Trump has repeatedly avoided the easy answer, declaring loudly that he won't provide a direct response. We should pass this bill, but we should also urge our President to not undermine Taiwan and not undermine the world economy by talking about withdrawing the United States from the IMF. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time."
"Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for this important question. We are not only supporting our members as they are outside of the community in evacuation centres. We are offering wraparound services, including mental health and health care, and working with first nations bands and communities to support them in their administrative processes as they are not able to offer that service in the community, including ensuring that payroll is carried out and responding to the needs of HR processes outside of the community. These are all critical aspects of supporting them so that they can continue working for their members, be it in a position of coordinating evacuation or ensuring that payments are made to members in this time of crisis. I also want to acknowledge that many first nations communities have stepped up, with their capacity and their expertise, to support their fellow first nations members and relations, bringing them into a space to feel welcomed and communicated with, and to ensure that it is done in a culturally safe way. We are looking to build that relationship beyond and outside the scope, inviting our partners and government to work with us and collaborate with us. I look forward, asking all members of this chamber for support in this time of crisis."
"I rise today to recognize two exceptional students from the greater Lehigh Valley, Adam Wyatt and Ria Gandotra, recipients of the 2025 Congressional Award Gold Medal, the highest honor Congress can bestow upon a civilian youth. Adam, a student at Nazareth Area High School and an Eagle Scout, has used the program to build leadership skills, service, and discipline. From studying Russian and leading his family on a 19-day European tour to interviewing local veterans, he has taken on challenges that show real initiative and follow-through. Ria, a student at Moravian Academy, volunteered at a camp for children with special needs, worked to better herself academically, played on her school's tennis team, and planned a family trip to Toronto. Her work reflects both compassion and determination and a clear commitment to personal and civic growth. Adam and Ria exemplify the values of service, perseverance, and personal development. I am proud to recognize their achievements and the positive impact they have had on their local community as young leaders in the greater Lehigh Valley."
"I thank my hon. Friend for raising the issue. He is aware that we took the difficult decision to raise employers' national insurance contributions so that we could get our NHS back on its feet, and that is what we have been doing since the Budget. We are providing the support needed against any knock-on effects to social care providers and key charities, particularly through the additional boost that we have given to local authorities in their funding. He may want to raise this issue with the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, who will be in the Chamber shortly."
"Members will be able to see how many are standing. I do not intend to put a formal time limit on, but if Members can keep their contributions below five minutes, everybody will just about squeeze in."
"It goes to the point made by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Cameron Thomas), who talked about his experience as a young driver and being a more responsible driver now. I would echo that myself, and I am sure most people recognise that in themselves. Some of it is inexperience, sometimes it is just plain stupidity, but that education is important to help tackle the issue, and ensure that people understand the potential consequences of such actions both for themselves and for other people. A particularly good education piece was done in north-east Scotland, when children from all over the area went to a large venue and were given a hard-hitting and pretty blunt message, including videos of serious road accidents where people had been either seriously injured or killed. When they went into the venue they saw a fine-looking car; when they came out, that car had been crushed as if it had been in an accident. That was a hard-hitting experience, and lots of young people came out of it with a new respect for driving and using motor vehicles. I turn now to off-road and quad bikes, and particularly e-bikes, which the amendment is focused on. The SNP supports Police Scotland and its partners in dealing with illegally modified vehicles and the misuse of off-road vehicles. The Scottish Government are considering ways forward, in partnership with Police Scotland and local authorities, to tackle vehicle nuisance and related safety issues. That includes continuing to liaise with the UK Government--a lot of work has gone on behind the scenes between the devolved Administrations and the UK Government, and I welcome that work by the Minister and her civil servants, which has been helpful. The ongoing collaboration ensures that Scottish interests are considered in any UK-wide decisions affecting road safety. We are also considering further options, including liaising with the UK Government on a cross-party basis, and community engagement regarding the potential use of mobile safety camera vans to deter registered vehicles from speeding on public roads. The amendment calls on the Government to conduct a consultation on licensing and tracking the ownership of e-bikes and  e-scooters, which in many cases are required to be insured, although the public are generally not aware of that. I will make a final plea to the insurance sector, which I think could be doing a lot more to make it clear to people what insurance does and does not cover. The modification of vehicles--that was raised earlier by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Jo White)--is one such issue, and I do not recall seeing a great deal about that in insurance documents I have received over the years. The insurance industry could do a lot more to increase public awareness and try to tackle such issues and support the Scottish and UK Governments in their objectives."
"it is a privilege to rise today to recognize Mr. Zachary LaDuke for his service at Withlacoochee River Electric Cooperative (WREC) and his remarkable role in the Light Up Navajo Project. In May, a courageous team of 16 WREC employees traveled over 1,800 miles to the remote, rugged terrains of Arizona and New Mexico, where they spent two weeks installing vital electrical infrastructure for Navajo families who have lived without power for generations. Their efforts brought light, safety, and hope to communities long overlooked, allowing children to study after dark, families to preserve food, and elders to live with greater comfort. Despite daunting challenges and limited equipment, the WREC team completed a demanding project in just eight days--far ahead of expectations--demonstrating professionalism, humility, and unwavering commitment to this life-changing mission. The impact of WREC's work goes far beyond electricity; it represents a bridge to connection, opportunity, and the return of future generations to their ancestral homes. The emotional moment when power was turned on for the impacted families--bringing tears of joy and renewed hope--is a testament to the profound difference this project made. WREC's participation in the ``Light Up Navajo'' initiative reflects not only their technical expertise but also their heart and respect for the people they serve. Their dedication has energized ten homesteads and countless lives, creating a legacy of service that embodies the true spirit of cooperative values. The WREC team's journey inspires us all, proving that with compassion and teamwork, even the most daunting challenges can be overcome to light up lives and communities. I commend the entire team for their efforts on this worthwhile endeavor and for their ongoing service to our local community."
I interrupt the hon. member as I have a point of order. The hon. member for Cariboo—Prince George.
"A constituent contacted me specifically about the digital inclusion action plan, explaining that because of his voice disability, spasmodic dysphonia, he struggles to access essential services such as banking,  because automated phone systems could not understand his voice. There is often no clear way of bypassing those systems, and alternatives like webchat are slow and ineffective. This is a growing issue for many people with communication disabilities. What steps is the Minister taking, with Cabinet colleagues, to ensure that services remain accessible, and will the issue be addressed through the action plan?"
"I have been contacted by a significant number of constituents who are currently stranded in Israel, unable to leave because of the lack of flights to the United Kingdom. This includes a constituent with significant medical needs. I urge the Foreign Secretary to further strengthen the Foreign Office's offer. I do welcome the advice it is now providing on routes back to the UK, although I note that it has taken some time for that to happen. What contingency plans are the Foreign Office and wider Government undertaking for repatriation should the situation deteriorate further and that be required, and are they registering details of UK nationals in Israel to that end?"
"The time has elapsed for providing an answer. Proceeding with debate, the member for Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan."
"I rise today to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Loma Ridge air disaster. On June 25, 1965, 60 years ago, a military jet took off from El Toro Marine base in Orange County. It was heading to Vietnam. After takeoff, the jet plunged into a mountain, killing all 84 persons onboard. This remains Orange County's worst air disaster. Today, I honor the 72 marines and 12 airmen who lost their lives that day. I thank them and their families for making the ultimate sacrifice for our great Nation."
"I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 48, S. 98. The clerk will report the bill by title. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:  A bill (S. 98) to require the Federal Communications Commission to establish a vetting process for prospective applicants for high-cost universal service program funding.  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill."
"I join the hon. Gentleman in thanking all those involved in citizenAID in his constituency. It sounds like a great initiative. He is absolutely right: we need more contingency provision and to train people up so they know what to do during these kinds of incidents. When they happen, we always rely on volunteers and volunteer organisations like the one he has described. This sounds like a good topic for an Adjournment debate."
We come to the shadow Secretary of State.
"Mr. Chair, in the opinion of the minister, have the air passenger protection regulations been a success or a failure?"
"It is not to continue the argument, is it?"
"I rise today to honor a giant in Nebraska journalism, Andrew Ozaki. Over the course of his 43-year career, Ozaki led KETV's Lincoln bureau and built a reputation for both tenacity and kindness. Whether he was covering the unicameral, the Governor's office, sports, or more, Andrew Ozaki was everywhere covering everything. From staking out legislative hearings to running up and down the sidelines of Husker football games, Ozaki relentlessly chased stories that have shaped public policy, entertained crowds, and brought our entire State together. As he prepares to retire from KETV, his absence will be noticed not just by the numerous people he covered but by the audiences who relied on his accurate stories. Wherever Andrew's next chapter takes him, his integrity, compassion, and commitment to storytelling have left a mark on our State that will endure for years to come."
"Mr. Speaker, every sector of the economy in Canada should be doing its fair share when it comes to limiting pollution. That includes the oil and gas sector. Canada's largest oil and gas companies are already committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, and I applaud them. Our measures are working. Canada's greenhouse gas pollution is going down. In every sector of the economy, Canadian workers are lowering greenhouse gas pollution in a way that creates good jobs and cleaner air. In the face of the increased flooding, wildfires and hurricanes from a change in climate, the government will continue to work with the oil and gas sector, provinces, territories, stakeholders and indigenous communities to promote clean innovation and the adoption of technologies to reduce emissions, including carbon capture, utilization and storage."
"Madam Chair, were any victim rights organizations consulted during the drafting process of Bill C-2 ?"
"Madam Speaker, I fully appreciate that. Even at the Festival des boulettes, we really want to get people talking. That is how to build a harmonious society, even in politics. I might add that I come from a municipal background. I was a city councillor in Montreal, where there are sometimes competing interests between boroughs. Progress can be made despite that. When we say that we are one country, we can move forward, not for the sake of the provinces, but for the sake of Canadians. What matters is having jobs here with investors from here. That is what we are trying to do with this bill."
"Mr. Speaker, I know that this is going to be shocking to my colleague from the Bloc, whom I respect a great deal, but the Liberals say one thing during a campaign and do something very different once they have been elected. The Liberals like to say that they are not ready and that it has been only three months. The cabinet has been there for 10 years. It is not like the Liberals just came into a new House of Commons and have no idea what has been going on for the last 10 years. They have caused all the problems. Their overspending, high taxes and bad policies have put Canada in this financial situation. I would argue that the Liberals do not want to table a budget because Canadians would be frightened to see the financial situation the Liberals have left us in."
"May I start by wishing two Deputy Speakers a happy birthday? [Hon. Members: ""Hear, hear.""] As the right hon. Gentleman said, this is Armed Forces Week, when we thank and show our support for the men and women who serve, or who have served, in our armed forces over many years. It is nice to see the right hon. Gentleman in his place again this week, because we have missed him quite a bit recently, but I might gently suggest that if he had been here last week, he could have asked last week's questions last week instead of asking them this week. He asks me about the welfare Bill. As I have just announced to the House, the Second Reading of the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill will take place next Tuesday, and the remaining stages of the Bill will take place on the Floor of the House the following week. I want to reassure colleagues that we take parliamentary scrutiny and the process of Bills extremely seriously. That is what our parliamentary democracy is all about: Bills are introduced; principles are considered at Second Reading; and the details receive robust debate and discussion, and are often amended in Committee, before we consider Third Reading. As the House would expect, the Government actively engage with parliamentary opinion throughout a Bill's passage, as we are doing intensively with the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill. I am sure that the whole House can agree that our welfare system needs reform. Too many people are consigned to benefits for life without support to work and to get on. During the pandemic in particular, the number of those on sickness and disability benefits rose significantly, and the previous Government did nothing to re-engage people with the labour market afterwards. One in eight young people are now not earning or learning. Many post-industrial communities have been scarred over generations by worklessness and little job creation. As constituency MPs, we have all seen the inadequate and, frankly, degrading nature of disability benefits reassessments. Addressing these deep-seated problems is at the core of our Labour principles and what we are trying to do with our welfare reforms. I just remind colleagues that these include: the biggest permanent increase to the standard out-of-work benefit since 1980; an end to reassessments for all those with serious health conditions; creating a more holistic and professionally-led assessments process; the biggest back to work programme in a generation; the right to try work; and ending the era of consigning people as unable to work. To be clear, it is the Conservatives' legacy that this Government now have to sort out--their legacy of one in 10 working-age people on sickness or disability benefits; their legacy of a generation of young people with no mental health support and poor skills; their legacy of over 7 million people on NHS waiting lists; and their legacy of inaction on welfare reforms over years and  years. Quite honestly, the right hon. Gentleman has a brass neck, because the Conservatives have written the book on Government chaos, have they not? There were three Prime Ministers in three years; they sent the markets into chaos, with Budgets done on the back of a fag packet--they really did write the book on that one--there was by-election after by-election for misconduct; over 40 Ministers resigned in a single day; billions were wasted on crony covid contracts; public services were left on their knees; and industrial action was sweeping the country, costing us all dear. All of that left ordinary people paying the price with higher bills, higher mortgages and longer waiting lists. However, this is not just about welfare reform; it is also about the context in which this sits in, and that is what this Government are getting on with doing--this Government's mission to create good, decent, well-paid jobs in every community; this Government's mission to bring down waiting lists and deal with the deep-seated health inequalities in this country; this Government's mission to tackle child poverty; this Government's mission to build more affordable and social housing, giving people a bedrock in life; and this Government's mission to revolutionise skills and opportunities for young people. That is this Labour Government, with our Labour values, getting on with the job and delivering for people."
"I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising this really important issue for his constituents. I think it does impact rural areas in particular. We have set out record funding for the NHS. We have our cancer plan, and I can give him that reassurance."
"Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary had the audacity to mention the Portapique shooting to justify the Liberal government's attack on gun owners. The brutal murderer, in that case, used illegally acquired guns. He himself did not legally own them. It is disgraceful that the government would take advantage of those victims to score political points off the backs of law-abiding gun owners. He should be ashamed, and I hope he apologizes for that. Will the government, since clearly the minister and the parliamentary secretary do not know anything about the gun file, abandon this half-baked confiscation scheme, which targets only law-abiding owners, not killers, not gang murderers and not those who are actually responsible for breaking the law?"
"Mr. Speaker, I want to welcome to the chamber my colleague across the way as a new colleague. The new Prime Minister , as the party wants him to be known, has also introduced the concept of new accounting. With all the measures that the member outlined in her speech, what would be her rationale for the thought that the government should now split the main estimates and the record of debt into two separate categories: operational versus capital spending? Is it to capture differential interest rates on our debt, which keeps on growing and growing? What would be the rationale for that? Is it actually to provide the mirage of a balance in one portion while we continue to incur debt for our next generations?"
"One horrific example of why we must stop supplying the parts for the F-35 fighter jets is the al-Mawasi attack last July. F-35s dropped 2,000 lb bombs on a designated safe zone in Gaza, killing 90 civilians and injuring 300. The use of such powerful munitions in densely populated areas is clearly a violation of international humanitarian law. As my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool Riverside (Kim Johnson) said, key parts of the F-35s that carried out that attack may well have come from Britain; they clearly have done in other attacks. If we want to avoid any complicity in such Israeli war crimes, do we not need to stop these exports immediately?"
"Mr. Speaker, I listened closely to my colleague's speech. It is no secret that there is a lot missing. Members may already know this, but I am extremely disappointed. We were told that we need to work quickly to reassure people. Here we are with a Speech from the Throne that is missing so much. I will give an example. We are well aware that people 65 to 74, seniors, are victims of discrimination. In the last Parliament, all the bill needed was royal assent. Not a single day went by in the election campaign without this being brought up to me. I would like my colleague to tell me where things stand with reducing and increasing what people 65 to 74 need to live."
"I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing Central and Acton (Dr Huq) for securing the debate, and I thank the other Members who have spoken. As my hon. Friend has said, more than 50,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, and one in eight will be diagnosed with it during their lifetime. I commend her for raising an issue that I know is very personal to her, as she has articulated so well. I am sure that her late father is watching her carefully. She was also right to support her constituent Peter by raising this issue, which affects so many men, and to highlight the number of black and minority ethnic men presenting with the disease. That is something on which we have all campaigned very strongly. Timely and equitable diagnosis and access to innovative medicines for the treatment of prostate cancer are of the utmost importance. To support faster diagnosis, NHS England has redesigned pathways to maximise capacity. We are also aware of very early-stage trials of the use of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection, and we look forward to a formal report on those trials, so that the evidence can be considered carefully."
"Mr. Speaker, it is always such a pleasure to hear my colleague from Acadia speak. Whenever she and I talk, I can sense the enthusiasm and dedication that she demonstrated in a few words just now. Yes, the Canadian dental care plan is making people's lives a lot better. I believe some 15,000 seniors and children in my colleague's riding have already benefited from it, and another 15,000 adults between the ages of 18 and 64 will soon qualify for this life-changing plan. It puts more money in their pockets and, above all, it gives them the tools they need to take care of their oral health, which is extremely important, because then they can focus on the other aspects of their health."
"My hon. Friend is making an excellent speech about choices, but this is also about fairness. The compulsory purchase powers contained in part 5 of the Bill disregard any hope value over and above agricultural value, which is not fair at all for those landowners who are having their land compulsorily acquired. If my hon. Friend's new clause were accepted, the 20% to which he refers would be 20% of the agricultural value rather than the market value, as the Government have stipulated, so less money would be going into the benefit scheme. Would it not be better if the Government were advocating market value for compulsory purchase, rather than disregarding it in favour of agricultural value?"
I reserve the balance of my time.
"Mr. Speaker, after the lost Liberal decade, the dream of home ownership continues to be a nightmare. A new study ranks Toronto as having one of the least affordable housing markets in the world. Construction costs are up 58%, and zoning delays mean it takes up to 32 months to approve a single project in Toronto. It is no wonder Canada is short two million homes. Housing costs will average 52% of household income this year, according to a new federal memo, and that is up from 38% in 2015. I have heard from far too many families in the GTHA that now teeter on the brink because their monthly payments are up by thousands of dollars, and young Canadians who have yet to enter the market have simply given up. Even the new housing minister admits it is a crisis but says it is a slow-moving creature. After five housing ministers in six years, Canadians cannot wait any longer."
"The hon. Member for East Thanet (Ms Billington) is quite right: back in 2010, the Napster provision was first enacted through the Digital Economy Act. Such provision is possible, and I just do not understand the Minister's reticence about this amendment. It seems an entirely reasonable amendment to bring forward--it does everything that everybody wants to achieve when it comes to this Bill. Even if the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment, could he at least say that he accepts the principles of it and what it requires, and that he will do all he can to bring forward all the provisions it asks for?"
"Mr. Speaker, as they say, the best time to plant a tree was yesterday. Last week, I had the pleasure of attending the annual tree giveaway held by the Bayview Village Association. Each year, the BVA offers residents trees and shrubs that are native to Toronto and suited for our urban environment, and it holds a workshop on how to properly plant them. I advise the House of this great community effort because trees reduce flooding and erosion, provide shade, decrease heating and cooling costs and clean the air. I want to take this occasion to thank the Bayview Village Association and acknowledge the natural care and strong community spirit that exist in the BVA. I commend the team of volunteers involved for helping us breathe a little easier. In my riding, it is not just trees that are growing; it is the community spirit."
All those opposed to the member's moving the motion will please say nay. It is agreed. The House has heard the terms of the motion. All those opposed to the motion will please say nay. (Motion agreed to)
"Mr. Speaker, we just learned moments ago that former parliamentarian Marc Garneau has passed away at the age of 76. I would ask for unanimous consent for a moment of silence from the House for that."
"I congratulate the Chancellor on the spending review, and welcome her commitment both to defence spending and to our being a defence industrial superpower, which is vital to my community in Aldershot and Farnborough. This week, my hon. Friend the Member for York Outer (Mr Charters) and I published a report entitled ""Rewiring British Defence Financing"", which supports the Chancellor's work to fire up our defence industrial base. As part of that, will she support my campaign for a UK-led multilateral defence security and resilience bank to finance our national resilience, support our allies, and keep our country safe?"
"Mr. Speaker, Finland is also undertaking this big project. They announced their purchase of F-35 jets around the same time Canada did, in early 2022. Finland purchased 64 jets, Canada 88. The Auditor General has reported that facilities and training for the F-35s are years behind schedule. The Finns' F-35s will achieve full operational capability in 2030. The government will not achieve that until at least 2033-34, years behind the Finns. Why can the government not deliver these jets on time and on budget?"
"I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. In West Ealing, in my constituency, we have seen all the banks close over the past decade or so. In fact, the town centre itself has visibly declined, in the way that he alluded to. Does he agree that the Labour Government's decision to permanently reduce business rates for retail and hospitality businesses and to end the scourge of late payments, along with the 350 banking hubs that he mentions, will help revitalise places like West Ealing?"
"Mr. Speaker, I disagree with the member when he tries to give the impression that the people of Quebec were tricked in the last election. I believe the people of Quebec, much like the people in Manitoba, understood that the primary issue in the election was no doubt that of genuine concern over Trump's tariffs and trade. I think they looked at what was out there and voted accordingly. The Bloc had the opportunity to make its case. It did not make its case strong enough. I respect what the people of Quebec, and equally the people of Manitoba, voted for. To try to say that our constituents or the voters were being tricked is not appropriate. The voters in Quebec did a fine job in recognizing the important issues of the province."
"I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is aware, but Governments have always had the policy that we do not comment on what advice the Attorney General has provided, or indeed whether he has provided any advice at all. That ensures Ministers can get the advice they need to carry out Government business and make decisions without fear or favour."
"I thank the gentlewoman from North Dakota for her remarks. I appreciate my colleagues for participating this evening. This is something historic, and it is something monumental. As I was talking about at the beginning of my remarks, when I first ran for Congress in January 2020, the entire conversation of every single candidate was: How do we go about extending and making permanent the tax reform that just took place in our country a few years prior and the juice that it created for our economy and the growth that it had that was raising the tide of all income levels? That was the concept, and 4\1/2\ years later, I am sitting here on the committee particularly regarding the tax policy to be able to bring it up. This is a unique and really special time. We are already engaging with the Senate to make sure this can adhere to and go through the Byrd rule, all the specifics of making this a reality. This is an exciting moment. It will be monumental, and it will do so much good. I have always said, as I have been involved in congressional policymaking, that we live in 2-year increments, but every CEO across the country has to live in 15-year increments. They have to see what is around the corner, and we are constantly putting people at an impasse because we just keep dealing with 2-year increments of what their policies are going to be. We have to signal what the future holds with respect to tax policy, and there is nothing that would do more for sustained economic growth than this bill. Again, Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the time this evening and for my colleagues being here to share the message. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."
"Let me be clear: I was not seeking to disparage the efforts of activists or protesters. My hon. Friend asks when we will suspend arms to Gaza. We  have suspended arms to Gaza. I hear the frustration of the House, but the Labour Government took steps, and I am proud of the steps that we have taken. I hear the frustration--that Members want us to go further--but let us not pretend that this Government have done nothing. The scenes in Gaza are deeply distressing. The Government have been clear, as I have been clear this afternoon, that we will take further steps if things do not change, but we have taken measures and we will continue to do so."
"Mr. Chair, I will spot the minister; I am feeling generous. In 2015, it was 250,000. That is an increase of 107,000, or 40%, in the last 10 years. Are taxpayers getting 40% more out of their federal government?"
"I thank the Prime Minister very much for his statement. Nobody in the House can doubt the sincerity of his careful words and commitment to what is best for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the G7 and NATO summit. The Prime Minister will be aware of my support for Israel and that of so many in this great nation. The situation was, I believe, one of the major issues of the summit. Can the Prime Minister please outline whether time was taken, with our closest ally, the United States of America, to discuss steps that can be taken to cut the head off the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, ensure that the USA bombing of the Iranian nuclear programme was a success and thereby secure a truce and lasting peace in the middle east?"
"I refer right hon. and hon. Members to my entry on the Register of Members' Financial Interests--I am an NHS consultant paediatrician. The debate so far has focused primarily on ethical considerations, legal frameworks and who will be eligible--the who, the when and the why--but I want to focus my remarks on the how. As a doctor, I know that various drugs in different combinations can be fatal; in other words, there is more than one way to kill people. Which would be the best drug, if that is what we wished to do? Which would be the most comfortable, and how do we know? Some forms of assisted dying use neuromuscular blockades, which, in common parlance, means that they paralyse the body. Imagine a situation where someone in a lot of pain is given such a drug; from the outside they would look relaxed and peaceful as their muscles relaxed, but inside they would be in a lot of pain, and unable to express that to anybody else. Do we want people to be comfortable and to know that they are comfortable, or only to appear comfortable to us? Clearly, we want them to be comfortable inside as well. We therefore need to have drugs that are properly understood and regulated for this purpose. Assisted dying is often portrayed as safe, peaceful and controlled, but the reality in comparable countries where it has been legalised so far is more complicated. Technical difficulties frequently arise, leading to complications causing greater suffering, requiring intervention and potentially leading to a prolonged and painful death. A report in The BMJ by Dr Suzy Lishman, former president of the Royal College of Pathologists--who, I should say, works at the same trust as me--showed that there is a lack of reliable data on the effectiveness and safety of the drugs used, largely due to inconsistent reporting in jurisdictions where such dying is legal. In Belgium it is estimated that only 52% of euthanasia cases are reported to the Federal Commission for the Control and Evaluation of Euthanasia. During a Select Committee visit in the last Parliament to Oregon to discuss assisted dying, which I and two other hon. Members from the Labour Benches went on, we heard about the complications being unknown in 71% of cases. No healthcare professional was present when the drugs were given so we could not really know, and we did not even know if the drugs had been taken in some cases. Where we did, we found a history of seizures, vomiting and prolonged deaths. On having  been given the drugs, patients in nine cases in Oregon in 2023 had reawakened later. How they felt in the intervening time is difficult for us to know. In Washington, a 2018 report found that 31% of patients took more than 90 minutes to die. I also remind hon. Members that an absence of evidence that things are not going well is not evidence of an absence of things going wrong."
"Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Québécois agrees to apply the vote and will be voting in favour."
"Does the Secretary of State agree that this Bill has a missing half, which could cut aviation emissions by demand management, and that at the very least, if there is to be public money spent setting up this system, it should be raised from the most frequent flyers and private jets?"
"Mr. Speaker, when dangerous people commit violent crimes, it is important they face serious criminal penalties. I would point out to the hon. member that extortion is illegal in this country, and its perpetrators must be apprehended and punished in accordance with the Criminal Code. When he looks at the mandatory minimum penalties, he will see that repeat violent offences involving firearms have a mandatory minimum penalty of seven years and a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The Criminal Code is a serious document that will treat serious criminals very seriously. I look forward to working with members of the Conservative Party to give law enforcement the tools it needs not only to punish criminals but also to prevent crime in the first place."
"It is with immense pride that I rise today in Armed Forces Week, particularly as the national celebrations are returning to Cleethorpes this weekend. That will be a moment of real honour for our community in Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes, nearly 10 years after the last time we hosted such an event, in 2016--and my, hasn't a lot happened in those years? To have it return under a Labour Government is an incredibly proud moment. My constituency may not have garrison towns such as those that my colleagues represent, but our ties to the military run deep and proud. From American GIs camped in Grimsby's People's park during the second world war, to the brave men and women who gave everything to their country to support the war effort-- including our towns' fishermen, as well as my great-grandma May and my great aunt Kathleen, who both took roles as wartime wardens in their village of Healing--our towns have long stood shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces. Those connections continue today, with the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment, a reserve battalion, operating out of Westward Ho in Grimsby, and training and serving with distinction across our area and further afield. Their commitment really does reflect the values that define our area: resilience, solidarity and service. Every Remembrance Sunday, they open their doors to the whole of the local community in order to provide refreshments to the young cadets--the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Ben Obese-Jecty) just mentioned cadets--who will be out parading this Sunday."
Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
"With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I will remind the House that the Foreign Office has been responding to two crises in this past week. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Lincoln (Mr Falconer), will update the House on the Government's extensive efforts to assist those whose loved ones lost their lives in Thursday's devastating Air India plane crash. Just nine days ago, I was in Delhi, strengthening our friendship. Our nations are mourning together, and my thoughts are with those suffering such terrible loss. With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I will now turn to the middle east. Early last Friday morning, Israel launched extensive strikes across Iran. The targets included military sites, the uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, key commanders and nuclear scientists. The last 72 hours have seen Iranian ballistic missile and drone strikes across Israel, killing at least 21 Israelis and injuring hundreds more, and Israeli strikes have continued, including on targets in Tehran, with the Iranian authorities reporting scores of civilian casualties. Prime Minister Netanyahu has said that his operations will ""continue for as many days as it takes to remove the threat"". Supreme Leader Khamenei has said Israel ""must expect severe punishment"". In such a crisis, our first priority is of course the welfare of British nationals. On Friday, we swiftly stood up crisis teams in London and the region. Yesterday, I announced that we now advise against all travel to Israel; that is in addition to our long-standing travel advice not to go to Iran. Today, I can update the House: we are asking all British nationals in Israel to register their presence with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, so that we can share important information on the situation and leaving the country. I can announce today that we are further updating our travel advice to signpost border crossing points, and we are sending rapid deployment teams to Egypt and Jordan to bolster our consular presence near the border with Israel. That presence has already been supporting British nationals on the ground. Israel and Iran have closed their airspace until further notice, and our ability to provide support in Iran is therefore extremely limited. British nationals in the region should closely monitor our travel advice for further updates. The situation remains fast-moving. We expect more strikes in the days to come. This is a moment of grave danger for the region. I want to be clear: the United Kingdom was not involved in the strikes against Iran. This is military action conducted by Israel. It should come as no surprise that Israel considers the Iranian nuclear programme an existential threat. Khamenei said in 2018 that Israel was a ""cancerous tumour"" that should be ""removed and eradicated"". We have always supported Israeli security. That is why Britain has sought to prevent Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon through extensive diplomacy. We agree with President Trump when he says that negotiations are necessary and must lead to a deal. That has long been the view of the so-called E3--Britain, and France and  Germany, with whom we have worked so closely on this issue. It is the view of all the G7, which has backed the efforts of President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff. For more than two decades, it has been the cross-party view in this House. Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton and Lord Hague of Richmond led diplomatic efforts on this issue, as did Baroness May of Maidenhead and the former right hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. This Government have continued to pursue negotiations, joining France and Germany in five rounds of talks with Iran this year alone. Ours is a hard-headed, realist assessment of how best to tackle this grave threat. Fundamentally, no military action can put an end to Iran's nuclear capabilities. Just last week, the International Atomic Energy Agency board of governors passed a non-compliance resolution against Iran, the first such IAEA finding in 14 years. The director general's comprehensive report details Iran's failure to declare nuclear materials. Iran remains the only state without nuclear weapons accumulating uranium at such dangerously high levels. Its total enriched stockpile is now 40 times the limit in the joint comprehensive plan of action. Its nuclear programme is part of a wider pattern of destabilising activity. The Government have taken firm action in response. When Iran transferred ballistic missiles for use in Russia's illegal war in Ukraine, we imposed extensive sanctions, including against Iran Air, and we cancelled our bilateral air services agreement. In the face of unacceptable Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps threats here in the UK--there have been some 20 foiled plots since 2022--the Crown Prosecution Service has for the first time charged Iranian nationals under the National Security Act 2023, and we have placed the Iranian state, including the IRGC, on the enhanced tier of the new foreign influence registration scheme. A widening war would have grave and unpredictable consequences, including for our partners in Jordan and the Gulf: the horrors of Gaza worsening, tensions in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq rising, and the Houthi threat continuing. That is why the Government's firm view is--as it was last October, at the time of the ballistic missile attack on Israel--that further escalation in the middle east is not in Britain's interests, or in the interests of Israel, Iran or the region. There are hundreds of thousands of British nationals living in the region, and with Iran a major oil producer and with oil flowing through the strait of Hormuz accounting for a fifth of total world oil consumption, escalating conflict poses real risks for the global economy. As missiles rain down, Israel has a right to defend itself and its citizens, but our priority now is de-escalation. Our message to both Israel and Iran is clear: step back, show restraint, and do not get pulled ever deeper into a catastrophic conflict, the consequences of which no one can control. The Prime Minister chaired Cobra to discuss the situation last Friday, and spoke to Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The Prime Minister is now at the G7 summit in Canada, discussing with our closest allies how to ease tensions. The Government have deployed additional assets to the region, including jets for contingency support for UK forces and, potentially, our regional allies concerned about the escalating conflict. In the last 72 hours the Minister for the Middle East, my hon.   Friend the Member for Lincoln (Mr Falconer), and I have been working flat out trying to carve out space for diplomacy. I have spoken to Israeli Foreign Minister Sa'ar and Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi, underlining Britain's focus on de-escalation. I have also met the Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal, and had calls with United States Secretary of State Rubio, European Union High Representative Kallas, and my counterparts from France and Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. Those conversations are part of a collective drive to prevent a spiralling conflict. This new crisis has arisen as the appalling situation in Gaza continues. This weekend, hospitals in Gaza reported that over 50 people had been killed and more than 500 had been injured while trying to access food. This Government will not take our eye off the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. We will not stop calling for aid restrictions to be lifted and for an immediate ceasefire, and we will not forget about the hostages. This morning I met Yocheved Lifschitz and her family, whose courage and dignity in the face of Hamas's barbarism were a reminder of the plight of those still cruelly held in Gaza. We will not stop striving to free the hostages and end the war. Our vision remains unchanged: an end to Iran's nuclear programme and destabilising regional activity, Israel secure in its borders and at peace with its neighbours, and a sovereign Palestinian state, as part of a two-state solution. Diplomacy is indispensable to each of those goals. Britain will keep pressing all sides to choose a diplomatic path out of this crisis. I commend this statement to the House."
"Mr. Speaker, I absolutely disagree with the premise of the question. What we have here is a government that actually stole many of its ideas from Conservatives. The Liberals say they are going to do these things, yet they have a Speech from the Throne that is ambiguous enough that they will be able to not undertake the things they are promising. They are not bringing forward a budget, so we do not know what their plan is. There is no road map to get us where they say they want to go, and it remains to be seen if they will actually end up getting us there."
"I strongly welcome the Home Secretary's announcement of an inquiry and its commitment to survivors. It is absolutely right that the inquiry focuses on local areas where we know that survivors have been failed by the authorities that were supposed to protect them, but it is also essential that we draw lessons for the whole UK. Earlier this year, Professor Alexis Jay from the University of Strathclyde warned the Home Affairs Committee that Scotland is not immune to the kind of organised abuse that we have witnessed elsewhere in the UK. Scotland's victims and survivors deserve the same assurances on accountability and robust safeguarding measures as anywhere else in the UK, so will the Home Secretary actively seek engagement with the Scottish Government, and offer them support and advice to ensure that they wholeheartedly implement the Jay recommendations effectively?"
"Mr. Speaker, I heard the member opposite heckling me for the first five to 10 minutes of my comments. I think the member, more than anyone else, does not necessarily like to hear the truth. When it comes to truth and transparency, I am always happy to talk about the many things this government has been doing. There are many members of the Liberal caucus who have stood up and added value to the discussions and the debate. For some reason, the member seems to be offended if I decide to stand up on behalf of my caucus or my constituents to share some thoughts. He has the option: He does not have to stay in the chamber if he does not want to hear what we have to say."
"I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), the chairman of the Health Subcommittee."
"I am sorry to hear about Monty's story and I fear that we will hear stories like his from Members across the House in this debate. It is a perfect, but shocking, example of how the system is so broken that we are wasting huge amounts of resources. Money is leaking out of a system that is already inadequately funded. My hon. Friend is right to highlight that. It is awful that we are in such a situation. Children, particularly those with high needs, are having to wake up before dawn and travel for over an hour, finding themselves exhausted when they reach school. That is not choice; that is a scandal. It is not just the children with the most acute needs who are suffering; many children and young people could thrive with targeted, mid-level support if only it were available. The number of children with education, health and care plans has exploded since 2015, in reflection of a genuine  increase in need and greater recognition of mental health issues and neurodivergence. Yet funding has not kept pace, resulting in a deficit of around PS33 billion in high needs budgets within local authorities. I welcome the Government's acknowledgment that the current SEND system is not fit for purpose and the recent commitment of PS740 million to deliver 10,000 new SEND places, particularly in mainstream schools where specialist units can offer much-needed support closer to home. Following yesterday's spending review, I look forward to the schools White Paper that will come out in the autumn, with details of the Government's approach to reforming the SEND system. We must ensure that the money goes where it is truly needed. I share the frustration of the right hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Graham Stuart), as Staffordshire is also chronically disadvantaged by the outdated funding formula, with specialist schools in my constituency receiving PS8,000 per pupil less not than Camden but than the national average. A fair, needs-based funding system must reflect the actual costs of specialist provision, not assumptions or averages."
"Mr. Chair, how many of those who have been ordered to leave so far have left Canada?"
"Madam Speaker, before, I was a little bit hesitant, but now I am 100% sure. In regard to the legislation, it does, in fact, provide tax relief for individual first-time homebuyers for condos and co-ops. That is something that was raised as a possible suggestion from the Conservative Party. That is why I say that, when we take a look at the legislation and the ideas that are within this particular bill, I would think the Conservative Party would feel comfortable in supporting them. Does the member support the principles of this bill herself, and can she reflect on what the Conservative Party's feelings are on this legislation?"
"Mr. Chair, teachers give grades, so I would like to know this: What is the minister's response to the CTA's backlog of approximately 80,000 claims?"
"To read about our nuclear defence strategy over the weekend, ahead of the SDR, is quite alarming--just as it is to see this morning that journalists have received all the information and the Opposition still have not had sight of it. The Leader of the House is saying that she is speaking to No. 10 and Cabinet members about the importance of this matter, but did she raise concerns over the weekend when she saw the leaks in the paper?"
"I rise today to honor and congratulate a devoted public servant, Elissa DeVito of Preston, Connecticut. Elissa is retiring from teaching at Waterford Public Schools after over 30 years of dedicated service. Her decades of outstanding expertise and dedication to her community will be sorely missed. Elissa spent her early life in Rockville, Maryland before attending Syracuse University where she met the love of her life, Michael. Elissa moved to Connecticut in May of 1991. She and Michael lived in Groton and Mystic before settling in Preston in 1994, where they have been ever since. Elissa chose a path of public service and has dedicated her life to education and teaching. For decades, she has worked as a teacher, helping to shape the minds of generations of children. She began her career with Waterford Public Schools on November 30, 1992, at Oswegatchie Elementary School. She stayed at Oswegatchie until the fall of 2009 when she transferred to Quaker Hill Elementary School. While Elissa has spent most of her career working with kindergarteners, she has also spent a few years working with first and second graders. Always going above and beyond to create a caring and supportive environment for the students that entered her classroom, it has been Elissa's mission to provide the next generation with the tools they need to succeed. Elissa is a natural educator and has been known as an expert at teaching young students to read. Students go from learning the letters of the alphabet to reading books by the end of their time in her classroom. As she enters retirement, Elissa is looking forward to spending more time reading, one of her favorite pastimes, visiting her daughters, Samantha, Emily, and Alexa and going on trips with her husband Michael. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent constituents as devoted and compassionate as Elissa. Elissa has impacted hundreds of students during her career. Elissa will leave behind an expert skill set and enthusiasm that will be hard to replace, but her 33 years of unwavering dedication to the Waterford community will leave a legacy for years to come through each and every one of her students. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing Elissa DeVito's immeasurable contributions and congratulating her on her well-earned retirement."
"Mr. Speaker, I know that my colleague is a great advocate for rural areas and especially rural health care. We are at a time when it is no longer possible to die or be born in our community because we have to go to urban centres to receive health care. The situation in rural Canada is dire. I would like to hear my colleague explain what the issues are and what he thinks the solution could be for rural health care."
"I rise today to recognize and congratulate the Fauquier High School class of 2025. Last month, the 301 graduates and their families gathered at the packed Jiffy Lube Live to celebrate this milestone. This senior class has a lot to be proud of, including beating their teachers in the students versus faculty basketball game. The graduates excelled not only in the classroom but also on the field and in their ability to persevere through challenges. Whether they are heading into the workforce, trade school, college, or embarking on their service at institutions like the Air Force Academy or Virginia Military Institute, the values of hard work and determination that they learned as a Falcon will always be with them. I congratulate the class of 2025 at Fauquier High School.    Recognizing Rappahannock County High School Class of 2025"
"I rise today with deep pride and gratitude to recognize a truly remarkable individual from my district-- Chief Glenn Forsyth of Newtown Township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. This year, Chief Forsyth is celebrating an incredible milestone--50 years of continuous service with the Newtown Fire Association. Let me repeat that: Five decades of commitment, sacrifice, and leadership in the name of public safety. Glenn's journey with the fire service began in 1975 as a junior firefighter. But really, you could say it started even earlier--his family has proudly served in the Newtown Fire Association since 1915. Service is in his blood. Over the years, Glenn has worn many hats--President, Trustee, Battalion Chief, Safety Officer. At every level, he's brought steady leadership, tireless work ethic, and a deep love for this community. But Chief Forsyth's public service didn't stop at the firehouse. In 1984, he joined the Newtown Township Police Department, where he served for 28 years, ultimately retiring as a respected Police Lieutenant. That experience made him uniquely qualified to lead when Newtown created its first full-time, paid fire chief position in 2012. And who better to take on that role than Glenn Forsyth? Since then, he has guided the department through growth, modernization, and challenges--building a unified team of career and volunteer firefighters, all committed to protecting the people of Newtown. Chief Forsyth has given his entire adult life to the safety and well- being of this township. His name is respected, his leader ship is trusted, and his example is one we should all strive to follow. On behalf of a grateful community, I want to thank Chief Glenn Forsyth for 50 years of extraordinary service. May his legacy of courage and commitment inspire the next generation of firefighters and public servants for many years to come. I congratulate Chief Forsyth. We salute him."
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate my hon. colleague, who represents the other side of the Rivière des Mille Îles. We are neighbours, in a way. He is on the Laval side, while I am in the Lower Laurentians. What concerns did my colleague hear while door-knocking that he was pleased to see included in the Speech from the Throne and that he believes will help us connect with our constituents?"
"We face a once-in-a-generation set of threats, including an imperialist Putin and a completely unreliable President Trump, who we cannot depend on to support our defence. Our nuclear deterrent remains the best and ultimate guarantor of the UK's security. We must ensure that it meets the scale of those challenges, so it is right that the Government should look at ways to guarantee its effectiveness. Delivering the Dreadnought class on time is crucial to that, and I welcome the update that the Secretary of State provided before the recess on those timescales. Looking ahead, it is important that the House understands the purpose of any future addition to our nuclear deterrent, so will the Minister outline what discussions his Department has had on how further additions to the deterrent would positively bolster the UK's security?"
"Madam Speaker, I congratulate the member for La Prairie—Atateken on his election. In his speech, he said that he and his government would protect our economic interests. Today, that same MP had the opportunity to walk the talk by protecting Quebec's economic interests and by asking the federal government to repay the $814 million that it stole from Quebec. The Bloc Québécois is not the only one saying it. The Quebec National Assembly unanimously called on the government to pay that money back. All the elected officials in the Quebec government and the Quebec National Assembly are asking for that money back. How does it feel to be a Quebec MP who is going against the will of the Quebec National Assembly?"
"Mr. Chair, is that a five?"
"No, Mr. Chair. It happened as part of a request by the British Columbia government for a short period of time."
"I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his kind words at the beginning of his question. He is absolutely right that part of my job, which I take incredibly seriously, is to uphold this House in Government, and to ensure that the rest of the Government respect this House, come to this House to be scrutinised, and are open, transparent and available to this House. It is a message that I relay very regularly and I am sure I will relay it again later today. I say gently to him that Government announcements do happen outside of Parliament sitting, and that has long been the case. Managing announcements over the course of a few days can often be a challenge, but I reassure him that on the strategic defence review, we were always going to make the statement to the House today, with the publishing and the laying of the 150-page document to the House first. I reiterate that there is a balance to be struck. People want time to read and digest before they can question the Defence Secretary. That is always a balance, too."
"Mr. Speaker, child care is very important in communities throughout Canada, including my own community of Penticton. British Columbia announced a $10-a-day child care program almost a decade ago. Unfortunately, there has been difficulty with the program because of a lack of child care workers. Without child care workers, we cannot have child care, even if it is free. I was wondering if the member would explain how he would fill the new child care centres with child care workers when there is a lack of them throughout the country."
"Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, with whom I will have the honour of serving on the public safety committee, which will hopefully be convened soon. He talked a lot about privacy. I agree with him. There will be a lot of discussion in committee on this issue, because there is a thin line between protecting security and protecting personal and confidential information. I would like to take him in another direction. The bill would give additional powers to border services officers to inspect rail cars in marshalling yards, for example. Rail cars are currently inspected at the time of import, but not at the time of export. Does he agree with the part of the bill that calls for rail cars to be inspected by border services officers? As a result, is he not concerned that there are not enough officers right now to meet the demand? How does he think the government is going to manage to add more powers when resources are limited?"
"Does the Minister agree that online marketplaces should have a greater responsibility to ensure the safety and authenticity of the products they sell, just like a retailer on our high streets?"
"I rise today to discuss an issue that I am sure affects not just my constituents in Edinburgh West but many of our constituents across the United Kingdom. Since 2018, thousands of civil servants, teachers, doctors, nurses, police officers and firefighters have been waiting for the compensation they are entitled to through the McCloud remedy, after the judgment in the Court of Appeal which ruled that changes to public sector pensions unlawfully discriminated against younger workers. That impacted a huge number of dedicated public servants, including at least 400,000 civil servants and more than half a million teachers. In Scotland, more than 13,000 police officers were impacted and are due remediation, as are around 90,000 NHS workers, according to figures produced by the Scottish Government. It is understandable that, with so many people needing remediation, there could be delays, particularly for more complex cases or older cases that need to be examined manually, but these are having a significant impact on people's lives. Motion lapsed (Standing Order No. Motion made, and Question proposed, That this House do now adjourn.--(Gerald Jones.)"
"Mr. Chair, hospitals are bursting at the seams. Frontline staff are exhausted. Doctors are overworked. Why is the minister admitting more immigrants without even removing those who have overstayed their visa?"
"Mr. Speaker, the member is correct that the bill does provide the government with discretion to approve projects. I guess where the Conservatives and the Bloc separate is the fact that the Bloc members voted for Bill C-69 . They supported the industrial carbon tax. This is the very reason Bill C-5 is necessary. Will the member vote with Conservatives to eliminate Bill C-69 ?"
"I echo my colleague's thanks to our colleague from Maryland for anchoring this incredibly important hour. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend food assistance, not just in my district, but for millions of Americans across this country. Republicans passed a bill out of this Chamber enacting the largest ever cut to food assistance in our Nation's history. This ploy will put extreme pressure on our food banks, leave millions of Americans hungry, and force families to make impossible choices. Let me be clear: Hunger is not inevitable. Letting people be hungry is a policy choice. Republicans are choosing to rip the food out of hungry people, hungry families' mouths. For what? To give tax breaks to billionaires. I want to share a story from Rita, a woman in Portland who wrote to my office claiming if Federal food assistance was cut, she will have to choose between buying groceries and paying rent, buying groceries or paying the electric bill. This is not an unfamiliar story for me as a physician, who heard my patients struggling with similar choices. The cruelty of this bill is not just unconscionable, it is heartless. We are talking about real people battling hunger. In the wealthiest country in the world, Americans shouldn't have to struggle so much just to get by. People deserve to thrive. Republicans are choosing, again, to give tax breaks for the wealthiest on the backs of working Americans. One in six community members in my district rely on SNAP. Seniors, children, veterans, and people with disabilities will go hungry. Food stamps aren't a handout. SNAP helps veterans who served our country and neighbors with disabilities. It feeds seniors on fixed incomes and families with young children. Most of these people have faced unimaginable odds and have nowhere else to turn. We cannot turn our backs on those who need us most. This is a moment for moral clarity. Not one person in this country should go hungry, not one person should be left behind, and certainly not just so billionaires can line their pockets even further. We have time to stop it, but only if we speak up. Stay loud."
"Last week, we set out additional money for the Mayor of the West of England, and today we have announced a fourfold increase in local transport funding, which will be available for communities across the country. The hon. Member says that he wants to grow the economy--it is disappointing that the Liberal Democrats voted against the Planning and Infrastructure Bill yesterday, which will do exactly that."
"Mr. Chair, Bill C-2 is a border bill. We are talking about sex offenders and jail. Will the minister keep them there?"
"Was that the answer? It is hardly even looking at the question. In opposition, the Secretary of State for Wales joined Plaid Cymru in condemning the Conservatives for denying Wales PS4.6 billion in rail funding. Now in government, she is waxing lyrical about 10% of that, and she was recently content to move the goalposts and deny Wales a further PS300 million by classifying the Oxford-Cambridge line as benefiting Wales. I don't know how they make this up. Does she oppose that new injustice, or was she ignored? Or is it her mission to see Wales short-changed?"
"We finally have a Labour Government here and in Wales to work together for the people of Clwyd North and across Wales to make those investments, including the significant investments in transport that we have announced today. I pay tribute to all the Welsh Labour MPs who have lobbied me so extensively to get this investment into Welsh rail. I was left with no doubt about what the priority is for the people of Wales: transport investment and investment into coal tip safety. I am pleased to have been able to set that out in the spending review."
"Madam Speaker, when we look at both of the statements that were made, they were highly contradictory. Out west, it was, “Yes, we are going to build pipelines. We are going to develop. We are going to have shovel-ready projects.” Then when the Liberals went to Quebec, it was, “No, there will be a veto. If you don't want something coming through this province, you can veto it.” There was a double standard as to what exactly the Prime Minister intends to do with making Canada more internationally competitive and making sure we can have a robust response to these trade barriers."
"today, June 3, Congress reconvenes after a 12-day break. On May 22, the last time we were here, this Chamber was involved in a 2-day marathon. H.R. 1, the misnamed one big, beautiful bill, was jammed through in the dead of the night, as it was being written in real time, by a vote of 215 to 214. During my time home, I held two townhalls. One was up in Tolland, Connecticut, near the border of Massachusetts. The other was down along the shoreline in Madison, Connecticut. Both townhalls were well- attended. Last night in Madison, it was standing room only. People were bursting with questions about how a bill that can change the tax code for the next 10 years, that can intervene in terms of our healthcare system, in terms of taking away people's health coverage, can happen with no transparency and no public input. As I said, it was being written in the dead of the night prior to the vote on May 22. This is what we know now as the dust has settled in terms of what the impact of this bill is. In terms of healthcare, the bill is going to cut our Medicaid program, America's largest healthcare program, and extract roughly $700 billion from the system over the next 10 years. The Affordable Care Act, subsidizes premiums, which provides health insurance for millions of Americans. Again, those premiums are going to be cut. As a result, people are going to lose their health insurance. That is not me saying that. That is the Congressional Budget Office, the neutral umpire that calls balls and strikes around this Congress who is saying that. Again, they have calculated that 15 million Americans will lose their health insurance as a result of this measure which was passed by the majority and jammed through in the dead of the night. In Connecticut, we have already seen what the numbers mean in terms of this bill. The Kaiser Family Foundation is not a partisan group. They have been studying healthcare trends and finance for decades. They determined that 140,000 citizens in the State of Connecticut will lose their health coverage as a result of this bill. As the dust has settled, we now know of one thing that didn't get a lot of attention. As a result of the deficit impact of this bill, which is going to add trillions of dollars to the national debt, it is going to trigger a sequestration, an automatic cut to the Medicare system. Medicare is the system that provides health insurance for people over 65 and people on disability. That is $500 billion over the next 10 years. Again, it is going to be a cut across the board to hospitals, to physicians, and to a whole series of medical devices and pharmacy products that are covered by Medicare. Again, this is because of the reckless deficit spending that this bill creates. That is not me saying that. The calculation of the Joint Committee on Taxation was $3.7 trillion of new debt on top of the $36 trillion of debt that we have today. The Wharton School of Finance, where President Trump attended school, calculated $3 trillion, as well. When they added the interest costs that are going to be paid on that additional deficit, that spending, that is going to push the number closer to $5 trillion. Again, today the deficit is $36 trillion. We are spending $89 billion a month in terms of interest costs on the existing debt. That is larger than what we spend in the Department of Defense on a monthly basis. It is bigger than any other account in the discretionary budget of this government. This bill accomplishes two harmful, damaging impacts to America which are, number one, 15 million people are going to lose their health insurance. We are also going to see the deficit grow by anywhere between $3 trillion and $5 trillion. For what? It is to reward the top 1 percent whose tax cuts are going to be extended and enlarged for many over the coming years, leaving working families and the poor in the dust. We can do better than this as a nation. Again, it is not too late to stop this. The Senate is now going to take up this bill. The external pressure is going to rise up with the American Hospital Association and with patient groups like the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, Autism Speaks, and people who represent disability groups. They are rising up now to stop this bill because of the harm it is going to cause on individuals and families all across this country. It is time to stop this one big, ugly bill that is going to do so much damage to the American people."
"Mr. Chair, I am aware of this issue. It is an important one. We are currently studying it and working with officials."
"In the first lines of her statement, the Secretary of State affirmed that this Government believe in equality. Where is the equality in evaluating one person's eligibility for the daily living component of PIP on the practical consequences of their disability, and evaluating another on the date of their application?"
"Mr. Speaker, I will get right to the question. I am sure the member understands that, whether it is nurses or doctors, we have to have the provinces on side. They are the ones that have to take down those barriers. It is one of the reasons we have to have the provinces involved. Would the member not agree that the provinces need to step up to the same degree—"
Order. The hon. opposition leader has a point of order.
"Mr. Speaker, the government will have a legal obligation to act in accordance with the purpose of the act and to expedite projects of national interest, while maintaining rigorous environmental standards and respecting the rights of indigenous peoples. Projects that will be subject to an impact assessment will be reviewed by existing regulatory agencies to identify the conditions necessary to protect Canadians and the environment. The designated minister must consult with other relevant ministers as well as provinces, territories and indigenous peoples to ensure that these conditions are sufficient."
"Mr. Speaker, as mentioned, on this side of the House, we are always for tax breaks, but is this really a serious tax break? Can we go further with it? The amount that has been quoted by the Liberals and some other studies, which is a lower amount, in my opinion is not enough. I talk to my constituents, and they have less for a coffee run or can only fill a quarter of their tank. That is not enough for Canadians. I would look to that side of the House to do more than just a small tax break."
"Mr. Chair, Bill C-2 makes progress in dealing with convicted offenders in part 13. Why does the bill not treat convicted fentanyl traffickers with the same depth of approach?"
"Mr. Speaker, I would hope that members opposite would be somewhat more respectful when members are speaking. At the end of the day, when the voters spoke on April 28, they sent a very strong message to all members of the House that the Prime Minister , the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, had a mandate to build one economy instead of the 13 that we currently have in the country, and that is what the legislation is all about. If we look at the election platform on page 1, if we look at the throne speech and if we look at the announcements made by the Prime Minister , we will see that the primary focus is to build one strong, healthy economy. The strongest economy in the G7 is the goal; that is something that the Prime Minister and Liberal members of Parliament are four-square behind. The focus of the government has been to enhance and build on that theme, and that is why we have Bill C-5 before us today, because the people of Canada were concerned about the economy, jobs and the direction that we were going in. There is a new Prime Minister and a new administration, with a focus on building our economy. When we think in terms of trade and in terms of opportunities, there is a special focus in regard to exploring ways in which we can trade with other countries around the world, expanding our opportunities. We have a Prime Minister who, just over two weeks ago, met with all the first ministers, all the premiers of provinces and territories across the country, about the idea of building the one Canadian economy. There have been provinces that have taken initiatives to build upon that. We have to be able to demonstrate here on the floor of the House of Commons that we are listening to what Canadians want and to their expectations. Their expectations are that there would be a high sense of co-operation, political parties aside, focused on what is in the best interest of Canadians, and that is exactly what our new Prime Minister has done. We met with first ministers of all political stripes. When meeting with indigenous leaders and with all the different stakeholders to date, the first priority has been Canadians and building our economy. That is what we are striving to do. Imagine April 28 to six or seven weeks later; look at what we have been able to accomplish in that very short period of time. We can talk about legislative measures, such as Bill C-5 , which we are talking about today, which in essence captures the one Canadian economy by looking at special projects and encouraging labour mobility, in law. We also have Bill C-2 , which is to strengthen our borders. It is a tangible investment, not only from a legislative perspective but also from a budgetary perspective, where we would commit to 1,000 more CBSA officers and 1,000 more RCMP officers. This would have a real impact on making our borders that much more secure, dealing with issues such as extortion and illegal immigration of different forms. These are the types of things—"
"Mr. Chair, I do not know how much time I have, but perhaps you would allow me. When numbers are set in those targets, I know, as a previous provincial minister—"
"I welcome the announcement of Plymouth's defence cluster and the national centre for marine autonomy. I am proud that much of this work is being done in my constituency at Turnchapel Wharf and soon at Langage in the Plymouth and South Devon freeport, and that it includes Smart Sound, all of which were supported by the last Conservative Government. Indeed, this did not really need a special name as it was already happening. The Chancellor's spending review speech initially included mention of PS4 billion for autonomous systems split between three locations including Plymouth yet, when checked against delivery, this element was missing. Please can the Minister clarify what funding is available for these autonomous systems' development in the strategy, in addition to the money announced for the submarine and continuous at sea deterrence programme at His Majesty's naval base Devonport?"
"I rise today to honor and celebrate a remarkable entrepreneur and her inspired business, Vintage 1945 Premium Cigars, founded and led by the truly exceptional Irene ``The Dream'' Loyde. Vintage 1945 Premium Cigars is more than just a business; it is a heartfelt tribute, thoughtfully named after her mother. Faye Anderson's birth year. This deeply personal connection speaks volumes about the passion and dedication that Ms. Loyde pours into every aspect of her venture. As the Owner and CEO. Irene ``The Dream'' Loyde has cultivated a brand that offers premium cigars, embodying quality, heritage, and a unique personal touch. She has been a national cigar industry entrepreneur since 2010, a testament to her resilience and perseverance in a male dominant industry. In an industry often dominated by large corporations, Ms. Loyde stands out as a visionary and successful independent business owner. Her leadership exemplifies the strength and resilience of entrepreneurs who bring their unique stories and craftsmanship to the marketplace. Vintage 1945 Premium Cigars not only provides a high-quality product but also contributes to the rich tapestry of small businesses that are the backbone of our economy and the heart of our communities. Irene ``The Dream'' Loyde's journey with Vintage 1945 Premium Cigars is an inspiration, showcasing how personal heritage can be transformed into a thriving enterprise. Her commitment to excellence and her ability to create a brand with such significant meaning are truly commendable. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating Irene ``The Dream'' Loyde on the success of Vintage 1945 Premium Cigars, for her entrepreneurial spirit, and her dedication to quality. I also ask that my colleagues congratulate her in building a business that continues her family legacy."
I call the shadow Secretary of State.
The hon. member for Calgary Heritage has the floor.
"Madam Speaker, it is difficult to say the bill is too big and not big enough at the same time. The Liberals are trying to strike that balance. I believe we need to work on legislation that addresses what we said we would do, which is sentence reform as well as bail reform."
"May I take this opportunity to thank my hon. Friend for all her leadership on this issue, and for bringing representatives of both Houses together last week to watch the very moving documentary with David Attenborough? That has had a profound impact on many Members across this House. She is absolutely right that we have to take action to ratify the treaty, and we are committed to bringing forward legislation before the end of the year--I hope it will be sooner. I am really pleased that the British Government have taken steps to ban bottom trawling in our protected marine waters."
"Madam Speaker, I am one of those people who waited for an electric vehicle during the pandemic, so I am very familiar with this situation. We need measures like this so that the vehicles people want to buy are actually available for purchase. Continuing to improve how these vehicles are produced in Canada is one way to accelerate the transition. What is clear is that people want these vehicles, and we must do everything we can to make them available."
If she will make a statement on her departmental responsibilities.
"Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister 's four weeks in Parliament were filled with broken Liberal promises: a broken promise on spending, a broken promise on tax cuts, a broken promise on consultants, a broken promise on defence and a broken promise on being elbows up with the U.S. Canada's fiscal watchdog confirmed a massive broken Liberal promise, the so-called tax cut. The Parliamentary Budget Officer reported that the average Canadian will save just $90 this year, or less than $7.50 a month. That is barely enough to buy a cup of coffee. Low-income seniors will see even less, only $50 a year, or under $5 a month. That is not relief; that is an insult. It is one thing for Liberals to promise relief but another to deliver pennies while families struggle. Canadians are concerned, and rightly so. They deserve a government that keeps its word and respects Canadians' wallets. Conservatives will deliver real tax relief for everyone, for good."
"I am trying to be tidy in the way I respond to people, so first, I note that I did not respond to the Napster point. Quite a lot of people have made the point to me that we got from Napster to Spotify. There are many problems with Spotify that many musicians, record labels and so on have raised with me, but at least it is better than people taking stuff for nothing. There is an argument--a strong argument, I would say--that in this debate, we want to move from Napster to Spotify, or to something even better than Spotify. I am not sure precisely how we get there, but I am absolutely certain that we need to legislate in the round for all of these issues. The hon. Member for Perth and Kinross-shire (Pete Wishart) asked me about the principles of the noble Baroness Kidron's amendment. Of course we believe in transparency--we are fully subscribed to wanting to provide that. That has always been part of the package that we have wanted to present. There is still the question of what enforcement would look like, and many other issues that any Bill that comes forward would need to address. I am hesitant about introducing a draft Bill, because a draft Bill would take longer to go through. We want to be able to legislate in this area as soon as we possibly can, but we also want to have listened to and borne in mind the full panoply of the responses.  People may presume that they know what the 11,500 responses will say, but actually, they are much more diverse. I am not saying that everybody is clamouring for what the Government have laid out; I am just saying that those responses address a diversity of issues, all of which we need to address."
"We have heard a lot about the failure of developers to build infrastructure, protect nature and provide enough social housing. Does that not just show that the status quo is broken, and why the Bill is so important and heading in the right direction?"
"Mr. Chair, 40 were built. Do you consider that a success?"
"Mr. Chair, during the pilot phase, several departments reported that the system was far from satisfactory. Why did the government continue to roll out the pay system despite the warnings and poor test results?"
"Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the member could elaborate. In rushing through Bill C-5 , not only does it, of course, violate indigenous rights, as we have heard, but what are the implications for the environment of overriding environmental standards?"
"Mr. Speaker, we are fighting these illegal and unjustified tariffs every day. They are hurting workers on both sides of the border, including Canadian workers and Canadian companies. The government will not be bullied. We are going to fight against these tariffs, defending every job and every business in Hamilton, in the Soo and across Canada."
"Mr. Speaker, we can all agree in this House that the integrity of our procurement processes is of utmost importance. Certainly, taxpayers are owed some answers. This company has been referred to the RCMP, and legal action is under way. We have also ensured that it can no longer enter into any contracts with the federal government for seven years."
"Mr. Chair, the minister is responsible for ensuring that those benefits are paid to people living with a disability. I would say those are the people in this country who are most vulnerable and are constantly being asked to wait by the government. The minister also spoke about the important role Canada will continue to play in the world and talked about defence spending. While the New Democrats are happy with the 2% defence spending announcement, I am very concerned about an 11% cut to spending on peace and security. How does he account for that?"
"Oh, oh!"
"My friend the hon. Lady--I hope she does not mind if I refer to her as a friend--is making a clear point. She has drawn attention to a great deal of confusion and misrepresentation in respect of what she is trying to achieve in her new clause, and she has shared some heartrending examples. However, she has just said something with which I think the whole House would agree. In recent years, we have seen our legislative approach to abortion effectively as placing ornaments on a legislative Christmas tree, tacking measures on to Bills in a very ad hoc way. I think she is actually right: this is a serious issue--I say this as a husband and as a father of three daughters--that requires serious consideration in a Public Bill Committee, with evidence from all sides and so on. Does she agree with me that, notwithstanding her laudable aims and heartfelt sincerity, it would be much better if these complex issues were dealt with in a free-standing Bill, rather than by amendment to a Crime and Policing Bill?"
"Mr. Speaker, I believe that the Prime Minister and the Government of Canada are sending a very strong message. That message is based on what we were hearing with regard to the last federal election, on April 28, which is that we have to build one Canadian economy. We have to deal with Donald Trump, the tariffs and the whole issue of trade. We have to look at ways in which we can expand our world trade opportunities. We have to protect wherever we can and enhance jobs. It does not matter whether it is in the province of Quebec, my home province of Manitoba or any other jurisdiction in Canada."
The hon. member.
indicated assent.
"I really recognise the point that the hon. Gentleman raises. Under the Conservatives, Bracknell Forest council saw bus miles per head fall from 10.9 to 6.3 miles--a reduction of 42 %. Only under a Labour council have routes now been expanded. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is vital that we work closely with bus companies through enhanced partnership models--if that is right for the local area, as it is in Bracknell Forest--to improve local services for our residents?"
"Mr. Speaker, one of the differences between the way we have handled the public policy issue versus the way the Conservatives have is that this government and this Prime Minister recognized that the policy of carbon pricing at the consumer level had become divisive and that there had to be a change. Instead of just cutting the consumer carbon price, we recognized there were rebates tied to the consumer price that went back to people and that eight out of 10 households were better off. However, it had become politically challenging, and the policy did not have the support of enough Canadians to be able to move forward. That is why we also introduced the tax cut I referenced in my speech, with up to $840 a year for two-income households in this country, or 22 million Canadians, as my hon. colleague from Winnipeg North has mentioned. That is the difference: We have removed that policy but also introduced a tax cut to make sure those households that were receiving a benefit from the rebate are better off and are continuing to be supported through tax measures that this government is introducing. The opposition members would have simply cut the program and made no mention of the fact that rebates were coming back. It was good to see them actually support this measure, because it is smart public policy."
"The battle of Bamber Bridge in my constituency, 82 years ago, was a powerful moment in history when local people stood in solidarity with black American soldiers against segregation. I am hugely grateful to councillors, like the wonderful Chris Lomax, who have worked so hard to keep the memory of this special moment in history alive. I know that the community will have a great time celebrating the anniversary this weekend with a proper American barbecue. Will the Leader of the House join me in wishing the Bamber Bridge community a wonderful celebration at the Ye Olde Hob Inn this weekend, and will she consider holding a debate on the long history of our British values of bravery and inclusion?"
All those opposed to the hon. member's moving the motion will please say nay. It is agreed. The House has heard the terms of the motion. All those opposed to the motion will please say nay. (Motion agreed to)
"as part of the California Third Congressional District Police Honor Roll and in honor of National Police Week 2025, I recognize Detective Dan Heaton of the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office for his unwavering commitment to serving and protecting the communities of Sacramento, California. Detective Heaton began his career with the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office in 2014. He spent 2 years in corrections before moving on to become a patrol officer. He eventually became a field training officer, where he was responsible for training new deputies under his watch. He was then assigned to the problem-oriented policing team, and then was promoted to his current rank of detective, being assigned to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. Throughout Detective Heaton's career and decade of public service, he has achieved a wide diversity of accomplishments to improve the safety of our communities. One accomplishment of particular note occurred last year, in which he led and implemented a proactive investigation across nine counties, including close to 30 agencies, that located and served warrants on more than 21 suspects who were preying on children. This was truly a heroic effort that spared many young lives from becoming victims. Detective Heaton is known by others for his strong leadership, innovative techniques, understanding of the law, and the high standards by which he holds himself and others. He makes himself available to assist other law enforcement officers and agencies, sharing the skills that he has worked so hard to develop. His passion and dedication to the protection of children is unparalleled, and his tireless efforts have made a meaningful impact in our communities. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent exemplary individuals like Detective Dan Heaton. On behalf of California's Third Congressional District and the United States House of Representatives, I thank and honor Detective Heaton for serving and protecting the region as a dedicated public servant.  Recognizing Police Officer Brett Schneider"
"Mr. Chair, that is an important question. The two levels of government jointly administer the temporary foreign worker program. Quebec controls more than 50% of the immigration for this type of worker, but we are here to work with Quebec, regardless."
Many constituents in Potters Bar have contacted me with concerns about increases in applications for houses of multiple occupation. Streets such as Strafford Gate are quiet residential roads with semi-detached bungalows. They are really not suitable for being converted into units with five or six bedrooms. Will the Leader of the House find time for us to debate whether planning rules in respect of houses of multiple occupation are fit for purpose?
"Mr. Chair, they are my friends too."
"In the time remaining, I will speak to amendment 9, which has been tabled by the hon. Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion) and is supported by many Members across the House, including myself. I welcome the Government's provisions to limit sex offenders' ability to change their name, and I know that many other Members also welcome them. I pay tribute to tireless campaigners such as Della Wright, who have campaigned for such provisions for many years and who I had the privilege of meeting at an event organised by Emma Jane Taylor, another tireless campaigner and a constituent of mine. Emma Jane is a survivor, and has spoken very bravely about the lifelong impact of child sexual abuse. Like many survivors, she has channelled her pain into campaigns such as this one and has set up a charity, Project 90-10. That charity is based on research showing that 90% of child sexual abuse is carried out by persons known to the victim. We are right in the House to focus--as we have in the past--on online abuse and abuse by strangers, but we should not forget that 90% of child sexual abuse is carried out by someone the victim knows. Work by Project 90-10 raises awareness of good safeguarding practices. Emma Jane brought to my attention the loophole that allows sex offenders to change their name and, potentially, continue to offend untraced. Amendment 9 would strengthen the name change provision in the Bill by requiring sex offenders to notify the police of their intention to change their name seven days before submitting an application to do so. Even if the Government do not adopt amendment 9, either here--I know that it will not be voted on--or in the other place, it is important for them to monitor the success of the changes that are in the Bill, and, in particular, the number of sex offenders who do, and do not, come forward to comply with the rules. I hope that the Government will monitor developments closely, and will introduce new legislation if the loophole is not closed, as they intend it to be. Child sexual abuse is a wicked and despicable crime, and the Government are right to introduce these measures, as well as the others about which Members have spoken so eloquently. I ask the Government to follow up on the Bill's implementation, and to monitor that extremely closely, as this matter is important to many Members of this House."
"The hon. Member and I served on the Bill Committee together. I think he misses a slightly important point that this is not about international alignment, as is put forward in the amendments tabled by the Opposition, but alignment with the EU, and that is why there is such concern from the Opposition parties."
"Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to work with and learn from my colleague from Hull—Aylmer. He is always eloquent and thoughtful. I am therefore very pleased to be part of the same team as he is and to work alongside him. I would like him to share his perspective on our ambitious plan to make life more affordable. What impact is that having on his riding?"
"it is a privilege to rise and recognize five outstanding young leaders from eastern North Carolina who have earned appointments to our Nation's service academies. Abel Dees and Parker Stokes are headed to the United States Military Academy. Leo Fletcher-Fontana will attend the United States Air Force Academy. Nicholas Santiago and Dylan Sawyer are bound for the United States Naval Academy. These remarkable young leaders have achieved academic excellence. They reflect the best of our communities and are answering the call that goes way beyond themselves. Behind each of them is a community of supporters and families whose love is making it possible for them. Mr. Speaker, to our appointees: Abel, Parker, Leo, Nicholas, and Dylan, eastern North Carolina believes in them and we are proud of them."
"Edgar ``Pete'' Peters has been a dedicated and hardworking operations agent with Southwest Airlines for the past 27 years. In 1998, the young Army veteran joined Southwest Airlines as a ramp agent in Baltimore, Maryland. He later accepted his current position and transferred to the Southwest Airlines operations in Orlando, Florida. Pete has worked in many capacities over the years, including as a member of the Safety and Emergency Care team, a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion representative, and as a training coordinator. He has been awarded many honors, including Operations Agent of the Quarter on several occasions and Operations Agent of the Year. His passion for helping others and giving back to the community has led him to create The Ann Hewan Foundation, which contributes to his native Jamaica from his Lake Nona community in Central Florida. Pete, as he is known throughout the area and community, is heavily involved in charity work that supports underprivileged children. Each year, Pete collects, solicits, purchases, and ships back-to-school items, such as notebooks, pencils, backpacks, restored computers, and clothing items, to Jamaica, where he partners with a local school and charity in the community. Throughout the school year, he collects and donates some of his own money to help support the Goodwill Infant and Primary School Breakfast Program, which now operates three days a week, providing breakfast to underprivileged children at school who are unable to get it at home. Pete's current project is assisting a local community charity in building a proper playing field for the kids at the Goodwill Primary and Infant School, which is almost 50% complete. The playing field will be used for recreational purposes and extracurricular activities, bringing joy and a sense of pride to the children and the community upon completion. Pete also helps out and supports local charity events around Central Florida communities and around the Southwest Airlines system. Pete's dedication and low-key approach are what keep him going. As the son of Pinkie Hewan, who migrated to the United States in search of a better life, Pete's passion and understanding create the high octane for helping others and treating them with respect."
I thank the hon. Member for raising this important project. I can confirm that works at Angel Hill free school are expected to commence in September 2025 subject to the contract being awarded in August.
"Madam Chair, does he not know how much it is going to cost? It was estimated at $647 million. That is the Liberal number, but Canada has 2.3 million firearms owners, who own five firearms on average. If we do the simple math and buy back just one for around $800 to $1,000, we are talking about several billion dollars. Does the minister think that investing several billion dollars could do more to help the police than hurt farmers and hunters?"
"This is just a reminder to use titles and not members' proper names. Resuming debate, the hon. member for Calgary Nose Hill."
"I thank the member for his intervention and for communicating this information to the Chair. I will take this information under advisement and come back to the House with my ruling later today. Returning to the debate, the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader has the floor."
"Will the Solicitor General outline what support there is for the families of domestic abuse victims--specifically children who have witnessed and been traumatised by that abuse and who need support, which would also enable their parents to feel more confident in continuing their legal cases?"
"The most recent data, from 2023, showed that 25% of manufacturing jobs in Stoke-on-Trent were in ceramics. Ceramics--especially advanced ceramics--is critical to strategic industries such as defence, nuclear energy and steel. Does my hon. Friend agree that the industrial strategy must recognise the foundational industry of ceramics, which is vital for the future not only of Stoke-on-Trent but the country?"
"I give the right hon. Gentleman my assurance, because this is a very important issue, that we are working at pace with our allies on that very issue, to take whatever measures we can to get that humanitarian aid in. We have been doing that intensively over recent weeks and I give him my assurance that we  will continue to do that, because that aid needs to get in at speed and at volume, and he is absolutely right about that."
"Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge that I stood with my colleague this week as we urged the government to provide honorary citizenship for Jimmy Lai. I appreciate his work on that. It is unfortunate that has not happened yet. The government has announced huge expenditures in defence spending. One of the things I worry about is that this is ultimately a procurement issue, and I am concerned about whether he trusts the government—"
From Alberta.
"Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand in this place and speak to the Speech from the Throne. As this is the first time I am rising in this Parliament, I would like to take a moment to express my gratitude to the voters in Carlton Trail—Eagle Creek for once again putting their faith in me to be their representative here in Ottawa. It is truly an honour, one that I take very seriously. No one gets here on their own, and I want to thank my team and the volunteers who showed up day after day during the campaign. Lastly, I want to thank my husband, Milton, and my entire family, who have stood by me and behind me every step of the way. I also want to acknowledge all those individuals displaced as a result of the fires in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as well as all those fighting hard to ensure those communities remain safe. The people in my riding and, indeed, Saskatchewan, overwhelmingly voted for hope and change. They understood that our country would not thrive under more of the same failed Liberal policies. While the Prime Minister promised change, a different Liberal government and a more serious approach, we are not off to a good start. As it turns out, things are not so different after all, starting with the Prime Minister naming Trudeau's foremost ministers to the most senior roles in his cabinet. Immediately after their swearing-in, his ministers made statements refuting the various policies he had run on. For example, the Minister of Canadian Identity and Culture claimed that no pipelines will be built, and the housing minister stated that he intends to make sure housing prices do not come down. It is not a good sign that while Canadians are struggling with affordability and businesses face uncertainty, Liberal ministers want to suppress the country's largest industry and keep young Canadians priced out of the housing market. Members will remember when the Prime Minister said during the election campaign, “a plan beats no plan.” Canadians were rightly expecting to see that plan put forward in the Speech from the Throne, followed by a budget. However, with the campaign behind him, the Prime Minister announced he is waiting until the fall, pushing off the plan, as well as the accountability that comes through the scrutiny of a government's budget. Instead we are left with a throne speech full of half measures, no budget and main estimates that include more spending than under Trudeau, with an 8% increase. During the election, the Prime Minister said that despite being an economic adviser to Trudeau, he would be different; he would reorient the government to be more fiscally responsible. The throne speech stated, “In all of its actions, the Government will be guided by a new fiscal discipline: spend less so Canadians can [save] more.” However, no sooner did the promise of fiscal responsibility pass his lips than it is already being broken. Now we see that the spending of the Trudeau years will carry on under the current Prime Minister. The main estimates were released last week, with the government asking to spend nearly half a trillion dollars in its first spending bill. How can the Liberals keep a straight face in claiming to be fiscally responsible while supporting a spending bill that even outstrips Trudeau’s spending from last year? Within this half-trillion dollar ask, the government has earmarked $26 billion in spending on consultants. That is an 11% increase in spending on those consultants. In the last Parliament, Conservatives uncovered what the Liberals paid for: consultants who had padded their pockets through double-dipping, fraudulent billing and, at the end of it all, subpar work that could have been done in-house by the public service. Perhaps the additional billions in spending is due to the new list of Liberal insiders that the new Prime Minister brings with him from his previous career. In the arrive scam scandal, a consulting firm billed tens of millions of dollars to build a simple app but did none of the work, work that some programmers were able to replicate over a weekend. Roughly $60 million is known to have been spent on this app; the number may be even higher, but, because shoddy documentation was kept, the Auditor General could not confirm it, so we will never know. We also found out that McKinsey, a favourite consulting firm of the Liberals, was given preferential treatment, leading to $100 million in government contracts. The Liberals used a contract vehicle called a national master standing offer, which is usually reserved for vendors who offer a specialized service that government departments need access to. When the Auditor General reviewed these contracts, she found that McKinsey should not have been given special access to the government contracts. In the throne speech, the Prime Minister also promised to work with indigenous peoples to identify and catalyze projects of national significance. Given the Liberal government's track record on indigenous procurement, I believe this will be another empty promise. While studying the procurement strategy for indigenous businesses, the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates found that the government was not verifying the indigeneity of businesses. During testimony, indigenous groups and businesses suggested that most of the funding through this program was going to non-indigenous businesses that were posing as indigenous. The Liberals allowed this abuse by ignoring the rules and a lack of indigenous leadership and/or ownership while handing out millions of dollars in contracts. The government was unable to offer any explanation for its failure to ensure that programs meant to benefit indigenous peoples and businesses did so. Although this study was cut short when the election was called, the issues persist and must be addressed, especially if the government intends to fast-track major projects across the country. This leads us to the promise in the speech to create a “new Major Federal Project Office”. Imitation is truly the best form of flattery. In 2007, the Harper government created the Major Projects Management Office. The goal of the office at that time was to improve coordination within Canada's regulatory system by providing industry with a single, efficient point of entry into the federal process. It also provided for the integration of Crown consultation requirements with indigenous communities at the beginning of the process. This further demonstrated the Harper government's commitment to consulting with and listening to Canadians, especially those most directly affected by resource development projects, all while upholding Canada's world-class environmental standards. Does this sound familiar? However, the last 10 years of an antidevelopment Liberal government has made Canada dependent on and vulnerable to the U.S. Without a commitment to scrap the production cap on Canadians, to repeal Bill C-69 and Bill C-48 , and to axe the federal industrial carbon tax, this proposal is just another empty promise. In closing, the promises made in the Speech from the Throne do not line up with Liberals' actions. While promising to enact more fiscal discipline, they are increasing spending. While promising to define a new relationship with the United States, they are dropping retaliatory tariffs and allowing the U.S. to take jobs out of Canada. While promising to make Canada an energy superpower, Liberal ministers insist that pipelines should not be built and that Canada's oil and gas should stay in the ground. While the Prime Minister promised to bring housing costs down, his housing minister intends to keep house prices up, at record highs. The Liberals are already going back on their word within the first days of this session. Unfortunately for Canadians, the so-called new Liberal government looks a lot like the old one. After 10 years of high spending leading to inflation and an affordability crisis, Canadians want fiscal restraint and a government that will be responsible with their tax dollars. Canadians can count on Conservatives to fulfill our duty every day to stand up for them, fight for change and restore hope once again."
"Mr. Speaker, there have been 10 femicides in Quebec since the beginning of the year. At one point, there were five in five weeks. Yesterday, a woman was killed in Vaudreuil-Dorion. She was in a toxic and violent relationship. Did the system let her down, as it has many other women before her? When will the Prime Minister correct the mistakes made by his predecessor, Mr. Trudeau, which contributed to leaving these women unprotected?"
"Mr. Chair, will the Government of Canada continue its $30-million subsidy of BC Ferries?"
"I congratulate my hon. Friend on working so positively with the Mayor of West Yorkshire to secure this historic amount of investment in her community. She asked specifically if there will be new bus stations as part of the announcement. I understand from Tracy Brabin that there will be new bus stations at Bradford and Wakefield, as well as building out the West Yorkshire mass transit system. I understand from the numbers that there is still some more to spend, and I am sure that my hon. Friend will be in touch with the mayor about that in due course."
"First of all, I am sorry to hear about that. Hard-working businesspeople who spend a lot of their time building up a business should expect the full force of the law to protect their property and their interests. Also, while I have the opportunity, can I congratulate the hon. Member on running Hamble Valley's very first pub competition this year? I hope that I will get an invite. He is absolutely right that we have to have increased police numbers and ensure that they are responsive to people's concerns. We are doing that; his Government let people down."
"Mr. Chair, that is another great question. Our ports are quite literally our access to the world. They are so important. Just a few weeks ago, I was so pleased to be in Halifax to meet with the great people who run that port and to hear about their ambitious plans to make a wonderful port even better. I was very pleased a few days ago to meet with the leadership of the Port of Vancouver. Their Roberts Bank terminal 2 project is a very important project for our country, and I am very excited, as minister, to be working with them and to be supporting them. I also want to point again to the very important meeting the Prime Minister held with the premiers of the provinces and territories. An important subject of discussion was building Canada and putting forward major projects in the national interest, which included many projects to build up our ports, to build our roads, to build our trade corridors and to build our railways. This is a time for us to get to work. We need to work hard to make the Canadian economy the strongest economy in the G7 and to diversify at a time when we are facing a real threat from the United States."
"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General's investigation into the Liberals' purchase of the F-35 fighter jets is deeply concerning. Costs have ballooned by more than 50%, and delivery is behind schedule, but it gets worse: The facilities to house the jets will not be completed until 2031. That is three years too late, and taxpayers will be left spending even more money on temporary hangars. The investigation also confirmed that we do not have enough pilots. How does the Liberal government expect the planes to fly without pilots? In fact, the Liberals have flip-flopped. First, they opposed the F-35 program, then they supported it, then they sent it to review, and so on. After the lost Liberal decade, Canadians are feeling anxious in an increasingly dangerous world. Out-of-control costs, repeated construction delays and lack of staff threatened to delay the replacement of the fighter jets. Now the Liberals want billions of dollars to waste. The government promised change, but it is more of the same. Under the Liberals, Canadians have never paid so much for getting so little in return."
"Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives agree to apply the vote, with Conservatives voting against."
"Absolutely, Spain does recognise the sovereignty of Gibraltar and its relationship with the United Kingdom in the agreement, and the right hon. Gentleman will see that detail in the treaty. He will know that the subject of dispute over many, many years--long before many of us were in this House--is over the isthmus. Much of the territory that some would describe as neutral--others have different descriptions--exists between Gibraltar and Spain. Overwhelmingly, there has been support for reaching this moment on both sides. I cannot comment on the extremities of politics in Spain, but I am sure that these days that can be looked up on social media."
What steps he is taking to improve relations with the EU.
"Mr. Speaker, they come from Alberta and other provinces; that is correct. When we look at federal programs, we see that federal programs' monies do not always flow equally to every single province. They flow directly to different things in different programs. We would imagine, in the end, that the country is made better as a whole by all the programs we have. The idea that we would take each and every program and allot the amount equally by province would, in the end, actually hurt Quebec. It would, in the end, actually take monies away from Quebec, not give monies to Quebec. I do not understand the logic of the Bloc Québécois, which is insisting that, in this one particular case, we have to allot all of the monies equally by province, when that is not the opinion of the Bloc Québécois when it comes to many, many other programs. I also find it a bit odd that the Bloc Québécois thinks it is wrong that Quebec decided to have its own program. We respect Quebec's autonomy. Quebec has its own program and British Columbia has its own program. The rest of the country had a different program. I would have thought that the Bloc Québécois would be very happy that flexible federalism allows Quebec to have its own program. Saying that the model used by the other provinces should also apply to Quebec, when Quebec has its own model, is completely contradictory to the general position of the Bloc Québécois, which wants absolute autonomy for Quebec. I am happy that the new government removed the carbon tax as one of its first acts, the federal backstop, leaving the flexibility for each province to handle that the way it wants to handle it. That does not mean we are not going to invest in the economy. It does not mean we are not going to invest in clean technology. It does not mean we are not investing in the environment. However, there also has to be a general consensus on what happens. I am also very pleased that the government, at the same time, announced the removal of the capital gains inclusion rate changes, which I had not agreed with. I think that was a very good step. I think all the steps the government has taken by lowering income taxes on Canadians, building one national economy where free trade applies across the country within federal jurisdiction and asking the provinces to do the same, allowing for big national projects to be built, and allowing our energy and resources to go to market are bringing the government to the centre, which I think most Canadians want. I think there is a willingness to work with the other political parties joining us in the centre to govern the country and make Canada's economy the best in the G7. We now have a real opportunity to do things differently than in the last Parliament, when we were always fighting and squabbling. We can work together to build a stronger Canada, a Canada where Alberta oil can make it to market and can get to tidewater. We can have a Canada where big national projects get built in a fast time frame. We can have a Canada that respects provincial autonomy but understands that there are big national projects and national goals to fulfill. We can have a Canada where we all understand that in a changing world, where we are faced with a lot of challenges, we have to work together as a country. Whether we are Conservatives, Liberals, Bloc members or New Democrats, we have to work together as a country. If I come back to the Bloc motion, it did not look at things, at least originally, from the perspective of the country. It looked at things from the perspective of one province only, even though other provinces and one territory were not part of the initial system. Nobody even considered them when it came to the motion. That is not how we should be looking at things. There has to be some logical coherence. For my first speech in this Parliament, I am pleased to reach out to my opposition colleagues and tell them that I look forward to working with them on all our country's major issues and on various matters. We are here to stand together and build a better Canada."
"I am here to join my colleagues--with thanks to them, most especially to Senator Durbin--to highlight the impact of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which for the last 13 years has benefited countless young people who have come to this country as infants or young children, brought by their parents before they could even speak any language, some of them, and many of them here knowing only English, only the neighborhoods where they live now, only this country as their home. DACA has offered safety, security, and hope to thousands of people, including 3,000 active DACA recipients living in Connecticut alone. They are our friends and neighbors. They are students, nurses. They have all kinds of jobs that are important to our community and our State in Connecticut. They are key members of communities, having lived in the United States for an average of 26 years--that is right, 26 years on average. Ninety-one percent of DACA recipients in Connecticut participate in the Connecticut labor force. Mr. President, 92 percent of DACA recipients have a high school diploma, and 81 percent have some college education. In Connecticut, 30 percent of DACA recipients are married, 17 percent have children, and there are 6,000 U.S. citizens living with DACA recipients. Let me tell you the stories of two DACA recipients in Connecticut. Agnes was brought to Connecticut when she was 9 years old. She worked hard in school and qualified for a Rotary Club scholarship to attend Western Connecticut State University. Because of DACA, she was able to obtain work authorization and get a job upon graduating college. She says DACA eliminated the uncertainty she felt as a child and allowed her to pursue opportunities she otherwise would not have. She is now a U.S. citizen, married, with two beautiful boys. She owns a home. She manages a global team at a commodity trading company in Connecticut. Another DACA recipient who also came to the United States when she was 9 years old said DACA was ``monumental.'' It gave her a sense of independence. It allowed her to build a future for herself that she wanted and aspired to have. She can't imagine what her life would have been like without it. In 2009, before she graduated from college, she learned about the DREAMAct and was inspired to pursue advocacy work. She is now part of an organization in Connecticut called Connecticut Students for a Dream, working to help other Dreamers like her. Through her advocacy, she pushed for the passage of legislation in Connecticut that provided instate tuition access, institutional financial aid, and a college access program for undocumented students. Finally, after receiving DACA, she obtained her work authorization. She got a job overseeing a leadership program for Connecticut high school students. These two remarkable stories are just two examples of the extraordinary impact that DACA recipients have on our community. Last December, President Trump said:  We have to do something about the Dreamers.  He said:  We have to do something about the Dreamers. Republicans are very open to Dreamers.  I call on the administration to resume processing initial DACA applications outside of Texas, in line with the ruling from the Fifth Circuit. I call on this administration to do the right thing, to do what is legally open, what history encourages us to do. The history of this program shows the human potential of DACA recipients. I encourage my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to come together with more permanent legislation for Dreamers. They give back. They contribute to our communities. They work tirelessly to do better. We owe them better. These Dreamers deserve to build a future in this country with the security and safety of permanent status and a path to citizenship. I yield the floor."
"Since the second world war, our national security has been based broadly on three pillars: our physical defences, which the Prime Minister mentioned in his statement; the alliances that we have built, which he also mentioned; and the international rules-based order, which he did not mention. What discussion did he have at either summit about the importance of international law, and the undermining of its credibility through the inconsistent way that it has been applied in the conflicts in Ukraine and in Gaza? In particular, did he try to persuade President Trump to lift the United States sanctions on the International Criminal Court?"
"Madam Speaker, after the Liberals' Bill C-69 cancelled a dozen pipeline projects in Canada, Germany, Japan, Greece, Poland, Latvia, Ukraine, South Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan all pleaded with Canada for our LNG. Now, in the middle of a jobs crisis, the promise of an energy superpower and the world wanting our energy, we could use Canadian steel and Canadian labour to build Canadian pipelines to get Canadian energy to the world. How many new pipelines can we expect to be operational in the next two years?"
"Mr. Speaker, as of yesterday, U.S. tariffs on aluminum and steel have doubled to 50%. After three months of this dispute, time is running out for our industries. However, after three months, they have yet to receive any support. The Prime Minister says he is in intensive discussions with the Americans, which is good. However, after three months, the government should no longer be at the intensive discussion stage. It should be at the intensive action stage. Our industries need liquidity and wage subsidies. After three months of inaction, will the Prime Minister finally protect our workers and industries?"
"Mr. Chair, as soon as we get the one Canadian economy act done and the agreements negotiated with the Province of Ontario, we will get them done as quickly as possible."
"Madam Speaker, I would first like to congratulate my colleague on his arrival in the House and his election. I will note that over the past 10 years, though, his party has voted against every affordability measure, whether it be tax cuts for the middle class, the Canada child benefit, the dental care program or more child care spaces in Quebec. The Conservatives have now gotten off on the right foot by supporting us with a measure to lower taxes for 22 million Canadians, as well as eliminate the GST on new builds, which will directly help first-time buyers become home owners. I hope they will keep going and support us with estimates that fund essential programs for my colleague's constituents in Beauce."
Matching the Scottish child payment by raising the child element of universal credit would bring more than half a million children out of poverty. The Secretary of State has been clear that a lot of issues are being considered by the child poverty taskforce. Is raising the child element of universal credit to the level of the Scottish child payment one of those matters?
"Mr. Chair, it is a pleasure to answer that question. The member will know, as we have been public about this, that we have collected $1.7 billion so far in countertariffs in Canada—"
"The hon. Member makes a wonderful point about the fact that early intervention is underfunded, but such funding actually reaps huge benefits for students. I should declare that I worked at the Centre for Social Justice, where we looked at early intervention as one of the most important ways of turning around the lives of children. Especially for children with special educational needs, early diagnosis and early intervention can make all the difference in their not falling behind when they enter main education. It is rare that I support additional funding, but I do for early intervention because it is life-changing. The years during which we can change a child's life are those from four to seven. It is such a small window during which we can erase trauma and help with any disability, but that will help them for the rest of their lives, so early intervention makes all the difference for such children in the long term. I ask the Government to listen: to listen to the children, families and schools telling them that SEND funding is not making it to the children who need it; to listen to the local authorities that need clarity urgently on the future of high-needs blocks and the statutory override; to listen to the parents of children at independent schools who are being ripped from settings that work for them because of an Education Secretary who will  not listen to the evidence that those schools are the right place for those students at this time; and to listen to the primary schools that are now short of teachers, but are trying to provide SEND support for these children at the most vital stage of their education. It is time for the Government to listen and to make the changes our children with SEND so desperately need."
"I recognise my hon. Friend's point, and I will of course meet with him and his SMEs. Over the last six months, the Defence Secretary and I have convened stakeholders from industry and finance to discuss this issue and make it clear that defence is an ethical sector that they should support. The strategic defence review committed us to developing a dedicated financial services sector strategy, which we will aim to publish in spring 2026. That should give us a further opportunity to make sure that the finance industries know what a good investment defence can be."
"Mr. Speaker, the government use of contractors and overspending problem is nothing new. It is even a growing problem. After all, the Auditor General mentions $18 million being paid to private companies for IT services. Quebec is currently holding a public inquiry on the SAAQclic fiasco. This project went about $500 million over budget. When we compare the two situations, we see that Ottawa can go billions over budget and no one says a word. There is a motion on the floor today, but we need to remember that Ottawa provides hardly any services itself, aside from passports, which it has a hard time delivering. Rather than having Ottawa invest more and more and take Canadians to the cleaners, what does the member think of the idea of Ottawa tackling the fiscal imbalance and sending money and taxes into the coffers—"
"The Minister seems unable to say sorry, but does he at least regret that more than 90,000 more elderly people went to A&E last winter than did the year before, in the last winter under the Conservative Government?"
I welcome the Foreign Secretary's statement. The Iranian regime is a malignant international force--who knows how many British lives have been lost to its sponsorship of international terrorism. The Iranians have explicitly stated a threat towards our assets and our people in the middle east. How much confidence does the Foreign Secretary have in our ability to mitigate those threats?
"Mr. Chair, congratulations on your post. I know that you are from southwestern Ontario as well. It is an honour to rise as the member for London North Centre and also as the newly appointed parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship ."
"Madam Speaker, during the election, no one promised a government whose first priority would be to rub shoulders with oil and gas companies, to work on creating new pipelines and to invite the King. It seems to me that this government has strange priorities. No one told us the government would take the Conservative Party's platform and implement it. That is what Quebeckers voted against. I also think that is part of what Canadians voted against."
"moved, seconded by the member for Courtenay—Alberni: That Bill C-5, in Clause 4, be amended by adding after line 15 on page 19 the following: “(m.1) the Species at Risk Act;”"
"The Government are committed to introducing the most ambitious programme of animal welfare in a generation. I am not aware of the particular regulation that the right hon. Gentleman mentions, but I will ensure that he gets a full response from the Minister and that it is made available for everybody else."
"Mr. Speaker, I doubt the hon. member my colleague is referring to who made the comment actually read the bill, because he has not. This is what the bill says. As my colleague across the way mentioned, there are some provisions, although not that one, that could ostensibly, maybe, help fix the mess that the Liberals created themselves. However, there are some things in there so egregious that I think the Liberals put them in there specifically as a poison pill. That means they are not serious about solving these issues and want them to continue. If the Liberals were serious about addressing these issues, they would not have put, as they did in Bill C-63 , poison pill civil liberties issues in there to bottleneck Parliament. I encourage all colleagues in this place to go to the minister and say that this is a dog's breakfast. Let us figure this out."
"10 years ago today, our Nation made a remarkable step toward equality with the legalization of gay marriage. This was a day that came after decades of advocacy by individuals and organizations across the country, including Garden State Equality in my home State of New Jersey. The rights of our friends and neighbors are under continuous attack from the Trump administration including by cutting HIV treatment and prevention and rolling back antidiscrimination protections. More than 1.3 million Americans have sought lifesaving help by making the call to 988. Yet this administration has eliminated funding for those specialized services. These are blatant attempts to harm the LGBTQ community that has already overcome so much and made incredible strides towards equality. It is here in this Chamber that we should be standing beside them and fighting for them. When we are elected here to serve here in the people's House, it is our obligation to fight for everyone that we have the privilege of representing. Mr. Speaker, that is what I will always do and what I urge my colleagues across the aisle to do, as well."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise to table a petition on behalf of Vancouver East constituents who took part in the peace train journey to Ottawa to promote a culture of peace and resist the culture of war. The petitioners note that Canada is a signatory to the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and Canada's adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples further reflects our commitment to the principles of justice, equality and freedom. They note that these principles are essential to peace, to preventing conflict and war, and for Canada's own security and stability. They also note that a lack of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms is a chief underlying cause of violent conflict. In the face of ever-increasing violent wars, nuclear threat, climate disruption and humanitarian crises, the signatories call upon the House of Commons in Parliament assembled to establish and fund a centre of excellence for peace and justice focused on research, education and training in conflict resolution, diplomacy and peace operations for Canadian civilians, police, military personnel and the international community."
"In my Oxfordshire constituency of Didcot and Wantage, sites at Culham, Harwell campus and Milton Park host a growing range of scientific and high-tech businesses, including a proposed artificial intelligence growth zone at Culham. Major housing growth also continues, and the new Valley Park development will use air source heat pumps. However, the Future Oxfordshire Partnership has raised concerns that grid constraints are causing significant delays to decarbonisation activities and creation of local power grids. What steps will the Minister take to address these problems and create an electricity grid fit for 21st-century Oxfordshire?"
"Crawley is home to the Tinsley House and Brook House immigration removal centres, and their associated scandal. What consideration is being given to the Home Affairs Committee's inquiry into immigration detention, including ending the use of such centres for indefinite detention?"
"Before we go to resuming debate, it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for Leeds—Grenville—Thousand Islands—Rideau Lakes, Ethics; the hon. member for Newmarket—Aurora, Finance; the hon. member for Elgin—St. Thomas—London South, Natural Resources."
"Mr. Speaker, it must be said that rarely is the sequel better than the original, but the member will have an opportunity to prove the opposite. We are particularly grateful to the opposition and, through my hon. colleague, his caucus. I thank them for adopting a great throne speech that sketches out a very clear and bold agenda for fixing the Canadian economy and taking on the tariffs. It must be said that steel and aluminum producers are far more concerned about tariffs, and the Prime Minister is singularly committed to addressing the tariff challenge the United States has put to us. We will have tributes today to a former colleague, friend and member of this House. After the round of tributes, we will resume debate at second reading of Bill C-2 , which contains measures relating to border security between Canada and the United States. Pursuant to the order made by the House last week, we will debate the estimates in committee of the whole later this evening, as well as next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, as I said in my previous Thursday statement. Tomorrow morning, we will begin debate on the bill introduced earlier today regarding affordability measures for Canadians. Lastly, next Monday and Tuesday will be allotted days."
"The state has to reform to secure better value for money and outcomes for the public, and to ensure that government better reflects the country it serves. I often say that I want a civil service that speaks with all the accents of this great country. We are committed to half of UK-based senior civil servants being based outside London by the end of the decade. Last month, we confirmed plans to relocate thousands of civil service roles to 13 towns and cities across the country. The aim is to bring the civil service closer to local communities and to bring good employment prospects to different parts of the country."
"Mr. Speaker, the Fisheries Act, the Indian Act, the International River Improvements Act, the Canadian Navigable Waters Act, biodiversity acts and regulations, the Official Languages Act, the Income Tax Act and the Canada Labour Code are all acts and regulations that the minister would be allowed to suspend arbitrarily thanks to Bill C‑5 . At the very least, does not the entire framework for regulating economic activity in Quebec and Canada deserve thorough study in committee?"
"Mr. Speaker, I want to join the hon. member from the Sault in welcoming some of the most important unions and skilled trades to Ottawa today. These unions represent over one million good-paying jobs. Our one Canadian economy plan will fast-track major projects so we can build across this country, brick by brick, with good Canadian steel and aluminum. It is time to build big, build bold and build now. Canada's building trades will get it done, and this government will always have their backs."
The hon. member.
"Madam Chair, I would first like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who works at the Canada Revenue Agency, particularly those in Shawinigan, in my riding. I can tell you that each and every one of them strives to deliver the best possible service to Canadians. We are looking closely at the concerns raised by my colleague."
"I am really sorry to hear that Neil Stewart took his own life, with the impact that must have had, and is still having, on his family and friends. To hear of their extraordinary fundraising efforts for  RSABI is heartwarming. Mental health and mental health support, whether in rural communities, young people and other aspects, are a priority for the Government, and more will be announced shortly in the 10-year plan."
"I recently visited the Huntingdon branch of Barclays bank in my rural constituency, where staff highlighted to me that although the Crime and Policing Bill will make assaulting a shop worker an offence, branch staff in banks and building societies are not included in that classification, despite the fact that they work on the high street and are subject to the same threats and intimidation as shop workers. There were over 10,000 instances of abuse in branches last year. What rationale can the Minister provide for excluding branch staff in banks and building societies from the protections given to retail staff, who work next to them?"
"Madam Speaker, the single biggest threat to Canada's auto sector, or to Canada in general, is American tariffs, not electric vehicles. We are fighting to protect Canadian jobs and are building an electric vehicle supply chain that is driving record investment into our economy. Transportation emissions have declined to levels that have not been seen in decades, demonstrating that we can grow our economy while also fighting climate change. That is what I would say."
"Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Auditor General for her report. As I mentioned earlier, the office of supplier integrity rendered a decision last week making GC Strategies ineligible for future contracts from the Government of Canada."
"Madam Chair, I am very proud of that. I am a proud Quebecker, and I am pleased to see that Quebeckers have chosen electric vehicles. That is why we will continue to invest in the battery industry."
"Democratic Senators have been on the floor for hours today pointing out what is in this thousand-page bill that took over 16 hours to read. I call it the thousand pages of pain and the billionaires' gain. It is bad enough that my colleagues have been on the floor talking about how this bill is going to hurt people on Medicaid, taking food away from our children and families through major cuts to the SNAP program--healthcare, food, housing, energy support, you name it, the pain is in this bill--but one of the areas that people don't know about is that this bill actually has provisions that would take away support for our public schools. Let that sink in. It is not enough that this bill has a thousand pages of pain in just about every aspect of our lives that you can think of, but now they are coming after support for our public schools. So today, I am rising as an advocate for the 49 million children who are enrolled in public schools across our country. Nearly 90 percent of K through 12 students go to public schools, including 95 percent of children with disabilities. Yet we have a regime that is actively working to end Federal support for public schools. We have a President who tried to totally eliminate the Department of Education, and, sadly for him, he can't do it through Executive order because only Congress can do that. But they are doing a lot of other things that withhold support for public schools. So, as you know, Republicans in Congress are trying to undermine support for public schools through the first-ever national private school voucher program. Let that sink in--the first-ever national private school voucher program. That is taking money away from public schools and basically turning it over to private schools through a voucher program. So let's be clear. The school voucher program provision isn't about money for schools; it is about even more money for billionaires because they are the folks who are going to get the most out of this voucher for private schools program. Under this program, wealthy donors would receive large handouts for supporting school vouchers. This is a Washington Post headline:  GOP voucher plan would divert billions--  Four billion a year--  in taxes in perpetuity to private schools.  So, specifically, the plan would provide a dollar-for-dollar tax credit. We are not talking about tax deductions; we are talking about a tax credit. This is money that comes right off your taxable amount. So what this bill would do is provide a tax credit of $5,000 or 10 percent of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income, whichever is greater. So a taxpayer making $10 million--we do have people who make $10 million a year--could contribute $1 million and receive a credit for that full amount. How do you like that? You can get a million dollars off your tax bill by contributing to this private school voucher program. So rather than calling this plan what it is--and I tell you, the word ``scam'' comes to my mind; it is like scamming the public schools-- Republicans are deceitfully trying to sell this plan as an expansion of school choice for families. Oh, isn't this voucher program great? More families can send their kids to private school. Here is the reality: Based on what we know about school voucher programs, they do not promote school choice. Let me give you two examples of why this argument does not hold water. For one thing, school vouchers do not cover the full cost of private school tuition. When was the last time anybody thought about how much private schools cost? You know, schools in Hawaii--private schools can cost something on the order of $15 to $20,000 a year, starting from kindergarten. A voucher program will not support that full amount. That means that families who want to send their kids to these private schools will have to make up the cost difference. Well, how many middle-income, low- income families will be able to exercise that choice to send their child to a private school that costs that much? Not only that, as we have seen in States that have passed voucher programs, private schools often raise their tuition when they become eligible for vouchers. Iowa is an example. After they approved vouchers in 2022, private schools there increased their prices by over 20 percent for kindergarten and by over 10 percent for other grade levels. Here is another example on this argument that this program promotes choice. There are fewer private schools in rural communities. So many families do not have access to private schools if they live in rural communities. How does this expand choice for these families?  The reality is the majority of vouchers have gone to wealthy families and to subsidizing school tuition for students who already attend private schools. Under this bill, Republicans will make that even worse by prioritizing scholarships for these students. I am going to repeat that because not only is it bad enough that we are going to divert all of this money, basically, to private schools, but this bill actually has a provision that says people who will get these scholarships are students who already go to private schools. In Louisiana, for example, the 99 percent of voucher tax credits there went to families with annual incomes above 200,000. In Virginia, the number was 87 percent of vouchers in that State going to wealthy families. In Arizona, it was 60 percent. Americans have consistently rejected school voucher programs and initiatives. Nebraska, Kentucky, and Colorado have all voted against voucher programs within the last year. In Nebraska, school vouchers were put on the ballot last November, and they were soundly defeated for the fourth time. This is not a Democratic or Republican issue. Nebraska is a red State. They voted for a Republican President by a 20-point margin, and yet they rejected school vouchers with 57 percent of the vote. The bottom line is this: Vouchers take money away from public schools, and Americans of all political stripes understand that. According to All4Ed, over two-thirds of voters would rather increase funding for public schools than increase funding for voucher programs. That is not a new sentiment. In all 17 State referendums on school vouchers since 1967, voters have rejected these programs. While the Republicans in this Chamber may not give a rip about public schools, the vast majority of Americans get it. Democrats, Republicans, Independents alike support strengthening our public schools, not taking money away from our public schools, because they know that strong public education is fundamental to a strong country. Well, undeterred by public sentiment, Republicans are trying to create, as I mentioned, a nationwide school voucher program. It is not enough that some States have voucher programs, but now the Republicans, through this misguided, almost-thousand-pages-of-pain bill, want to provide $4 billion per year for a private school voucher program, with no accountability. Remember, early on, I said that a huge percentage of children with disabilities go to public schools. Well, private schools do not have any responsibility to make sure that they are providing education for children with disabilities. So there is no accountability.Let's just provide $4 billion per year, in perpetuity, in tax credits for private school programs that have no accountability along these lines. We all know that this kind of funding could be used for rural and low-income schools, for students with disabilities, for other programs that actually support and strengthen public schools. Instead, under the Republicans' plan, that funding would go to wealthy donors who will receive large handouts, up to $4 billion a year for supporting school vouchers. Again, this plan will enable a taxpayer making $10 million a year to contribute 1 million and receive a dollar-for-dollar credit for that full amount. And even worse, the taxpayer could contribute appreciated stock and avoid capital gains on their appreciation. And there is all kinds of data on who owns stocks in this country, and generally it is the people with a lot of wealth. So this bill had a provision that enabled people to donate appreciated stock so that they could escape capital gains taxes on that stock contribution totally. So this Republican voucher proposal, outlandish as it is, was briefly delayed after it was deemed noncompliant with budget rules earlier this week. Republicans remain undeterred. They have decided to plow forward with a nearly identical plan. When it comes down to it, this plan does not help students. It does not promote choice. It does not support public schools, where the majority of our kids go. We should be supporting our public schools, not taking resources away from them. So my Democratic colleagues and I will continue to fight to fund quality public schools, to improve public education in this country-- foundational. This voucher plan is yet another wrong-headed proposal that should be called out for what it is: a handout for the wealthy at the expense of hard-working American families. I urge my colleagues to reject this idea. I yield the floor."
"Sam Haycock is a name that most Members in the Chamber will not have heard before today, but it is my job to make sure that that 16-year-old's legacy does not end four years ago, when he was swimming in a South Yorkshire reservoir with his friends. I want Sam's name imprinted on everyone's brain and etched in everyone's heart today--not only in the name of Sam, but for his mum and for his dad, Simon, who came to Parliament yesterday and talked with me about my private Member's Bill on water safety. I met Sam's dad for the first time a couple of summers ago; that day at Thorne fire station, when many firefighters and service people were showing how to rescue someone safely from water, he handed me a picture of Sam. Sam's dad does that work week in, week out, tirelessly. Yesterday I could see the anguish in his eyes still, because that call that he got will never go away. It makes such a difference to him to be able to go out and educate children and their families about swimming safely, the dangers and risks, and what learning about those dangers can mean for protecting lives in the future. Unfortunately, if we look back to 2023, there were another 236 or so Sams out there. That is 236 parents, friends or colleagues who got that same horrible knock at the door or that awful phone call. Some 50% of drownings happen in the months of June, July and August--so half of all drownings this year will happen in the next three months. Of course, it is hot, and this year in particular has been super-hot in the lead-up to summer. That prevailing weather is only a bigger risk in terms of the potential numbers that could join those other Sams. Some 5.8 million children finish their GCSEs today or tomorrow, as the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Monica Harding) said. Sam died on the day that he  finished his GCSEs and went swimming with his friends to celebrate. Across the UK, we have some of the most beautiful watercourses. We have 22 major rivers, 2,000 reservoirs, 273 major reservoirs and 600 designated beaches. Those offer opportunities for any child to go and swim--just to try it, perhaps for the first time. Of course, there is a balance here; water can be good. It is good for physical health, and it is great for mental health. It is a great source of tourism, sports and leisure in our communities. Some 7.5 million people take part or have taken part in open water swimming. One of those people is Lindsy James, who lives in and works across my community. She is a world champion duathlete, who has only recently learned to swim as she had a fear of water; she has shown how swimming can build resilience and confidence. Given the amount of water that we have, the most important thing is education, because we cannot protect all the different sites that I have talked about. That is why I am so proud that my Water Safety Bill had a reception this week. The Bill would make compulsory water safety education part of this Government's legal duty, which would save lives--that is the reason we are here today. Our job is to enrich lives, to save lives and to protect lives. Sam Haycock's story does not need to end on that day four years ago; there needs to be a legacy. He may not go on to fulfil all the dreams he had on the day he finished his GCSEs, but his legacy can and will allow others to fulfil their dreams."
"I understand the force and the emotion behind my hon. Friend's question. I have spoken to families about the obvious agonies of the process of identification. I will look into the circumstance that he describes. He mentioned the Indian High Commission, to whom I pass on my thanks for its hard work, particularly in rapidly facilitating visas for family members to be able to go out to see their loved ones."
"I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham and Beckton (James Asser) on securing this debate, so that we can learn from the covid years. I first pay tribute to the amazing health workers, volunteers and key workers who supported us through that turbulent time, and I will focus my brief contribution on the often overlooked impact that covid had on maternity services and pregnancy, and on the lived experiences of women. We know that women were shut out of the highest levels of decision making during the pandemic, and their voices were sidelined. Research from the London School of Economics and Political Science found that the Conservative Government consistently failed to consider gender in their response to covid-19. During covid, the Maternal Mental Health Alliance reported a sharp rise in maternal anxiety, and the already concerning gaps in perinatal mental health services widened further. Informed support networks, which are so vital to new mothers, were decimated by lockdowns and restrictions. The withdrawal of home birth services and the closure of midwife-led units during the pandemic curtailed women's autonomy over how and where to give birth. That shift saw many women forced to deliver in hospitals where covid-19 was actively being treated, heightening the health risk for mothers and newborns. Post-natal services also suffered immensely. A coalition of 13 pregnancy and baby charities gave evidence about covid-19, and they spoke about the way that the needs of mothers and new parents were consistently overlooked in critical healthcare decisions. For instance, one-year assessments were done by video call; there was a lack of replacement for in-person baby classes; and there were no health visitors or community practitioners. We are running short of time, so in conclusion, I remind the House that roughly 1.85 million babies were born during the UK pandemic years, and all those children have mothers who had to face that time alone, confused and forgotten. We owe it to every parent, midwife and newborn to ensure that never happens again. Let that be our legacy--not just remembrance, but the resolve to build a health system that is resilient, compassionate and prepared. The next generation deserves to be welcomed into a world that has learned from its past and strives for better."
I am happy to meet my hon. Friend to discuss those matters further.
"I rise today to recognize the University of Georgia and its remarkable students for achieving a national distinction in international education. UGA now ranks second in the Nation for the prestigious Boren Awards, a testament to its academic excellence in global engagement. These awards help support students who are studying languages and cultures critical to national security and U.S. interests. In 2025, seven UGA students were selected, securing funding for their education and creating a pathway to public service. I congratulate Jack, Nicholas, Sara, Sadie, Madison, Mark, and Jessica on their well-deserved achievement. Their work embodies the values and work ethic of the University of Georgia. The university's success reflects the amazing work of its faculty, staff, and students.  Cheers to Nic Wallace"
"Mr. Speaker, how does taxing Canadian industries help affordability for families struggling with high prices?"
"Mr. Speaker, this is a little bit out of the scope of my colleague's file, but the Liberals really missed a key opportunity with this piece of legislation. Over seven million Canadians are without a primary care physician. We are in a mental health crisis within our country, and they could have very easily included provisions for a blue seal program within this bill. I would like to hear our hon. colleague's comments."
"As the founder of Labour: Women in Tech, I wholeheartedly welcome the industrial strategy's ambitious goals to scale  our tech sector and workforce. On 15 July in Parliament, I am hosting WeAreTechWomen and Oliver Wyman for the launch of the Lovelace report. The report has identified that between 40,000 and 60,000 female professionals are leaving the tech sector annually or seeking advancement opportunities elsewhere, which represents well over PS1 billion of economic opportunity that could be unlocked by better supporting our existing skilled workforce. Does the Secretary of State agree that both inspiring new talent and supporting great existing talent and diverse teams, across all demographics, is fundamental to maximising returns on our industrial strategy investments and securing the UK's position as a world-leading technology nation?"
"There is a difference of principle on the question of human rights, because there are two lives involved in these decisions. That is the fundamental problem."
"I am really grateful for the work of the Education Committee, which is excellently chaired by my hon. Friend. Does she agree that cutting the value of grants to families from the adoption and special guardianship support fund will put more pressure on children's social care and leave children without the vital support they need?"
"Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, I think that the leader of the Bloc Québécois is misreading the situation. There was an election campaign, and we debated at length. We even wrote on the first page of our platform that we would pass such a bill before Canada Day. That is what we are doing. Quebec and Quebeckers are facing an economic crisis of unexpected magnitude. The signs are there. The province's credit rating has been downgraded. Aluminum workers are certainly experiencing a crisis. Our supply chains and ports are struggling. Quebeckers have asked us to take action, and that is what we are doing. Does the leader of the Bloc Québécois not share—"
"Madam Speaker, it is always a great honour to rise in this place and speak on behalf of the good people of Okanagan Lake West—South Kelowna. I will be splitting my time with the hon. member of Parliament for Mirabel . For the record, Bill C-5 is not perfect and, with respect, there are a few concerns I must point out. Let me start with the glaringly obvious. This bill is dubbed as the “one Canadian economy act”, and yet one of the first things we learn is that provinces and territories must provide consent on major projects. In other words, they have a veto. When a veto is provided to 13 different provinces and territories, we are not creating one Canadian economy. If anything, it is completely the opposite. In fact, a cynic might suggest that parts of this bill are designed to fail because the Prime Minister just spent an entire election making big promises that he had no intention of fulfilling. Why did he not get anything built, someone might ask the Prime Minister, who could then reply that there was no agreement on what to build. There, I submit by design, is a huge flaw within this bill. However, we also know this bill contains other measures, in particular, under “Free Trade and Labour Mobility in Canada”, taking action or, in this case, legislatively proposing to take action on internal trade barriers, which have long been a passion of mine. I will expand on that point. When I was first elected to this place as someone totally wet behind the ears and a rookie MP, I was fortunate to draw quite highly in the private members' lottery order of precedence. Back in 2011, before the NDP was in power in British Columbia, tourism was not under attack and, indeed, there were a great many Canadian visitors in my riding every summer. Visiting local wineries, even in those days, with over 200 of them, has always been an immensely popular thing to do. Unfortunately, for visiting tourists from other provinces, they could not buy wine at those wineries to take back home with them. Why? Because there was an archaic Prohibition-era federal law that made it illegal to transport wine in person or to have it shipped across the provincial border. Long-time members of this place might recall that I proposed a private member's bill to remedy this and create true free trade in Canadian wine, or so I had hoped. In those days, the NDP was our official opposition, hard to believe now, I know, which looked to slow down my bill. However, with the help of some Liberals, in particular, former Liberal MP Scott Brison, my bill was accelerated and passed in this House and the other place. Immediately after, Nova Scotia, Manitoba and British Columbia adopted the spirit of my bill; other provinces, not so much. One actually made regulatory changes to block what my bill had achieved. I mention this because the Prime Minister has, unfortunately, made some outlandish statements, promises really. One was that there will be no interprovincial trade barriers by July 1. He also suggested that the elimination of these internal trade barriers will create another $200 billion of economic activity into our Canadian economy. I am not certain if this is wishful thinking or wilful political misrepresentation as a result of the recent election. Either way, I submit that expectations have been created that Bill C-5 will just not live up to. This is not to say that the federal government should not do everything it can to eliminate interprovincial trade barriers. To some extent, this part of Bill C‑5 certainly does propose that, and that is why I am prepared to support it. However, I must also return to the need for consensus found in the other part of Bill C-5. While the Liberal government will allow provinces and territories to veto major projects, we also have to recognize that many interprovincial trade barriers are erected in exactly the same way when one province essentially refuses to come to an agreement with the others. That is what frustrates me about this bill, because it contains a certain amount of double-talk and mixed messages. I must also point out the obvious. Since 2015, the Liberals have passed several bills, such as Bill C‑69 and Bill C‑48 , that have killed many Canadian energy projects. The Liberals know this, of course, but they are too arrogant to admit the obvious. Fundamentally, the Liberals have created a regulatory environment that is no longer accessible to the private sector. Instead of fixing this, which would be the obvious solution, the Liberals created Bill C‑5 , which proposes to circumvent and accelerate these regulatory hurdles through a new political process, subject to everyone's agreement, of course. The exact mechanism of this political process is an enigma. I would like to point out that, in the past, our former Liberal government kept trying to try to buy jobs in the electric vehicle battery sector. As we now know, many of these investments, as the Liberals call them, completely failed, as is often the case when governments pick winners and losers by using politics as a criterion. I also have to come back to another point that concerns me. A few months ago, when campaigning to become the new Liberal leader, our now Prime Minister flew into Kelowna, and while there he told supporters that he would use emergency government powers to build energy projects. A part of that was the “build baby build” thing we heard so much during the election. Of course, in Bill C-5 , there is no such language about using emergency government powers to build anything. Instead, what they say here is that there must be consensus, and of course, the NDP Premier of B.C., David Eby, has already said “no”. He will not support any new Canadian pipelines built with Canadian steel that export Canadian oil and gas by getting it to tidewater. He will, however, say yes to B.C. ferries built with Chinese steel by Chinese workers in a Chinese state-owned shipyard. I mention that last part, because none of the Chinese steel is subject to any industrial carbon tax, unlike here in Canada, where Canadian steel remains subject to the Liberals' industrial carbon tax. On an interview with CTV Atlantic, the Prime Minister was clear that steel made by industry would be targeted for increases to offset his political 180° turn on the consumer carbon tax. This, of course, makes our Canadian steel more expensive and less competitive against Chinese steel with no carbon tax. If this Liberal government was truly serious about building one Canadian economy, why ignore the fact that Canadian industries need a regulatory environment that is competitive and that creates incentives for investment that would lead to great-paying Canadian jobs? Bill C‑5 completely misses the mark on those points. We are left with rather modest steps, despite huge promises to the contrary. At least those steps are in the right direction, but this bill could and should have been much more ambitious. I would like to sincerely thank all members for taking the time to listen to my comments and concerns today."
"Madam Speaker, I think it was less than six weeks ago that Canadians went to the polls and elected every member of Parliament in this place. It was a very interesting election, and at least in the Waterloo region, we saw a record number of Canadians engaging. I listened to what they had to say at the doors, and it was not a monolith; there was a diversity of views and perspectives. However, there was definitely a sentiment that government has a role to play. What the member said was quite telling today. It is the first time that a Conservative has been so honest in saying the government has to “stop doing”. One thing Canadians in my community knew is that a Conservative government, and let it not happen anytime soon, would not invest in Canadians and would not be there for Canadians because Conservatives do not believe that government has a role to play. The member has a history of voting against benefits and programs, such as the Canada child benefit, national child care and dental care, and voting against constituents, against Canadians. Is he recognizing that in this legislation, there are important measures that Canadians have supported and expect to see advance? Could he see himself advancing measures in this legislation to benefit Canadians ?"
"Does the Prime Minister agree that, in the context of the threat posed by Putin, we must provide more guidance and support to Britons to prepare them for the possibility of a future conflict, and that that should involve a national resilience campaign?"
Agreed.
"The hon. Member is making a detailed and impassioned speech about the possibilities for transport investment throughout the country. Does he recognise the value of electrification of the Cornish main line? The benefit would be in the region of 10 times the cost, and there would be potential for a grid upgrade of the kind he mentioned."
"In Rossendale and Darwen we have real concerns about rural crime and its impact on our farms and village communities. We have excellent, hard-working rural crime teams, but they cover vast areas with limited resources. One team with a single vehicle between six officers covers three local authority areas. Will the Leader of the House agree to a debate on the rural crime strategy, and the resources required to deliver it?"
"Mr. Speaker, I find it quite colonial with the member for Winnipeg North , particularly because indigenous peoples and nations from across this country have been very clear that the government has not fulfilled its duty of free, prior and informed consent. Organizations including AFN, ITK, NAN and the Union of BC Indian Chiefs have come forward and called out the government. They have not received—"
I will just confirm that the hon. member is splitting his time three ways.
"I do not want to speak for the Chief Minister, but I know that he was expecting for there to be the appropriate scrutiny of the Bill in the Gibraltar parliamentary system. Of course, as we would expect, this has garnered a lot of attention in Gibraltar. I have given my undertaking to the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, my right hon. Friend the Member for Islington South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry). I recognise that this is an important last aspect of our decision to leave the European Union and that it needs the appropriate parliamentary scrutiny."
"Oh, oh!"
"Mr. Speaker, I shared sitting on the status of women committee with the member from 2019 until the last Parliament. We did a lot of work in the status of women committee together on betterment for women. Our Liberal government is committed to working for betterment for women. As members know, child care is also there, even $10 day care. When I was door knocking, I heard very positive feedback from women, single mothers, and it is a big help. In this 45th Parliament, let us work together to do more on betterment for women."
"Since July, we have driven over PS1.5 billion of private investment into Wales, delivering hundreds of jobs. Last month, I was delighted to welcome Knauf Insulation's new PS170 million investment in Shotton. Our Welsh freeports and investment zones will unlock further private investment and deliver tens of thousands of jobs across all four corners of Wales. Last month, Lloyds Bank reported a significant increase in Welsh business confidence, and our industrial strategy will provide further confidence to invest in Wales."
"Mr. Speaker, I will give the same answer to the same question. My job is to ensure that Canada achieves net-zero emissions by 2050 and that we always consider the environment when completing projects. That is what I am doing, and I am committed to doing so every day."
"Madam Speaker, even hybrid electric cars would not qualify, and if there are still internal combustion vehicles on the roads or owned by people, they would not be able to get fuel because the new fuel standards are eliminating the gasoline that would fuel ICE cars, those with internal combustion engines. Even if we cannot afford an EV and all we have is gas power, the gas will not be available."
"Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that $64 million was awarded to two guys in a basement who did not do the work, and today we are here asking for the money back. Government members can kick the can and can blame civil service. I listened for 16 minutes, and the member kicked the can and passed the buck to everybody but excused himself. The taxpayers want their $64 million money back. I am an elected official and my voice is being heard here today on behalf of my citizens. They want their money back."
"Madam Speaker, I am a big fan of jazz. I am not as talented as Miles Davis, but I do play the trumpet. I thank the member for making that association. We have already started doing things we can be proud of. We are already going ahead with some big plans, like the tax cut I just mentioned. We also have plenty of other plans that we will be talking about more in the coming weeks."
I call the Chair of the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee.
"I thank the right hon. Gentleman and member of the Treasury Select Committee for his question. We have made the allocation to the Department of Health and Social Care--an annual uplift of PS29 billion--and it will be up to the Secretary of State to allocate that money, but I will make sure that he has heard the right hon. Gentleman's question and that he gets a proper reply to him."
"I thank my hon. Friend for raising that vital point. This Government are looking at character references carefully, and we will bring forward information on that in due course."
I call the shadow Minister.
"Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Auditor General for her report on office space and federal lands. I note that we accept all recommendations. I also note that she highlights that progress has been made. We are on the way to meeting our objectives in terms of affordable housing on public lands and federal lands. This is very good news for Canadians."
"Madam Speaker, the member says that Liberals are building one economy and are working on it. How can they build one economy when they are not taking into consideration the oil and energy sector of Alberta?"
"Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his excellent question. I worked in banking for over 20 years and at the chamber of commerce for four years. Business people often asked us why the government would pit projects against each other. Why are environmental projects and economic development projects being pitted against each other? Why not combine them? Surveys have been conducted over the years and have found that people want projects to be carried out collaboratively. That is what the Prime Minister is proposing today with respect to the sustainable economy. It is for Canada and for Canada's economic future. Let us stop pitting our projects against one another and let us combine them instead."
"Many of my constituents have raised concerns about the use of RAF Akrotiri to support Israel's military activity in Gaza. Given the rapidly developing  situation with Iran, can Ministers assure this House that British arms and military bases will not be likewise implicated in any further escalations of that conflict?"
"Madam Chair, I realize that we are playing to TikTok and other social media. Our bail system is something that we committed to strengthen, and we will do that."
I have another point of order from the member for Dufferin—Caledon.
"Mr. Speaker, it was not difficult for me. I got two-thirds of the votes of my constituents, so I have a strong mandate to share—"
"Mr. Speaker, if the minister is committed to tackling the cost of living crisis, will she remove the industrial carbon tax?"
"Mr. Speaker, from the beginning, it has made absolutely no sense for the government to want to tie itself to the EV mandate for the next nine years until it does some weird mental gymnastics and backs out of the very central piece of its policy. It is the very fact that Canadians cannot choose. It does not make economic sense, particularly in that member's riding, for anybody to drive an EV. It takes a good couple of hours to get around his riding, and I suspect the charging infrastructure is not there and will not be there. The Liberals are married to a plan that does not work. I suspect, after they get bonked over the head with it over the next couple of years, there will be a reversal, just like there was with the carbon tax when Conservatives pushed them to drop it."
"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Although they did not mention it before the election, Labour is committed to abolishing every district and borough council in Leicestershire. It has also invited proposals to expand the city's boundaries, and the Mayor of Leicester has put forward such a proposal. This is universally not wanted in Oadby, Wigston, Great Glen and the surrounding villages--in fact, thousands of people have signed a petition against it--so can we please at least have a debate in Government time on that proposal? Will the Leader of the House encourage the Local Government Minister not to allow this expansion of the city? It is not just the higher council tax; people want to keep their local identity. If the Government are going to go ahead with the proposal, will they at least allow people to vote in a referendum?"
"Mr. Speaker, the truth is that the Liberal government had a report in front of it demonstrating that this policy was going to devastate rural Canada, and it did absolutely nothing. The Liberal environment ministers, one after the other, have done absolutely nothing. I am very frustrated with the government right now."
"We announced PS502 million to support local authorities to manage the changes in NICs. We have put in PS3.7 billion in additional funding for social care, doubled the disabled facilities grant and introducing the first ever fair pay agreement for professional carers, including minimum standards for pay. I gently say to the hon. Member that her party opposed the Budget that provides the money for the funding. They cannot keep asking for more spending and oppose a Budget that raises the money."
"Mr. Chair, I met with the IRB chair and board, and they have advised me that they are working on their time—"
I have a point of order from the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader.
"My hon. Friend is right that defence is a reserved matter, and so it is appropriate for this place to introduce a UK-wide Armed Forces Commissioner. It is also right that whoever is appointed to the role of Armed Forces Commissioner is able to raise issues of concern with the Administrations in every part of the United Kingdom--whether it is London, Edinburgh, Cardiff or Belfast. Equally, they should be able to engage with local councils. The Armed Forces Commissioner role builds on the work of the Service Complaints Ombudsman, who already has a good working relationship with the devolved Administrations, so I am certain that whoever is appointed to role will be able to build on that and make sure that, for instance, if a housing issue is highlighted by someone based in Scotland, that can be raised with the appropriate individuals in the Scottish Government. Lords amendment 7 will ensure that the language in section 340N of the 2006 Act is also updated from ""officer"" to ""person"" so that there is no inconsistency in the legislation. I will now turn to Lords amendments 2 and 3 and the debate that took place in the other place about whistleblowing. I thank Baroness Goldie, one of the previous Defence Ministers in the House of Lords, in whose name the amendments were tabled, for her characteristically considered and constructive contributions to the Bill's passage and for raising a serious issue. The amendments seek to introduce a new general function for the commissioner ""to investigate concerns raised by a whistleblower in relation to the welfare of persons subject to service law and their relevant family members,"" and to define the term ""whistleblower"" for the purposes of this Bill. We believe that the amendments, while well intentioned, are unnecessary because the Bill is already designed to provide a voice for armed forces personnel and their  families outside the chain of command. The commissioner can already investigate any general service welfare matter that they choose; anyone can raise an issue with the commissioner, including the type of person defined in Baroness Goldie's amendment; and the commissioner is independent, sits outside the chain of command and the Ministry of Defence, and reports directly to Parliament and not to senior officers nor to Ministers."
"I feel a bit sorry for the hon. Gentleman; it is hard on a day like this to be an Opposition Member. Nevertheless, I will try to answer his questions, such as they are. On the question about the final investment decision, he will be aware that we are currently doing the private sector capital raise. When that is complete, we will proceed to the final investment decision, which will take place this summer. That is obviously important. On his fundamental question, I do slightly scratch my head, because he says that this is a downgrade--we have announced the largest nuclear building programme in 50 years! What he says might have looked good in the mirror this morning, but it does not bear much resemblance to reality. The question, which goes to the point I made at the end of my statement, is this: why did the Conservatives make all these promises on nuclear but fail to deliver them? There is a simple answer. It was not because of a lack of diligence from his colleague the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Andrew Bowie). The simple reason is that they did not put up the money. They did not make the investment. The one thing that has bedevilled the nuclear programme is a failure to invest public money. In this spending review we are putting in PS14 billion for Sizewell, PS2.5 billion for SMRs, and PS2.5 billion for fusion. Those are significant sums of long-term capital investment. The Conservatives made all these promises,  but they did not put in the money. I was the guy who identified Sizewell, and I am back here delivering Sizewell. This Government are willing to make the investment. We welcome the support from the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Nick Timothy), such as it is, but he needs to learn some lessons. Public investment, not decline, is the answer for Britain."
"It is tempting to remind the Secretary of State about the 4.5% to 5% of GDP that was spent on defence by Conservative Governments throughout the cold war years of the 1980s, but instead may I ask whether, like me, he would endorse what Admiral Lord West wrote in the national press last week, when he stated that the Chagos deal was a ""disgraceful decision"", and that as a former chief of defence intelligence, he did not accept that the move is ""absolutely vital for our defence and intelligence"" as the Prime Minister claims? He is a former Labour security Minister and current House of Lords representative on the Intelligence and Security Committee, so he knows what he is talking about, doesn't he?"
"Mr. Chair, does the minister think the amount of time spent on vetting Muhammad Khan, who was the student arrested last year for plotting an ISIS attack in New York whose social media had extremist content, was sufficient?"
"as chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Northwood Foods as the Senate Small Business of the Week. In 1998, Brian Burkard founded Northwood Foods in Northwood, IA, with a vision to provide high-quality, custom pork processing services. The company began with a focus on boning and fabrication, quickly gaining traction in the industry. Within just 2 years, it expanded to serve clients not only across the United States but internationally. The rapid growth prompted major facility expansions in 2001 and 2006 to support increased demand for its products and services. Today, Northwood Foods operates a 40,000-square-foot facility and employs more than 180 community employees. Renowned for its quality products and reliable service, the company now processes more than 600,000 pounds of fresh pork daily. Northwood Foods then ships the pork products directly to many of the Nation's premier pork processors for further production and distribution. Northwood Foods offers a wide range of pork processing services, including both standardized and custom-cut products tailored to client needs. Its versatile capabilities allow for pork ham boning, loin boning, rib cutting, and specialty fabrication. The company produces a broad selection of cuts, from semi-boneless and skinless shanks to various bone-in and boneless options. With a strong emphasis on food safety, consistency, and customer service, Northwood Foods upholds rigorous quality control standards and operates a production schedule 5 days a week to meet domestic and international demand. In addition to its industry leadership, Northwood Foods is deeply committed to giving back to the Northwood community and the surrounding area. As a proud Purple Ribbon Partner of the Worth County Fair, the company plays a vital role in supporting this annual event. Their sponsorship helps ensure the fair remains a vibrant celebration of the area's farming heritage and community spirit. Northwood Foods is also a member of the Northwood Chamber of Commerce and supports national industry organizations, including the U.S. Meat Export Federation and the American Association of Meat Processors. In February, Northwood Foods celebrated its 27th anniversary. I want to congratulate Brian Burkard and the entire team at Northwood Foods for their dedication and continued leadership in the pork processing industry, alongside their long-standing commitment to quality, innovation, and community support. I look forward to seeing their continued growth and success."
"I firmly agree with the hon. Gentleman that a level playing field is not just an economic necessity, but a matter of economic security and production in western economies like our own. Of course, if a company has a specific case to make, it should make the representation to the Trade Remedies Authority directly--I have that power, but it would usually come from industry. If the company has a specific case to make, the hon. Gentleman should encourage it to make that representation."
"Mr. Chair, I am committed to improving the services of any service provider to the public service. I expect the service provider to be up to the standard and to stay within those guidelines."
"I hope the Minister appreciates just how insulting it is to Welsh ears for us to be told that we are getting a fair deal on railway funding, when we know that we have been cheated out of billions of pounds due to the classification of several projects as England and Wales projects. Wales is getting only five railway stations between Newport and Cardiff. That is hardly national renewal, is it? Will he bet on Wales and commit to projects outside that belt, such as projects across mid-Wales and west Wales or the electrification of the north and south lines?"
"Mr. Speaker, as I said, in December the government proposed regulations to cap greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and gas sector. It then held consultations and conversations with the industry and Canadians. It continues to do that work. So—"
"The right hon. Gentleman raises an important question. Ultimately, the final decisions will need to be for the independent chair and the commission--that is what happens when we set it up as a national inquiry, rather than a Government process. He will know that concerns have been raised about investigations and inquiries that have taken place in Greater Manchester, where some areas could not be compelled to take part. As a result, there has been work with His Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary to pursue the final stages of an investigation and inquiry. We did look at whether there were other powers, either through local government Acts or through police inspection powers. However, the simplest way to address this issue is for it to be done through the national inquiry. The right hon. Gentleman will be able to make representations about his area, and other MPs will be able to make representations about their areas too."
What steps she is taking to support high streets
"Mr. Speaker, there are many, many supports in the plan. Of course, we know there is significant investment into skills training for young people, for the training but also for employers who bring them on. There is an $8,000 investment into skills training, and there is also $10,000 for the employer to support that good work. There are many supports. Of course, we are always looking to work with members of other parties, to bring our voices and to get this good work done."
"I must interrupt the debate. The hon. member will have approximately four and a half minutes to conclude, following this afternoon's vote."
"Mr. Chair, my answer will be based in part on a question that I must put to my colleague on the opposite side of the chamber. Will the Conservatives be voting in favour of this important measure? Yes or no? It is now their—"
"Mr. Speaker, since 2015, child poverty is down by 38%. That is because of programs such as the Canada child benefit. That is because of programs such as affordable child care, which is available all across the country. We are working with families. We are working with youth and children, and we will continue to do that work together. We hope the opposition gets on board."
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the new member. He made a comment earlier that really got my attention about how opposition members do nothing but oppose and never propose anything. It is the complete opposite. The Bloc Québécois is known here for being hard-working and thorough, for proposing solutions, for improving things and for co-operating. Perhaps no one informed him of this when he arrived for his orientation. I would simply like to tell him that he can count on us to improve things and make suggestions. Now it is up to the government to listen and implement the opposition's common-sense solutions. I have a more specific question. My colleague is from a Montreal riding where there are a lot of newcomers and a lot of problems with the immigration department. Can he tell us whether, in his opinion, Bill C-2 will help reduce processing times for refugee claims?"
"Mr. Speaker, in the past, we know there have been incentives and subsidies offered at the federal and provincial levels to both encourage the growth of the industry and assist people with purchasing electric vehicles. I am wondering if my honourable colleague across the aisle would support that."
"I am always happy to meet my hon. Friend. I can confirm that in the design and funding of NISTA, I have funded a particular team to work on the management of disputes under the old PFI contract schemes to make sure that we are getting the best outcomes and best deal for the public sector."
"Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to stand here in the House of Commons. Congratulations on your success in becoming the Speaker. I paid close attention to your speech, and I look forward to your leadership as you shepherd us through the 45th Parliament. When I was first elected in 2015, people asked me how long I planned on running for. I said it would be as long as I have the sense of awe when I walk into the House of Commons. I still have that sense of awe today as we sit here in West Block. Previously, in 2015, we were in Centre Block, which is undergoing a major rebuild. I am struck that I have had the opportunity to sit in both places. It has been truly an honour. I did not get here today to make this speech without the support and help of so many volunteers and supporters in Sault Ste. Marie—Algoma. My riding is one of the new ridings after the electoral commission went through a process of reviewing what kind of seats should be in Canada. At the time, the commission recommended getting rid of one of the seats in Northern Ontario, and that ended up being Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing, which was held by Carol Hughes, who sat as assistant deputy speaker and who served the area quite well for 18 years. My riding got all of Algoma plus parts of Sudbury. At the time, I argued against the change because northern Ontario did not need one fewer voice. However, to that matter, I knew that I could represent the area very well. My father was born in Blind River, Ontario, in 1929, in the new riding. My family made it to Blind River via the traditional Irish story. My father's grandfather came over on a boat during the famine; my great-grandfather travelled with his mother, father and brother. Crossing the ocean during the potato famine, the mother passed and was given a burial at sea. Then the father passed and was given a burial at sea, leaving the two young boys orphaned. The Québécois adopted my great-grandfather and allowed him to keep our name. That was on a farm in the Saguenay area. That was sort of our origin story. Eventually my great-grandfather went out west, to where his brother had been adopted on another farm, in Saskatchewan. The family lost the farm because of hail and a number of other things. This was before insurance. My great-grandfather made his way to Blind River to manage a hotel and to stay there. It was great knocking on doors in that area in particular, because I could hear about a lot of the issues in Algoma east, which were similar to the new issues that I heard in Algoma north. To drive my riding from tip to tip takes about eight hours. That is not unusual for many members of the House. However, when the change happened, David Akin from Global TV contacted me and said that my riding probably has some of the most significant changes related to geography and population, because we had over 100,000 electors. I think it was about 114,000. I had spent a long time working in that area, in business and economic development, skill development and apprenticeships, so I felt quite at home. It was my secondary home. I just wanted to acknowledge that great area because I represented Sault Ste. Marie before, which had part of Algoma, but not that significant area. It was absolutely fantastic. The people were really impressed with the platform and the vision of the new leader of the Liberal Party, soon to be the Prime Minister . I heard again and again that the new Prime Minister had people's trust because of his ability to shepherd us through the new challenge. I could not stand here making this speech without recognizing all the great volunteers who supported me. We did not have much infrastructure in Sault Ste. Marie—Algoma, but it was amazing. We made pleas on social media, and people came through our door. Many of them had volunteered on other political campaigns before. Many of them had never, ever, voted Liberal, but they came through the door because they saw how critically important this election was. Some people who came through the door had never, ever worked on any political campaign. I was very touched that so many people volunteered, so I want to thank all of them, including the new volunteers from all over Sault Ste. Marie—Algoma. However, I would be remiss not to thank the people who have worked on all four of my campaigns. They have been there every time. It was absolutely amazing. One of the media pointed out that it was the first time Liberals had won four times in a row in that riding. It is always a horse race among all the political parties. I would not be standing here again without those volunteers. My heartfelt thanks goes out to them and to my supporters and donors. There were so many that I cannot name them all. Within that group, some of my best volunteers were, of course, my family. As I mentioned during question period today, I am celebrating my 25th wedding anniversary with my wife, Lisa Bradford, whom I met many years ago. I was already in politics. In November, I will celebrate 28 years of local representation, which started with the school board and city council. There is an old saying that behind every great man and woman, there is a partner. In my case, my partner is not behind me but beside me, and I say chi meegwetch to her. Before I go too far, I would like to also acknowledge that the land I am on right now is the traditional territory of the Algonquin. My wife and kids are members of the Batchewana First Nation. In my new area, there are also the Ojibwe and Cree first nations. I thank them for sharing their land with us, and I give thanks to all indigenous people across this great nation, including the Métis, for sharing their land with us. As I went to the door in the new riding, the number one concern for people was, of course, the threat to our sovereignty, the constant badgering by the American administration about Canada's becoming the 51st state. It was amazing: I was knocking on doors in Elliot Lake, and senior citizens had some of the strongest words of opposition. Some of them used words that I cannot use in the House. They were standing up strong and hard because they built this country to be what it is today. The Prime Minister 's words resonated very strongly with them about standing up to Donald Trump. In my riding, there are two major steel operations: Algoma Steel, which is the second-largest steel producer in all of Canada, and Tenaris Algoma Tubes, which produces tubing for the oil and gas industry across Canada. With threats of tariffs, I used to say that I had seen this movie before, but the reality of the new American administration is a movie I have never seen before. It is something that is beyond belief, beyond comprehension, with the continual up and down. We can hear another announcement from the American administration, and by the end of the day, it has changed. The reality of that unsteadiness has created a lot of angst, and rightly so. In 2018, we did have tariffs, but we stood up with countermeasures. We supported workers. That is why I was really pleased to see in the Speech from the Throne particular sections that deal with our relationship with the United States of America, which has always been a critical partner to us. We have always been friends. We always refer to each other as cousins. There have been misunderstandings before. Sometimes, because of the great size of their country, they do not really pay attention, and not just to Canada but to the rest of the world. I remember one time when I was at Lake State, which is a university across the way where I studied poli sci and business, we came back across the border in my car. We were waiting in line at the border and we were taking a bit of time. My friends in the back said, “Would it not be great if we were just one big, great country?” I looked at them and said, “Yes, it would be great having one prime minister” and they said, “Say what?” We began that kind of conversation. Again, given the Speech from the Throne, dealing with the United States in particular in a multitude of fashions is important. As we renegotiate CUSMA, it is critical that we have a Prime Minister with great business acumen who is known around the world and can sit straight across the table and deal with that administration. However, to deal with that administration, we also need to diversify our economy, and that is why when the Prime Minister talks about one economy, it resonates so much with me and the constituents across my great riding. We all know in this House that we are a Confederation of 10 provinces and three territories, and it is strange, especially for me, having worked in business, economic development and skills development, that it is difficult for people to do business with each other within Canada. Tearing down these barriers and having what was referred to today in question period as a love-in, with people like Premier Ford saying it was the best meeting he has seen in 10 years, are critically important. The fact that we are working together sends a signal to our American friends that we can be dependent upon each other. If we tear down those barriers, $200 billion will be added to our economy. However, when I think about that, it is not just about that $200 billion. Over the last few years, I have been co-chair of the Canada-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Group. Japan is the third-greatest foreign direct investor in Canada, and when we tear down those barriers, it makes it easier for other countries to do business with us, as we can locate plants anywhere, in particular in Sault Ste. Marie—Algoma, which is really central in Canada. It could be a logistical hub. There are great opportunities. This ambitious Speech from the Throne, which King Charles III delivered so eloquently, also identifies a mountain of opportunities related to growing our economy and working together as the sovereign state that we are. With King Charles III here, it definitely demonstrated that we are different from the United States. We are a Confederation. We are a mosaic of people. We expect people to keep their identities throughout Canada, just as my family did in Quebec. In the United States, they expect people to melt into the pot, and that is so different. The Canadian economy, that one economy, is absolutely critical. We have so much potential to deal with such important things. As it relates to Sault Ste. Marie—Algoma, we are also a border community. A lot of trade comes across the way, so building up our infrastructure is absolutely critical. Ports, rail, roads and corridors for trade are so important because that stuff can absolutely be funnelled into the United States once we get back to our relationship. That makes so much sense, because we cannot deny that the United States is always going to be a factor as a trading partner. I sit on the trade committee, and a lot of stuff is continually going north-south, but we have to secure our borders. We have to secure our borders in a way that makes sense. We know for a fact that we are not the problem as it relates to the United States' issue with fentanyl. Using its own data, we know we are less than 1%. However, today we introduced the strong borders act, which is going to make Canada even stronger. That is critically important. Being on a border town, I know for a fact that drugs are coming from the United States into Canada and illegal guns are coming through. In the Speech from the Throne, the King talked about investing in the RCMP and having 1,000 new RCMP officers. It is absolutely critical for us to make sure that we keep the bad people and the bad stuff out of this country. This is after 10 years of cuts by the previous government. We know that almost $1 billion was cut from both the RCMP and the Canada Border Services Agency. We have already rehired, but we are going to go further on that. We are looking forward to that in Sault Ste. Marie, to make sure that we keep investing to keep our streets safe. The act goes further into a multitude of things. As we are talking about safety and safety issues, the Speech from the Throne also talked about how we are going to rebuild our military. The Canadian Armed Forces is absolutely critical. My college roommate, one of my best friends, Captain Donald McFarling, served two terms in Afghanistan. He is currently a professor at the Royal Military College. We thank all the men and women who have served our country, who have protected our country from threats and who have policed areas in peacekeeping missions. As I mentioned, I am now serving Algoma, the place where Lester B. Pearson served. He served that area so well. Everything in Elliot Lake is named after Lester B. Pearson. He was a great prime minister, always one of my favourites, and it is truly an honour to serve where he did. We are rebuilding the military for the right reasons: so that we are less reliant on the United States. As we rebuild and refurbish our military, it will be good for Sault Ste. Marie—Algoma because Algoma Steel makes armour-grade plate. In fact, it is the only place in Canada that makes armour-grade plate of its significance. This steel will be used in the shipbuilding program and in rebuilding our armoured vehicles. It is so important because it is the right thing to do, and it is also going to help create jobs in Sault Ste. Marie—Algoma. This is an ambitious plan that the premiers and the Prime Minister talked about in Saskatchewan. My grandfather worked on a farm. It is so important that we have the ability to work together. When we build, we are creating jobs upstream and downstream in the supply chains. Getting our resources to tidal waters is tremendously important for businesses like Tenaris. We and Algoma Steel also know that building bridges is good because they are going to use steel. Our housing plan, which was referenced in the speech, is also important. Doubling our housing is going to mean using Canadian wood, which will receive some preferential treatment. There are places throughout northern Ontario with mills, including in White River, where a mill was shuttered when Stephen Harper was prime minister. It reopened recently in partnership with first nations in the area, including Pic Mobert, and is now working. I am making the point that wood, steel and aluminum are all critically important for the most ambitious building project we have seen. How do we deal with the American administration? We fight, we protect and we build. Those are important things that we have to do. In doing so, we are not just creating jobs in steel, wood and aluminum; we are also creating jobs for our workers. As I mentioned, I used to be the apprenticeship guy in the Algoma region. I was pleased to see that we are supporting the growth of apprenticeships by covering the costs of apprentices with an up to $8,000 grant. That is tremendously important because there are costs associated—"
"Mr. Speaker, there were about 40 Liberal MPs between 2015 and 2019, including five ministers. That did not stop the Liberals from buying Trans Mountain, in spite of Quebec's environmental views. In the last Parliament, there were about 30 Liberal members from Quebec. That did not stop the Liberals from going against a unanimous motion from the National Assembly that called on the federal government to give Quebec its fair share for the dental care insurance program. Since the RAMQ was already administering part of that care, this would have allowed it to improve its own plan. The Liberal members let their government do as it pleased. How can we be sure that the 44 current members from Quebec will not continue to represent the government to Quebeckers instead of representing Quebeckers to the government?"
"I rise today to honor Mr. Arnoldo Moore on his retirement from the Social Security Administration after 30 years of distinguished service. Mr. Moore began his career in September 1994 as a Service Representative in Grand Rapids, Michigan, followed by assignments as both a Claims Representative and Management Support Specialist. In August 2003, Mr. Moore transitioned to Social Security Headquarters in Washington, D.C. serving as National Public Affairs Specialist, Human Resource Specialist, and Interactive Video Training (IVT) trainer, and Systems Analyst. While at headquarters, Mr. Moore was instrumental in developing and revising scripts for IVT broadcasts aired nationwide. He provided leadership and training to new employees on related programs. During his tenure in this role, Mr. Moore traveled the United States engaging with groups such as disability services organizations and Native American organizations. He prepared meetings for both the Commissioner and Acting Commissioner with White House staff to discuss Social Security Administration initiatives. From August 2003 through April 2025, Mr. Moore served in the Chattanooga, Tennessee Field Office as a Public Affairs Specialist. In this role, Mr. Moore has served as constituent liaison to my office providing outstanding service and support both to my district staff and to my constituents. Now, Arnoldo enters a new chapter in his life and is looking forward to spending more time with his wife, Yaritza, and his children, Aniza and Alejandro, while continuing to serve in our community. It is with great honor that I recognize Mr. Arnoldo Moore for his many years of public service to our Nation and our community, and I wish him well in all new endeavors as he begins his retirement."
"Yes, I am very happy to do that. I congratulate my hon. Friend on taking this campaign forward and on being such a worthy advocate for it. We take the issue very seriously and we are fully committed to implementing the Equipment Theft (Prevention) Act 2023. We are finalising our plans for commencement and we will update the House in due course."
"That is certainly what we are working to do. Because the two schemes are slightly different, the way the Treasury has to interact and think about these things is slightly different, but we have done this Government Actuary process, and we met the trustees today. We will now put our recommendation to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury--I know that a lot of my hon. Friends are talking to him about this issue whenever they can. While I have a desire to move at speed, I hope colleagues will appreciate that we also need to ensure that we get this absolutely right, and that any spending decisions are carefully considered, especially given the role that the Government have as the guarantor to both the mineworkers' pension scheme and the BCSSS. I want to assure all hon. Members that I am doing all I can to reach an agreement and improve the conditions for members as soon as possible."
"Mr. Speaker, not only do we know, but we actually have a plan. I am sure the member has heard the Prime Minister talk about a plan to make sure that we can continue to provide funding for important programs, such as the CDCP, and at the same time look at our operational spending and make those reductions and find those savings so we can continue to serve Canadians in the right way."
"I rise to speak to new clause 121, which is tabled in my name and supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Stamford (Alicia Kearns) and, I am very pleased to say, by Members from both sides of this Chamber. It would extend the definition of extreme pornography to include depictions of non-fatal strangulation, known as NFS. NFS was made a criminal offence in 2021 under the last Government, not because we think the Government should necessarily stick their nose into what people want to get up to in the bedroom, but because abusers use non-fatal strangulation without consent, as it leaves little visible injury and makes it hard to prosecute under domestic abuse cases. When a woman dies from strangulation, it is becoming increasingly common to use the defence that it was a sex game gone wrong. Non-fatal strangulation has a life out there in the world of online porn. As we know, the UK is a large porn consumer. In any given month, more than 10 million adults in the UK will access online porn, and the vast majority of them will be chaps. That is up to them--we do not judge--but we know from research that online porn is so widespread that one in 10 children have seen it by the age of nine. Unfortunately, it is the guide that many young people use to learn about sex. That is why I am extremely worried that non-fatal strangulation has been found to be rife on porn sites. Evidence has shown that it is directly influencing the sexual behaviour of young men, who are non-consensually strangling young women during consensual sex. Recent polling has suggested that 17% of 16 to 34-year-olds have been strangled without giving consent during consensual sex. We are not being prudes in calling for this misogynistic act to be banned in online porn. Health experts warn that there is no way to strangle someone without risk, given that blood and airflow may both be restricted. A person can become unconscious within 10 seconds of being choked, and within 17 seconds they can have a seizure due to lack of oxygen. Death can occur within 150 seconds of being rendered unconscious. Almost 20% of the women killed in the UK since 2014 were strangled by an intimate partner. Perpetrators who choke their partners are seven times more likely to kill them. I am sure the Minister will agree that it is alarming to hear reports of young men and boys seeking advice on how they can safely strangle their partner in bed and that girls are expected to accept that kind of behaviour. There was even a report last year, which the Minister may have heard about, of draft personal, social, health and economic education guidance from a Welsh local authority including safe choking during sex for a child sex education class. We need to send a signal that strangling your partner in bed is not safe--it can be a precursor to coercive, abusive behaviour. I know that the Government also want to send that signal, because in February they said, in their response to an independent review commissioned by the previous Government: ""The government will take urgent action to ensure pornography platforms, law enforcement and prosecutors are taking all necessary steps to tackle this increasingly prevalent harm."" I therefore urge the Minister to support my new clause 121, which sets out one of the necessary steps referred to in the Government's response. We need to back this amendment, ban this harmful practice, and send out a very strong message that depictions of non-fatal strangulation in porn normalise something that is not normal and is not safe."
"Mr. Speaker, in the absence of a budget, the main estimates came out last week, and they said there would be a 37% increase, to $26 billion a year. That will cost the average family about $1,400 in consultant fees. This is on top of the fact that the bureaucracy has grown almost 50% under the government. Does the hon. member not think there is a disconnect there, that we basically have a tax cut that is going to reduce the amount of taxes by the cost of a cup of coffee a week, yet on the back end of that, it is going to cost each Canadian family $1,400 a year for new consultants? Is that not a disconnect in her view?"
"what are we doing here? Seriously. I am still waiting for somebody to tell me how this makes sense. We are debating a budget that gives another round of tax cuts to billionaires and giant corporations on the backs of everyday Americans. And it also adds trillions of dollars to our national debt. That doesn't make any sense to me. And it doesn't make sense to the Arizonans that I have been hearing from in every corner of our State. If you grew up in a household like mine where money was tight, you would know that budgets are about priorities. I can still picture my mom sitting at the kitchen table trying to figure out which bills to pay. You take the money you have, and you put it where it is needed. This budget clearly tells the American people who President Trump and Republicans in Washington think need help. If you are a billionaire, it says: We have got your back. But if you are a parent trying to provide for your family, a senior in a nursing home, or a child who counts on school for your only hot meal, you are on your own. This isn't about balancing the books. It is about picking winners and letting everyone else fall behind. And who loses? It is the Americans working two jobs, raising kids, caring for elderly parents, and just trying to stay afloat, because if you grew up in a family like mine, you also know how hard people work to reach their American dream--the promise that if you work hard, your kids will get a good public education, you will be able to put food on the table, you will be able to go to the doctor and stay healthy, and your kids will be able to grow up and achieve their own American dream. This promise is already getting harder, and it is getting more expensive. We need to be working together across the aisle to ensure that everyone who works hard can have a brighter future. But that is not what my Republican colleagues are doing with this bill. The plan that they are jamming through right now will put the American dream out of reach for more families. And for what? To hand out more tax breaks to people with more wealth than they could spend in 10 lifetimes. Now, I have spent the last several months traveling across Arizona. I have been to our big cities Phoenix and Tucson. I have been to small towns like Clarkdale and Sierra Vista--talking to Arizonans face-to- face, listening to their stories, hearing what it would mean to them if Medicaid, food assistance, and other essential services got cut for them and their families. What I have heard is clear: This budget is going to make it harder for them to stay afloat, let alone get ahead. In Clarkdale, I met a guy named Christian. He is a rural hospital nephrologist. That is a kidney doctor. And he told me that his patients--many of whom rely on Medicaid for dialysis--are now considering stopping treatment altogether because they might not be able to afford it. He said:  Financially, none of the patients I serve can pay out of pocket. It's a choice of either massive debt or death.  That is the reality to many rural communities. Another woman told me about her friend, a survivor of two car accidents and a spinal injury. Her friend relies on Medicaid to help her deal with her chronic pain. Without it--meaning Medicaid--she said that her friend might end her life because the pain is unbearable. She asked me to deliver this message to my colleagues. She said:  This is not a country that can't afford to care for people like her. We can afford to care for everyone--if we change our priorities from giving tax cuts to billionaires to taking care of Americans who are in pain every day.  People across Arizona are pleading with us to get our priorities right. In Sierra Vista, I hosted a Medicaid townhall, and that is where I met this woman named Tara. She told us how she was once a single mother and how programs like Medicaid and SNAP helped her raise her kid and build a stable life. Today, she works a good job. She doesn't rely on these programs anymore, but here is what she said:  I'm deeply concerned about the proposed cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, and related programs. I know firsthand that they don't just help families--they're often the only path to stability.  Just last week, I was in Tucson where I live--where Gabby and I live--helping distribute school lunches at a local high school. It is actually the high school that my wife went to. And I wanted to see firsthand what these summer meal programs mean for Arizona families. These programs are funded through the United States Department of Agriculture, and they rely on data from SNAP and Medicaid to identify the children who need them the most. If this bill passes, a bunch of these kids that I served--I think it was last weekend--they won't be eligible for these programs anymore. It will be harder for them to access school meals which, I think we all know, compromises their academic performance. That is the real cost of this legislation. It is not numbers on a spreadsheet. It is hunger. It is illness. It is fear. It is a bunch of folks who work really hard doing everything right, and they are still going to get punched in the gut. And it is not just what I hear in person. My office gets hundreds of letters and phone calls every week from Arizonans. People are scared, and they want us to listen. I want to share some of their voices. Frank is a veteran on dialysis. He called this week, and he said:  The food bank and my SNAP benefits are the only way I eat right now. I can't work. I'm not old enough to retire, and I'm dipping into my retirement early just to keep up with my mortgage. Without this help, I don't know what I will do.  Veterans should never have to say those words in this country. One of the most sacred promises we make to the men and women who serve is that we will take care of them when they return home. That promise doesn't end when they hang up the uniform.  It includes making sure that they can afford food, access healthcare, and live with some dignity. And yet here is Frank--sick, struggling, and wondering how he will survive because the programs he relies on are under threat. Cheryl from Tucson, who is a 59-year-old widow, said:  I receive Disabled Widow's Benefits, Medicaid, Medicare, and SNAP.  Get this. She said:  My rent and utilities eat all but about $300 of my monthly income. SNAP and my healthcare card used to cover most of my food costs. I used to have about $40 left over to buy some extra groceries for the unsheltered in my area.  So here is a woman with $40 extra, and she is helping other people. She also says:  Now, buying food for my household takes all of it. I'm scared. If I lose even one of these benefits, I'll lose the grip that keeps the roof over my head.  Karen from Scottsdale has worked for over 25 years helping veterans and people with disabilities. She wrote:  Many of the people I work with rely on Medicaid because they can only work part-time or because their employers don't offer benefits. Cutting them off will just make healthcare more expensive for everyone. The rich do not need an extension on tax cuts at the expense of low-income and middle-class families.  These are my constituents. These are folks who, unprompted, took time to write or call their Senator. And every single one of them is saying the same thing: We are barely holding on, and we are scared this is going to put us over the edge. Now, I wish I could say that these stories were met with compassion by everybody here. But, instead, one of my Republican colleagues apparently said:  They'll get over it.  And another, when asked whether cutting Medicaid would cost lives, said:  Well, we are all going to die anyway.  Now, I didn't come here to throw jabs. I am repeating those words because they reveal how this budget was written without any connection to the real-world consequences. This isn't about politics. It is about people. So I ask again: What are we doing here? Who do we serve? Is it people like Tara and Cheryl and Crystal and Frank who are working hard and doing everything right to just try to get by? Or is it a bunch of billionaires who have already made it and who don't need another handout? If my colleagues don't believe me, I urge them to go read some of the emails and listen to some of the phone calls that they are getting. Maybe hold a townhall, listen to those folks, really listen to what they are saying. Don't crush their American dream. Don't rig the system even more against them. Don't take a vote just because it is easy. We can do better for the people we serve. Mr. President, they deserve that from us. I yield the floor."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the proud federal representative of the riding of Waterloo to speak on one of the most urgent and defining challenges of our time: the environment and climate change. As members of the Liberal Party, we understand that addressing climate change is not only an environmental imperative but a vital economic opportunity for communities like Waterloo and all Canadians. Waterloo is a dynamic riding, known for its innovation, education and growing industries, yet it faces pressing environmental challenges: urban growth, transportation emissions and the need for sustainable infrastructure. Waterloo, I believe, is the only riding in the country where the mayor of Waterloo, the member of provincial Parliament for Waterloo and my team, as the member of Parliament for Waterloo, are all located in one building. We are all located in Waterloo city hall. The environment sees no borders and demands a comprehensive response across all levels of government, the private sector, academia and civil society. Our government recognizes the realities of climate change. I would like to highlight some key federal investments that are supporting Waterloo's transition to a greener, more resilient future. Waterloo is a vibrant hub of innovation, education and industry. We are home to world-renowned institutions, like the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University; cutting-edge research facilities; and brilliant technology companies. In Waterloo, we are home to the Canadian Water Network, a hub for cross-sector collaboration to address Canada's water challenges and opportunities. It works with a wide range of organizations and individuals with diverse perspectives and expertise to solve today's complex water issues. The Canadian Water Network's partners and collaborators include government decision-makers, water managers, public health practitioners, community-based and indigenous organizations, and representatives from water-dependent economic sectors, among others. It is located in the University of Waterloo, in the riding of Waterloo, in the region of Waterloo. Waterloo is also home to Canada's first net-zero building, known as evolv1. Usually, office buildings are not energy-efficient, contributing to around one-third of greenhouse gas emissions globally. Originally, researchers found that zero-carbon buildings used more energy than predicted, yet evolv1 is a unique, modern, 104,000-square-foot urban space designed for today's millennial tech-savvy workforce. It is a three-story office building in Waterloo, Ontario. It was designed by architecture firm Stantec; built by Cora, a development company; and located on the doorstep of our Ion light rail transit. It showcases an array of amenities and creative collision spaces. Evolv1 offers a perfect, light-filled new home for today's growing tech or professional services companies and garners much international attention. It was imagined in partnership with Sustainable Waterloo Region and was certified LEED platinum. This building is a net-positive energy building, meaning it produces more energy than it consumes. It incorporates energy-efficient design features, including high-performance envelopes, solar arrays and geothermal systems. In Waterloo region alone, there are over 15,000 homes that were built prior to 1940, presenting a huge opportunity to take action. In Waterloo, we are part of the solution, and we turned a century home into a modern net-zero house, known as the Reep House. It has achieved an 86% reduction in energy use and a LEED for homes Canada platinum rating. At Reep Green Solutions, they believe that, acting today, we can leave our children a community that is more resilient, vibrant, caring and sustainable. Their mission is to empower the community with the practical tools, knowledge and capacity for action to make sustainable living the norm. Constituents within the region of Waterloo can contact Reep, and Reep will help inform them of any tax credits, grants or programs available across all levels of government. Today, the minister referenced several programs that are available to Canadians. Our community in Waterloo is poised to be a leader in the green economy. The blue box recycling system, a precursor to the modern recycling bin, was first developed and tested in the Waterloo region in 1981. In 1983, it was Kitchener, Ontario, that became the first community in Canada to include curbside recycling with blue bins in its waste management practices. I often say that as much as the world needs more Canada, Canada needs more Waterloo. We are part of the solution. We are a barn-raising community. We work together with like-minded and not-so-like-minded people, because we know that everyone must be part of the solution. However, to fully realize this potential, we require targeted investments. The federal government has been there for Waterloo with support that addresses the environmental challenges we face and leverages our local expertise. First is investment in public transit and sustainable transportation. We know transportation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. In Waterloo, we have seen significant federal funding directed toward expanding and electrifying public transit infrastructure. The Government of Canada has committed millions through programs like the public transit infrastructure fund, supporting the expansion of the Ion light rail transit system, a vital link, reducing traffic congestion and cutting emissions. This investment not only helps to lower our carbon footprint but also improves accessibility and connectivity for all residents, fostering inclusive and sustainable urban growth. It is an investment in cleaner air, less traffic and stronger communities. Second is support for clean energy innovation and green jobs. Waterloo's tech ecosystem is a hub for clean energy and environmental innovation. Our government has partnered with local institutions and businesses through initiatives such as Sustainable Development Technology Canada and the innovation superclusters initiative to fund cutting-edge projects in renewable energy, energy storage and smart grid technologies. These investments are creating good, well-paying green jobs right here at home, while positioning Canada as a leader in the global clean economy. This is exactly the kind of forward-thinking approach we need, tackling climate change while building economic prosperity. Third is enhancing natural climate solutions through conservation and green infrastructure. Federal funding has been allocated to protect and restore vital natural areas in and around Waterloo, including river corridors, wetlands and urban green spaces. These ecosystems act as carbon sinks, improve biodiversity and mitigate flooding risks, which are issues that are becoming more urgent as our climate changes. Programs such as the natural infrastructure fund and the Great Lakes protection initiative have supported local projects and enhanced water quality and habitat resilience, helping safeguard our environment for future generations. Fourth is climate adaptation and resilience. Waterloo is experiencing the impacts of climate change first-hand, from extreme weather events to shifting seasonal patterns. The government's investments in climate adaptation through infrastructure upgrades and community resilience programs are helping our riding better prepare for and withstand these challenges. Recent funding for flood mitigation projects and stormwater management systems exemplifies a proactive approach that protects both people and property, reducing costs over the long term and ensuring that Waterloo remains a safe and vibrant community. In closing, we have more work to do. The federal government's targeted investments in Waterloo exemplify our commitment to tackling climate change through practical, local solutions. These initiatives demonstrate that environmental stewardship and economic growth go together. By building cleaner transit, supporting innovation, protecting natural ecosystems and enhancing resilience, we are ensuring that Waterloo and all of Canada can thrive in a sustainable future. In my opportunity to exchange with the minister today, I would like to emphasize that we must continue to make decisions based on evidence, not ideology. Waterloo deserves and expects that. I am proud of the leadership we are showing as a government and the concrete steps the government is taking. Our community in Waterloo is home to some of Canada's most innovative research institutions, and local scientists are doing incredible work to fight climate change, protect biodiversity and improve air and water quality. I would like to know if the Minister of Environment and Climate Change can share how the federal government has supported these efforts in Waterloo through recent investments."
"Mr. Speaker, Parliament is demanding a budget from the Liberal government. Last night, a Conservative motion passed calling on the Prime Minister to table a budget this spring. The Liberals are asking Parliament to approve half a trillion dollars in Liberal spending with no budget. Despite promising to spend less and cap government spending at 2%, they have increased it by 8%. Single moms, seniors and small business owners must budget before they spend. Parliament wants the Liberals to do the same. Will the minority Liberal government listen to the majority in this House and table a budget immediately?"
"Mr. Speaker, as I have mentioned, other countries, like the countries of the EU and the U.K., are putting in place border carbon adjustments. Does it seem fair that the member opposite is suggesting we not diversify trade to those important countries? Does she want us to remain committed to only trading with the United States or does she want us to access those markets?"
"I thank my hon. Friend for that question, and I do find it slightly strange that Conservative Members seem to think that they are somehow now the upholders of parliamentary democracy and standards in Parliament. I am afraid that some of us have much longer memories. We are taking steps to raise standards, behaviour and the culture in this House, and indeed to make sure that the House is respected."
"Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate the member's tone tonight. During the last 10 years, we have seen the Trudeau government bring in policy after policy: Bill C-69 , Bill C-48 , the energy cap proposal and, on top of that, the energy regulations. We said at the time that the Liberals are making it difficult for private capital to form in the country for these big projects because of uncertainty. The new Liberal government has put forward Bill C-5 , which basically says that the whole system the Trudeau government put in place was completely over the top and has chased everything away. I know the member has talked about getting rid of some of these other things. Which would he prefer, Bill C-5 or for the government to address the awful regulatory environment created under the 10 years of the previous government?"
"I have already given a history lesson about some of those 14 years. When the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats were in the coalition together, we had a commitment, a promise and a cross-party agreement; the Conservatives then got into government by themselves and broke it, so we are where we are. We want to invest in social care, which is why we have announced the PS4 billion. We are seeing a very interesting alliance going on between our Green and Conservative colleagues; they agree on something, as we saw in the Lobby last week."
"I rise today to honor and congratulate the riders, roadies, staff, and organizers of the final AIDS/LifeCycle ride, a monumental journey from San Francisco to Los Angeles that has, for over two decades, raised critical funds and awareness in the fight against HIV and AIDS. This ride has never been just about the 545 miles; it has been about hope, remembrance, and action. With each pedal stroke, riders have carried forward the legacy of those lost to AIDS, stood in solidarity with those living with HIV, and worked to ensure a future where no one suffers from this disease. This year marks the end of an era. For 30 years, the San Francisco AIDS Foundation and the Los Angeles LGBT Center have partnered to organize this ride, and their leadership has transformed it into one of the world's most powerful displays of community, resilience, and compassion. Together, these two organizations have not only raised tens of millions of dollars, but have also provided direct services, prevention education, and lifesaving care to countless individuals across California and beyond. I was proud to join AIDS/LifeCycle first as a Congressman in 2014 and even prouder to join it as a U.S. Senator representing California. Each time, I was deeply moved by the strength, compassion, and unwavering commitment of the riders, roadies, staff, and volunteers who made this experience truly unforgettable. It was a privilege to ride alongside thousands who gave their time, energy, and hearts to this cause. To the riders who trained and sacrificed, to the roadies who made the journey possible, and to the countless volunteers and donors who fueled this mission: Thank you. You have made history. And your impact will be felt for generations. Though this may be the final 545 ride, the movement it inspired will continue. The spirit of AIDS/LifeCycle--one of unity, determination, and love--lives on in the ongoing fight for health equity, LGBTQ+ rights, and a future free of HIV."
I call the shadow Minister.
"I thank the Minister for his statement and for the support that he and his team have given my constituents and my team over the weekend. My city of Gloucester is in mourning for the loss of Akeel Nanabawa, Hannaa Vorajee and four-year-old Sara Nanabawa. I am sure the whole House will join us in sending our thoughts and prayers to their family and friends, and to the wider Barton and Tredworth community at this time. Understandably, the Indian authorities and hospital staff are overwhelmed by the scale of this tragedy, and I would be grateful if the Minister could outline what more we can do to support our constituents who have travelled to India to identify bodies and lay them to rest. He mentioned the support that has been given by Air India. Understandably, a number of my constituents who travelled to India at great personal expense over the weekend have real reservations about travelling with Air India at this time. Without wanting to sound alarmist, what support or financial assistance is being given to those who may have had to travel at great personal expense at very short notice?"
"Madam Speaker, what Conservatives support is real tax relief for Canadians, which would be to abolish, axe completely, the entire carbon tax. That would mean a real middle-class tax cut, not a tax cut that results in savings that work out to roughly a coffee per week, and it would include a real cut in terms of GST on new homes, not the watered-down version copied and pasted from our Conservative platform. Yes, we support relief for Canadians. They need it now, but this bill falls short."
"I welcome the ambition behind the Government's industrial strategy, a bold 10-year plan to unlock Britain's potential. Will the Minister outline how the strategy will align skills provision, particularly vocational and technical training, with the needs of our high-growth sectors such as advanced manufacturing and clean energy?"
"Mr. Speaker, let me be absolutely clear. We will never tolerate misconduct from our suppliers or their subcontractors, which is why we have taken legal action against GC Strategies. We have referred cases to the RCMP. We have barred them from contracting with the Canadian government. We have revoked their security clearance. This is the mandate we were elected on, to make sure that we have the best-in-class procurement system in this country."
"I rise today to honor the memory of the ``Lion of Lenox Avenue'', Congressman Charles B. Rangel. He was a friend, a mentor, and a champion for Harlem, New York City, and our Nation. Now, as most of us know, Charles B. Rangel was a titan, and my predecessor, who forged countless programs, trade agreements, and new initiatives during his 46 years in the U.S. House of Representatives. He became the urban voice, the voice of urban America. When America needed a compass, needed a direction for its urban cities, it was Charles B. Rangel that spoke truth to power and led the Nation forward. He was born in Harlem in the summer of 1930, right on the heels of the Great Depression, which cloaked the country in a blanket of poverty that spared no community. After dropping out of high school, Charles B. Rangel joined the U.S. Army's 503rd Field Artillery Battalion within the 2nd Infantry Division where he earned a Bronze Star with Valor and a Purple Heart after successfully leading his men through a mountain pass under attack by the Chinese army. After his return to the country, Rangel received his bachelor's degree from NYU and his law degree from St. John's University. He was appointed Assistant U.S. District Attorney in the Southern District of New York by no other than the U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. In 1970, he ascended to the House of Representatives where he and 12 other trailblazers formally founded the Congressional Black Caucus which slowly became the conscience of this House of Representatives, the conscience, of course, of Congress. He ultimately climbed to become the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, where he worked on legislation that would uplift working- class and middle-class families. This included the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and Empowerment Zones. His international impact was monumental. He forged trade agreements in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. He helped bring independence and economic prosperity across the globe. Informed by his military service, he became a lifelong champion for veterans, particularly those who faced discrimination upon their return to our Nation. Charles B. Rangel was a giant of a man. He was a legendary leader, not just for Harlem but for the rest of urban America. He held no grudge. He was a true gentleman, and one that chose to help everybody in the community. This week, our city will stop, our Nation will stop in silence to honor the life and legacy of the Lion of Lenox Avenue, Congressman Charles B. Rangel. May he rest in peace. May he rest in power."
"Mr. Chair, yes, the Quebec government received $750 million, not $750,000, for temporary housing for asylum seekers."
"Mr. Speaker, the strong borders act will crack down on organized crime, while making communities safer and providing the necessary guarantees to people who come to our borders and who are entitled to have their rights respected."
"The Minister comes to this House almost triumphant, having voted to take away winter fuel payments a minimum number of months before winter, and now says that we should be thanking him for this reinstatement. Anguish, anxiety, uncertainty--that is what my pensioners suffered. Will he apologise?"
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, once again, my Republican colleagues want to deflect on this issue focusing on undocumented immigrants. Undocumented immigrants are unlikely to vote in local D.C. elections. Again, why? It is because the D.C. voter roll is public record. Undocumented immigrants are not going to want to identify themselves, including their address, where they live. Noncitizen voting, again, this is consistent in a lot of jurisdictions across the entire country. We talked about 20 municipalities doing this to allow universal adult suffrage, the ability for people to take part in local elections. The other thing, really quick, that one of my Republican colleagues brought up that the purpose of this bill is to: ``Stop diluting the voices of American citizens.'' What is really diluting the voice of American citizens are voter suppression laws like we see in the South and like we see in Florida where I am from: poll taxes, voter roll purges, and voter intimidation. That is what is diluting the voice of American citizens. I haven't heard a single Republican in this debate talk about ensuring that citizens who live in D.C. can have full representation in Congress. Where is that? I bring it up again. In every issue Republicans want to talk about protecting us by taking away stuff from other people. They never want to talk about giving citizens what they deserve. The citizens of D.C. deserve to have full representation in the United States Congress. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"Again, I remind members to address their comments through the Chair. Questions and comments, the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton—Bkejwanong."
"Last year, the Secretary of State joined me on a visit to our vibrant high street in Pangbourne. I recently met the owner of one of those businesses, Nino's, a fantastic trattoria and deli. One issue that Nino raised with me was the regulatory burden on his business. How will the Government's small business strategy deal with that key challenge, and how will it support small businesses like Nino's, so that they can continue to thrive?"
"Mr. Speaker, the hon. parliamentary secretary made, in a throwaway comment, the claim that Canada Post's powers under the bill to open mail unilaterally would be subject to a warrant. I have studied the bill, and I even looked at it just after the member said that. The word “warrant” does not appear once in part 4 of the act, which deals with the powers of Canada Post. It says very clearly “the corporation”, referring to Canada Post. There is no reference to police, no reference to courts and no reference to warrants. Will the member please point to precisely where a warrant would be required for this authority?"
"I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's support and kind words. There is a great deal in the strategy that will benefit every part of the UK. He knows that I take my responsibilities for Northern Ireland very seriously, particularly given the complexities of trade policy, the Windsor agreement and how that has to work for the benefit of everyone in Northern Ireland. He will know that the UK has the lowest corporation tax of any G7 country, so it is quite an ask to reduce it still further. However, I understand the genuine competitive pressures of being in business in Northern Ireland for people who are close to the border, and how they are affected by the mobility of capital and talent. We all have a responsibility to work with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure UK Government policy works to the maximum, and provides consistent and co-ordinated benefits. I am regularly in touch with my colleagues in Northern Ireland and regularly visit. I am planning a visit right now--I might even look up the hon. Gentleman and make a visit to his constituency to address some of these issues."
"I rise today to celebrate six decades of the Aquarium of Niagara. An interactive water exhibit that celebrates the natural wonders of our aquatic world and provides a deeper educational understanding of our diverse ecosystems, the Aquarium is a gem of Western New York's cultural and educational institutions. The Aquarium of Niagara was one of the first of its kind. Founded in 1965 by a small group of chemists and scientists, it served as a successful model for inland aquariums around the world. Upon its opening, it became the first inland aquarium to develop and use artificial seawater to maintain exhibits; this sparked a revolutionary practice now used in most inland aquariums. Located in Niagara Falls, New York, the Aquarium of Niagara welcomes over 200,000 visitors each year and is the only aquatic museum within 250 miles of the United States. They serve as a hub for educating the community on aquatic life, consisting of two buildings and housing 180 species. Visitors come to see an array of mammals, penguins, and more than 1,200 fish and vertebrae, many of those being rescued species. Additionally, they provide guests with visual experiences to explore all of their marine life exhibits. There is a variety of scheduled programming offered daily as well as hands-on experiences that create inspiring opportunities for visitors. Today, we honor one of Western New York's one-of-a-kind establishments and its commitment to bringing the wonders of the seas to visitors from around the world while providing the highest quality of animal care possible. Please join me in celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Aquarium of Niagara and their achievements and continued success as they remain an enduring source of connection to marine life for generations to come."
"My constituent Owen Sutton is 26 and living with a rare brain tumour. He has undergone four major surgeries, had proton beam therapy, and suffers frequent seizures, but despite that, he has raised thousands of pounds, as well as awareness, as an incredible young ambassador for the Brain Tumour Charity. Owen and the charity are calling for a review of research funding, so could we have a statement from the Government on plans to better fund this vital, lifesaving research?"
"Mr. Speaker, I do not think anyone in Oakville West would think that going from absolutely crazy, insane levels of car theft to mucho, extra crazy levels of car theft is acceptable. The problem is that the Liberals are saying there was a drop, but it is still out of control. There are people in Oakville who have to buy bollards to put in front of their cars because their cars get stolen. The member talked about the detection of cars. The Liberal government cannot detect cars going out of a port. There is drone warfare happening, and we cannot even detect stolen cars in the port of Montreal."
"Here we are again. Once again, I would like to thank those in the other place who have worked so hard on these amendments, and indeed Members across the House who have stood up for creatives. We are back here again two weeks later to discuss and vote on Lords amendment 49F to secure the rights of creatives in the changing face of AI. What has changed in those two weeks? An awful lot actually. Forty eight hours before we voted on the amendment on 20 May, the latest big AI tech launch occurred when Google launched Veo 3--literally an all-talking, all-singing, all-dancing AI video creator, the like of which we have never seen before. Seeing is believing, and even when you see it, you will not always be able to believe that what you are seeing is not real. The emotions of the characters created by binary code, a series of zeros and ones, have already had me laughing, feeling and thinking; their jokes like a stand-up comedian, the light of the sunset comparable to standing at the Ashridge beech woods as a perfect day's golden hour arrives, the tangible fear of the binary character representing the actress, the director and the artist questioning what this means for them. The engineering, the development and, dare I say it, the creativity that has gone into developing such software is epic. There is no denying that, but I cannot help but wonder if all the value came from the engineering and the computing. What about the period dramas, the beauty of children's illustration, the wit of the one-liner and the fast-paced thrillers that have helped to train this cinematic experience at the touch of a prompt? As far as I can discover, Google representatives have previously mentioned that, as well as publicly available content, YouTube may have been used to train the model. I wonder how many must feel, seeing their creations replicated. Of course, this is just one example of the AI developments happening every minute. The alarm bell that creatives have been ringing has come to fruition a thousand times over. As much as I am sure that many creatives are excited about the possibilities, many will be questioning the implications for their industry, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. Just this afternoon, I spoke to creatives from the Creators' Rights Alliance, who have proof of their works being essentially copied against their will. Artists, writers, photographers, filmmakers, singers and songwriters are watching their life's work swallowed up. I have not even spoken about Lyria, which writes music, or the thousands of other developments coming out of AI--incredible developments that we must celebrate, but we must also ensure that the creative work that has  gone into it is also valued. While technology moves at pace, our frameworks for accountability have not kept up. In this moment, as artificial intelligence reshapes how creative works are used, adjusted and commercialised, the time for reflection is behind us. I appreciate the Government talking about protecting rights and the actions they are taking, but the time for real action is now. That is why I urge Members across the House to vote for Lords amendment 49F, to ensure transparency of business data is used in relation to AI models, a proportionate approach that calls to establish transparency. I urge the Government to also move at pace to protect creators' rights with a plan and with everyone around the table, something we have heard across the House today. As I walked around Little Gaddesden arts fair this weekend, I saw the bright colours and joy that had been created by Sally Bassett, Alison Bateson and Andrew Dixon. Right at the end of the road, Little Gaddesden village hall is where parts of ""The Crown"" were filmed. I thought of the legendary story about Picasso, which many Members may know. At a Parisian market, an admirer approached Picasso and asked if he could do a quick sketch on a napkin. He kindly obliged, creating art on the napkin. He handed it back to her, but not before asking for 1 million francs. ""But it only took you five minutes,"" barked the admirer. ""No,"" Picasso replied, ""it took me 40 years to be able to draw this in five minutes."" Given that prompts can create art, whether song, print, film or story, in seconds, who is being renumerated for the years of work that have gone into it? I urge Members across the House to vote for Lords amendment 49F. We must find a solution to ensure that human creativity is truly valued."
"I am grateful to the Minister for advance sight of his statement. As he said, the situation in the middle east and the suffering we see is serious and completely intolerable, and I reiterate what I said in response to the statement last week about this desperation and suffering being completely unacceptable. We continue to see violence, deaths and casualties, including near aid distribution centres, which is incomprehensible and should simply never happen. Britain has continued to leverage its influence with Israel and our international allies at every opportunity to change the course of the events that the world is witnessing--to ensure that the remaining hostages are released, that aid reaches those who need it and that a sustainable end to this conflict is achieved. We all want a better future for the Israeli and Palestinian people, and the UK must continue to play a leading role in achieving that. To do so, the UK needs to have constructive channels of communication open with all our partners in the region, as we work towards peace and an end to this conflict, and that includes dialogue with Israel. The sanctioning of individuals is always under review, which is the right policy, and in the case of Israel, that was previously considered by Lord Cameron, who spoke about it in the last Government. Will the Minister explain the timings of this decision, and can he give an assessment of the impact that the sanctions will have? I have read the Foreign Office statement on asset freezes,  travel bans and director disqualifications, and these measures will have the right effect only if we work with allies. The statement refers to action being taken with Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway. Can the Minister tell us what discussions he has had on this issue with other partners, including the United States of America, and their response? Given this decision and others that are being taken, can the Minister give his honest assessment of the UK Government's relationship with Israel? What direct communication have he and the Foreign Secretary had with Israel on securing the delivery of vital, lifesaving humanitarian aid to people in desperate need of help? As the Minister heard last week, the Opposition have been clear that settler violence is not helpful at all; it is taking things backwards when it comes to delivering the two-state solution. We again urge Israel not to take steps that could make the two-state solution even more difficult. We have consistently been committed to a two-state solution, delivered in the right way and at the right time, and we will work constructively to support every effort to achieve this. Can the Minister provide an update on the progress being made with the Palestinian Authority on reforms, following the memorandum of understanding that was signed in April? The House will understand that credible governance is needed for long-term stability in the west bank and Gaza, and of course, that means no future role for Hamas. More widely, the reports on the latest rounds of negotiations on hostage releases and bringing an end to the conflict are frustrating for us all; there has not been the progress that we all desperately want to see. Can the Minister provide an update on the direct discussions he is involved in, including with Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar and other allies in the region? The remaining hostages, held in captivity by the Iranian-backed terrorists, have faced over 600 days of suffering in horrific conditions, and securing their release continues to be critical to seeking an end to this conflict. We all want to see aid get into Gaza, to the innocent Palestinians who are suffering. We have discussed the need for vital food, medicines and shelter in previous statements, and I completely recognise and understand the difficulties associated with getting aid in. Can the Minister provide an update on the amount and types of aid that the UK continues to support and fund directly through partners, where that aid is, and the efforts to get it in? The House will know, as I said in response to the Minister's statement last week, that my noble friend Lord Cameron previously worked with the Israeli Government and with allies to secure aid, and to open up crossings and ports, and so increase the number of trucks and the volume of aid entering Gaza. Will the Minister confirm that, working with our partners, he has spoken to or presented a clear plan to Israel that supports more aid going in, and an increase in the volume of aid? Will we make use of our long-standing experience? Obviously, Britain leads the world on getting aid; we have expertise and a strong track record. Finally, will the Minister give an update on the actions being taken to restart dialogue and discussions on the viability of the Abraham accords, and on progress in delivering the Cairo plan? As the House knows, the Cairo  plan is important because it is backed by local and regional allies, and it gives the Egyptian Government a pivotal and vital role in securing peace in the region. Those are essential conditions that we need to meet to create peace, stability and a better future for Israel and Palestine."
"Although some projects in the Network North plan have been transferred over and continued, Aldridge train station was not one of them. It was funded through the city region sustainable transport settlement, so does my hon. Friend share my disappointment for my communities that it has been scrapped by Mayor Parker in the West Midlands?"
"Mr. Speaker, under the Liberals, Canadians are being forced to skip meals just to pay the rent. A new report from Royal LePage shows that 39% of Ontario renters are cutting back on food and essentials just to stay housed. Even the CMHC is waving the white flag, admitting its own housing targets are not possible under the Liberal government. This is what failure looks like: unaffordable housing, stalled construction and Canadians falling further behind. With alarm bells ringing all over the place, when will the Liberals finally admit that their housing plan isn't working?"
"I welcome what the hon. Lady said on Ukraine. She will recognise that this Government have been supported by all parties in the House in providing steadfast support to Ukraine to fight Putin's illegal invasion. She will also recognise that since this Government were elected in July, we stepped up the support for Ukraine. I hope that she will recognise that we have also stepped up the leadership that the UK can offer on European security more widely. As well as convening meetings, I chaired the first Ukraine support group meeting after 26 meetings in which the US had led the way. Alongside the French, we are convening the 30-odd nations that are looking at securing a long-term peace in Ukraine, if a ceasefire can be secured. This week at NATO, I will continue those discussions with Defence Ministers. The SDR is a vision for the next 10 years and beyond. It can be delivered within the spending commitments that this Government have made. As the Prime Minister underlined this morning, those spending commitments were baked into the terms of reference, and have been confirmed by the reviewers. As he has said, we will spend what we need to deliver this review, and I am totally confident that we will meet the ambition of 3% in the next Parliament. On military homes, the hon. Lady is right to mention the scandal, which has gone on for years, of making the families of those who serve live in substandard homes, which are often mouldy and damp, with leaking roofs and doors. We can change that, and we have acted to start to do that. This year, for the first time, we bought back family military homes, and we now control 36,000 of them. Last month, also for the first time, we set out a consumer charter, with the basics of what people can expect from the MOD as their landlord. We have also confirmed an extra PS1.5 billion over this Parliament to deal with the worst military family homes. We can start to develop for the long term, and build the homes that we need for our forces, and in the country more widely. We will be able to use better the huge asset that MOD land offers."
"Mr. Speaker, I will get an opportunity a bit later to add a lot more detail to what the member is stating, but I want to go back to something. The member's colleague posed a question to one of her colleagues from the Conservative Party, saying that GC Strategies came into being in 2015. Mr. Firth had a company, with a partner, that actually amalgamated into GC Strategies. Mr. Firth was involved in that company and received literally millions of dollars in contracts from Stephen Harper and Pierre Poilievre when Pierre Poilievre was part of the Stephen Harper government. I posed a legitimate question to the member's colleague, and his colleague even acknowledged that fact. Would the member still apply the same principles? If he agrees he would apply the same principles, does he believe that the House does have an obligation to look into Coredal, the same company that Mr. Firth was involved in?"
"I am now ready to rule on the questions of privilege raised on June 11 by the member for Mirabel and on June 13 by the member for Lakeland concerning allegedly misleading statements made in committee of the whole. The issues they brought forward relate to answers provided by the Minister of Finance and National Revenue during a meeting of the committee of the whole considering estimates on June 10 and by the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources on June 11, respectively. As both questions pertain to answers provided by ministers during their questioning on estimates, they have been grouped for the purpose of rendering a decision. In his intervention, the member for Mirabel alleged that the Minister of Finance and National Revenue intentionally misled the House by affirming in a response to a question that the Canada carbon rebate, issued as part of the federal carbon pollution pricing proceeds program during the election, was paid from funds collected by the program. He argued that the minister stated this, knowing that the timing of the Prime Minister 's announcement to suspend the consumer portion of the program, and the issuing of the rebate weeks later during the election campaign, suggests that a different source was used to fund the rebate. The Minister of Finance and National Revenue defended his response, denying having misled the House. According to the minister, he had responded in the negative to a question making an allusion to the buying of votes, not about the timing for the collection of funds. For her part, the member for Lakeland contended that the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources had misled the House in denying that politicians would be empowered to select specific projects of national interest under Bill C-5 , an act to enact the free trade and labour mobility in Canada act and the building Canada act. According to the member, several provisions of the bill seem to contradict the minister ’s responses, a text that he ought to have known. The member argued that the criteria used to determine whether a statement was deliberately misleading was met and that this situation amounted to contempt. Quoting from a ruling made by Speaker Rota on July 22, 2020, she ended her intervention by explaining the difficulties relating to questions of privilege arising in committees of the whole, due to their usual format as single-event bodies, which complicates the raising of such questions. In response to this second question of privilege, the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader provided a different interpretation of the exchange. He stated that the format of the committee of the whole is not designed to receive informed and contextualized answers. He argued that in no way did the minister deliberately mislead the House in responding to the member. The selection process in identifying projects will involve various consultations and will involve engagement with diverse groups. He apologized on behalf of the government for any confusion the debate may have caused. As this is my first ruling on a question of privilege, and for the benefit of the members newly elected to this place, I will ask for their indulgence in reiterating and explaining some key concepts. The Chair would like to first address what may seem to some as a technical element, namely, that the statements in question were made during proceedings in committee of the whole. When the House resolves itself into a committee of the whole, it is, for all intents and purposes, functioning as a committee to consider a matter the House has referred to it. In this regard, the practice for raising questions of privilege emanating from a committee of the whole is the same as that of a standing, special or legislative committee. As stated in House of Commons Procedure and Practice , third edition, at page 157: The Speaker will entertain a question of privilege in regard to a matter that occurred in a Committee of the Whole only if the matter has been dealt with first in the Committee of the Whole and reported accordingly to the House. It also says, at pages 933 and 934: The Chair [of the committee of the whole] has no authority to rule that a breach of privilege has occurred. The Chair hears the question of privilege and may receive and put a motion that certain events which occurred in the Committee should be reported to the House. If the Committee decides that the matter should be reported, then the Chair rises, the Speaker takes the Chair, and the Chair of the Committee reports the question of privilege. The Speaker then deals with the matter. If a prima facie case of privilege is found by the Speaker, a Member may move a motion dealing with the matter. In his July 22, 2020, ruling, found on pages 2701 and 2702 of the Debates, to which the member for Lakeland briefly referred in her intervention, Speaker Rota acknowledged the challenge surrounding the committee of the whole format. He also highlighted the particular nature of the situation he had been asked to adjudicate. A chronological review of events shows that this specific question of privilege had been first raised in committee of the whole and taken under advisement by the Speaker, who was also chairing the committee. It is also worth mentioning that an order of the House was limiting the committee's ability to consider and report on questions of privilege. These exceptional circumstances had led to Speaker Rota's decision to rule on the matter, even though no report had been presented by the committee of the whole. The Chair recognizes that there may sometimes be challenges with the committee of the whole format, in particular during the consideration of estimates. They, however, do not exempt members of their obligation to raise their concerns there first. The two cases presented last week by the members for Mirabel and Lakeland are no exception to this rule and are not akin to the 2020 precedent. That being said, the Chair nonetheless reviewed whether the specifics of the two present questions of privilege would warrant a deviation from our normal practice and considered the points raised by the members on their merits before discarding them on technical grounds. Accusing a member of having misled the House is quite serious as it may touch on their integrity. The threshold for determining if it constitutes a prima facie question of privilege is therefore very high. There must be little or no doubt left as to the validity of the claim made. The members for Mirabel and Lakeland rightfully referred to three criteria the Chair assesses when dealing with such allegations, namely, whether the statement is in fact misleading, whether the member making the statement knew it to be incorrect and, in making the statement, whether the member intended to mislead the House. Disagreements over facts, or how they are presented, are not uncommon in our proceedings, and members often believe that responses they receive from the government either are not correct or contradict other information they have. However, a perception of incorrect statements is not equal to a clear and deliberate intention to mislead the House. As Speaker Regan indicated on May 18, 2017, at page 11389 of the Debates: As members will know, the exchange of information in this place is constantly subject to varying and, yes, contradictory views and perceptions. This, of course, heightens the risk that, inadvertently, a member making a statement may be mistaken, or, in turn, that a member listening may misunderstand what another has stated. The Chair acknowledges the dissatisfaction members expressed about the responses they received in committee of the whole. After all, the consideration of estimates is an essential accountability exercise, but taking into account the explanations provided by the minister and the parliamentary secretary, there indeed seems to be a dispute as to the facts. If every disagreement is to be raised as a question of privilege, the House would spend its time doing little else. There are many opportunities in our debates for members to challenge each other on the facts of a particular case, and that is the correct way of dealing with such disagreements. For there to be a prima facie question of privilege, members must also present some evidence of a deliberate attempt to mislead. I have not seen any such evidence in this case. Furthermore, and before closing, as Speaker, I am bound to accepting members at their word, a long-standing tradition of this place. As one of my predecessors, the current Leader of the Opposition , indicated on April 29, 2015, at page 13198 of the Debates: as your Speaker, I must take all members at their word. To do otherwise, to take it upon myself to assess the truthfulness or accuracy of Members' statements is not a role which has been conferred on me, nor that the House has indicated that it would somehow wish the Chair to assume, with all of its implications. Accordingly, the Chair does not find there to be prima facie questions of privilege in either case. I thank all members for their attention."
"I am sorry to hear about what is happening to Harry, and I am sure we all want to wish him well in the treatment he needs to get. My hon. Friend is absolutely right that although state-of-the-art cancer treatments are available, they are not as widely available as they should be, and we have a lot further to go in ensuring that people are quickly treated near where they live. We will publish a dedicated national cancer plan this year, and I will ensure that the House is updated on that. We have already relaunched the children and young people cancer taskforce. I will absolutely look at the case he raises and see what further can be done."
"I rise today to celebrate the life of one of this body's greatest Members, the late Congressman Charlie Rangel of New York. There are few men anywhere who have made as large a mark on their community and their government as Charlie Rangel. Charlie Rangel led an extraordinary life. He was a decorated Korean war veteran, one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus, and the first Black American chairman of the storied Committee on Ways and Means. In his beloved community of Harlem, Charlie was a revered, legendary figure. He was loved by his constituents. He carved paths that others followed for decades. He was also an incredible dresser. In the long history of the U.S. House of Representatives, over 11,000 men and women have served in this Chamber. Of them, just nine served longer than Charlie Rangel. Mr. Speaker, Charlie Rangel's death has hit our community particularly hard, as his son-in-law Howard is the longtime leader of Eva's Village, which is a vital resource for our neighbors in the city of Paterson in my district. Last year, I had the pleasure of sitting with Congressman Rangel at a reception. Even at 94, he was full of energy, anecdotes, and stories, and he remained a sharp dresser. I send my condolences to Howard; his wife, Alicia Rangel Haughton; Steven Rangel; and Charlie Rangel's family."
"Questions and comments, the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot—Acton."
"Mr. Chair, again, we have tabled the levels plan. It is a levels plan that had been consulted on by provinces—"
"I think the country will hold to account those responsible for the absolute mess that this Government inherited. Nowhere in the right hon. Gentleman's question did he acknowledge that under the Government of which he was a member and for which he campaigned, prisons were brought to the brink of collapse. These reforms are necessary. This Government will not allow our prisons to run out of places--the one thing everybody agrees we cannot allow to happen. The only reason that is a possibility is because of the Tory party."
"The current system is broken, absolutely, but I do not think that hard-pressed planning officers are the problem. I think developers are the problem, and that is the point that I am coming on to make. Last year, less than 2% of new homes were social rents delivered through the planning system. Private developers prioritise maximum profit with high-end luxury builds, particularly in constituencies such as mine. At the current rate, we would need to build over 5 million homes to deliver just 90,000 social rent properties, yet there are over 1 million people on waiting lists. That is why I signed new clause 32 to introduce binding quotas for affordable and social rent homes. If we are serious, as I believe Labour is, about getting families out of temporary accommodation and off waiting lists, local authorities need the power and funding to lead a new generation of council house building. We also cannot ignore the fact that the developer-led model creates conflict with nature, as under-resourced councils are forced to accept whatever sites developers propose, regardless of how suitable or unsuitable they are for sustainable development. There is no amount of killing badgers or red tape bonfires that will fix that. It is too simplistic to argue that this is a debate of builders  versus blockers. The overwhelming majority of planning applications are approved, which is why we had more than a million planning permissions approved in the past decade that have yet to be built. Developers continue to drip feed developments into the system, prioritising properties that maximise profit and are far from affordable for local people. It is time, therefore, to move away from the failed market dogma and, I believe, to return to Labour values. The post-war Labour Government built millions of homes supported by the planning system our party created, and it is time we did it again."
"Madam Chair, I thank my colleague for her excellent speech. She truly gave us an overview of all the measures. She is an experienced colleague who has been serving the people of New Brunswick for a long time. I understand why the people of New Brunswick are proud to have her as their MP. She truly presented all the important things. She talked about the transfers we deliver to the provinces. She talked about the transfers we deliver to individuals. She also talked about national interest projects. She truly gave us a terrific economic overview of what is happening in Canada. She mentioned several things, but one thing really stands out. She talked about the tax cut for Canadians. Twenty-two million Canadians are going to benefit from it. I even see some of my Conservative colleagues smiling. They know that helping 22 million Canadians is important. We are lowering the first bracket from 15% to 14%. This is very important at a time like this, when people—"
"I am going to make some progress. However, it is most likely that these products are already licensed for other purposes. They could well be regulated through the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and within the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 for the purposes of the Bill, but it is important that time is given--"
"for many months now, we have been laying the groundwork for legislation to make tax relief for hard-working Americans permanent and invest in our security to build a stronger, safer, and more prosperous America, and we are very nearly there. It has been an exciting week in the Senate, with the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Armed Services Committee releasing their portions of the text. The text will come from the Commerce Committee and the Banking Committee very soon. I am grateful for the hard work of so many members and the committee chairs. This has been a deeply collaborative project from the get-go and the product of extensive work both within the Senate and between the Senate and the House. Between the good work of the House and the good work of the Senate, we are going to have an outstanding final bill. The bill text released this week by the Environment and Public Works and Armed Services Committees coversparts of the energy security and national defense sections of the final Senate bill. As I said on the floor yesterday, energy is the critical resource. Without a reliable energy supply, our homes, schools, hospitals, businesses, factories--our entire country--will literally grind to a halt. That includes our national security and national defense capabilities as well. A secure, stable, abundant energy supply is essential for our national defense, it is essential for our economy, and it is essential to keeping energy affordable for hard-working Americans. After 4 years of the Biden administration acting to constrain American energy production, our bill will help unleash American energy. It will suspend the Biden administration's natural gas tax, which threatened to both reduce supply and drive up energy prices for Americans. It will seek to end a key part of the Biden administration's electric vehicle mandate, which threatened to put a dangerous new burden on our already shaky electric grid. And more. Meanwhile, the defense section of the bill released this week by Chairman Wicker will promote peace through strength by reversing the trend of underinvestment in our military. With China beginning to outpace the United States in key defense capabilities and manufacturing, it is especially critical that we act now to prevent the United States from falling behind on the national security front. The defense title, while no substitute for robust yearly funding, will be a substantial step forward toward rebuilding our military to ensure that our service-members are equipped to deter or defeat any threat. Our bill will provide $29 billion for shipbuilding to build 13 new battle force ships, rapidly grow a fleet of unmanned vessels, and expand our maritime industrial base. It will provide $25 billion for the President's Golden Dome to defend the homeland from missiles, drones, and hypersonics, including accelerating capabilities for the Space Force and modernizing existing U.S. missile defense sensors and sites like those we have in Alaska. Our bill will provide $23 billion to expand advanced manufacturing capacity, restock critical munitions, and rebuild U.S. supply chains. It will provide $16 billion to develop and quickly field low-cost and next-generation weapons to arm our troops--weapons like drones, counter-drone capabilities, cheap munitions, AI capabilities, and a whole lot more, including expanding our Air Force fighter fleet and rebuilding our Pacific infrastructure. Our Nation will be safer and stronger because of the bill. I am grateful to Chairman Wicker, Chairman Capito, and all the Members both on and off of these committees who have invested so much time to produce this energy and defense language. It is exciting to see so many months of work coming to fruition. I look forward to the release of bill text coming from the Banking Committee and the Commerce Committee in the very near future and consideration of this bill on the floor in the coming weeks. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
"Mr. Speaker, I will not retract the word, calling the government “colonial”. I will not."
"My constituency of Sherwood Forest has the second largest BCSSS membership in the country. Almost 40% of the membership is women--women who were formerly employed in the mining industry, and women who were the spouses of members who have sadly died. Does the hon. Member agree that it is vital that the Government deliver justice for this scheme not only for constituencies such ours in Nottinghamshire but also for women?"
"Mr. Speaker, during the election, our platform stated that we were looking to reintroduce the $5,000 incentive for those purchases. We look forward to electric vehicle sales continuing to rise in the near future."
"That was a stream of slightly incoherent questions, if I may say so. I point the hon. Gentleman to the document that we have published today, which does mention Scotland quite a few times. He says that this Labour Government have not delivered anything for Scotland. I will just point him to the largest real-terms increase in funding since devolution began--his SNP  colleagues might want to think about how they could spend that more wisely for the people of Scotland. That is in addition to the supercomputer in Edinburgh; the development funding for Acorn, and for carbon capture, usage and storage; and our defence spending, including on the Clyde--I could go on and on. The only people in denial are those in the SNP."
"I thank the hon. Gentleman for welcoming, on behalf of his party, the commitment that the Chancellor has made and the extra funding that she has identified, but I think his party still opposes the way in which we have raised the funding to do just that. It is good to have your cake and eat it, but we are clear that the funding does come with reform. As I said in my statement, we are committed to improving the front door--primary care--as well as social care and discharge. That is why the NHS contribution, as part of the settlement to the better care fund, increases. He will be aware that we previously revised the better care fund to make it better and more targeted on discharge, which is important. The urgent and emergency care plan that we published a couple of weeks ago also confirms our recognition that flow through the hospital system is important for patients and staff; we must ensure that we do not face that continued crisis of corridor care over many years. We are committed to the fair pay agreement, and our colleagues in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government will make more statements in the coming weeks about how that will work."
"I hope my hon. Friend heard the point I made a moment ago about how the Government have brought forward this legislation in response to a recent Supreme Court decision. Essentially, an appeal against deprivation has resulted in a requirement for us to bring  forward this clarification of the law. In response to her and my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing Southall (Deirdre Costigan), this does not represent any widening of the existing arrangements. The right of appeal is completely unaffected by this legislation, which is incredibly narrowly drawn."
"I rise today to recognize Mr. Justin Thomas, Jr., a remarkable young man and proud Savannah native whose recent success and achievements have brought pride to the State of Georgia. As a graduate of Benedictine Military School in Savannah, Justin was a standout athlete who now plays center field for the Arkansas Razorbacks. Justin and the Razorbacks posted an impressive 50-win season, earning a trip to the College World Series. Even though Arkansas came up short of the program's first national title, Thomas' relentless hitting in clutch moments stood out. Justin was one of just two Razorbacks named to the all-tournament team, finishing the tournament with an impressive .571 batting average. His leadership, sportsmanship, and performance reflect the very best of what the city of Savannah stands for. Today, we celebrate Justin's achievement and look forward to his next incredible successes both on and off the field.  Recognizing Jamie Dupree"
"I rise today to recognize Kate Miller, the Executive Director of the Napa Valley Transportation Authority (NVTA). After 12 years of service at NVTA, Ms. Miller is retiring, ending her 30 year career in transportation and leaving behind a lasting impact on our Napa County community and the broader Bay Area. Born and raised in the Bay Area, Ms. Miller earned a Bachelor of Arts in U.S. and International Studies from the University of Washington and a Master's in Public Administration, Urban Studies, and Transportation from San Francisco State University. She began her career in transportation in 2000 at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, where she worked as a Senior Planner before moving to AC Transit as the Manager of Capital Development, Legislation, and Grants. In 2012, she became Executive Director of NVTA. Ms. Miller's leadership at NVTA has resulted in significant improvements to our Napa County's transportation infrastructure. She led the passage of Measure U, a sales tax expected to generate $1.2 billion over 30 years for local streets and road projects. Under her direction, NVTA completed the $56 million Soscol Junction Interchange, reducing traffic congestion and improving mobility. She also played a key role in expanding the Napa Valley Vine Trail, securing funding, and guiding its construction from Napa to Yountville and from Calistoga to St. Helena. Ms. Miller oversaw the operations of Vine Transit, which serves over 600,000 passengers annually and connects Napa County to Vallejo Ferry, Amtrak, and BART. During the 2017 Tubbs Fire, Vine Transit worked with emergency services to evacuate residents and visitors while maintaining limited bus service, earning NVTA and its partners the Bay Area Metro (Grand) Award from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in 2019. The agency later provided similar emergency response efforts during the 2020 Glass Fire. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Vine Transit also played a critical role by delivering meals to shelters and isolation sites, transporting high-risk individuals to quarantine facilities, assisting emergency staff, and ensuring access to testing and vaccination sites for those without transportation. Beyond our Napa Valley community, Ms. Miller has been a key voice in statewide transportation policy. She served as Chair of the Bay Area Partnership Board at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and was appointed to the California Transit Transformation Task Force, where she worked on long-term funding solutions and operational improvements for public transit. Ms. Miller is also a well-respected mentor, collaborator, and advocate for sustainable transportation. Known for her ability to bring together local governments, agencies, and private partners, she has strengthened Napa's position in regional and statewide transportation planning. Outside of her professional life, Ms. Miller is a dedicated family member and friend. She has been married to her husband, Greg, for 21 years and is a devoted aunt to her nieces and nephew Ashley, Natalie, and Wesley. A proud Napa resident, Ms. Miller is an cyclist and enjoys spending time with friends, sharing meals, and walking her dog, Lilly, through the streets of Browns Valley. Mr. Speaker, Ms. Miller's leadership has improved transportation infrastructure, expanded transit services, and advanced sustainability efforts in our Napa Valley and beyond. It is fitting and proper that we recognize her contributions here today."
"I thank the shadow Minister for his question. Let me take the case of the disused railway in my constituency. It is not in public ownership any more, and it is fragmented. We can fund as many feasibility studies as we want to invest in cycling infrastructure, but an incidental green space is not used by landowners at all. If we compulsorily purchased such land--obviously we would offer compensation--we could have high-quality cycling infrastructure that would link up villages to the major towns, so that people can attend GP appointments, schools and so on. The paths are also off-road--away from our gridlocked roads. Development must come with green and wild spaces, not just tarmac and bricks. That is why I strongly support new clause 114, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton and Wellington (Gideon Amos), which would ensure that development corporations include green space provision in all new developments. Green spaces are not a luxury; they are essential for mental health, biodiversity, wildlife, flood prevention and community cohesion. Like green spaces, playing fields and recreational facilities are fundamental for the development of grassroots sports and for youth opportunities, and therefore I support amendments 88 and 89 of my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Munira Wilson). We also need serious, measurable action on climate. Development corporations are being handed significant powers, yet the Bill fails to guarantee that they are delivering in line with the UK's climate targets. That is why amendment 151 is so important. It would ensure that the Secretary of State publishes a report on whether development corporations are meeting their legal duties on sustainable development and climate change. With so much at stake, we need transparency and accountability built into the system. Finally, we need new homes that are genuinely affordable, warm and built to high standards. In Stratford, many families and young people are priced out of their own community. It is not enough to build houses; we must build the right homes in the right places with the right infrastructure, green spaces and recreational and sports facilities that create communities. I urge the Government to back these amendments and take this opportunity to deliver a planning system that is fair, sustainable and community led."
"over the last few days, the country has been shocked by the horrifying images coming out of Los Angeles, but what is also shocking are the brazenly false statements made by the Governor of California. Governor Newsom has asked us not to believe our eyes, not to believe the scenes that we are all seeing of officers being attacked, of cars being lit on fire, of roadways being blocked. The Governor has claimed that everything was fine and that everything was perfect until the National Guard arrived. This is completely inaccurate, as a matter of the timeline. Things had spun out of control well before the Guard got there. That is why the Guard was called in. It is also deeply offensive to attack the men and women in our National Guard by claiming that their presence has somehow catalyzed this violence. The Governor owes an apology to the men and women in our National Guard who are serving our State and our country. He owes an apology to the people of Los Angeles for his role in egging on the riots. The good news, if there is any good news at all, is that I believe the people of California have had enough. There is a coalition for common sense emerging in our State, and I believe we will return sanity and safety to our communities."
"Colleagues, as we prepare to focus on our families and our constituents, I also want to take a moment to thank all those who have made it possible for us to do our work here in the House of Commons. On behalf of all members, I sincerely thank administration employees; our work would have ground to a halt without them. I thank the interpreters, the IT team, the maintenance staff, the clerks, the pages and the broadcasting team. I also thank the members of the Parliamentary Protective Service who show up every day to keep us safe. Their service is inspiring, and we appreciate them always. All of us, members and especially those who support them, have earned a break. I wish everyone a safe and restful summer and time to connect with their loved ones."
"Mr. Chair, the Liberal government is requesting over $800 million for an interim federal health program. This is up almost 15 times since 2017, and the asks keeps going up. Why?"
"Although she lives in Edinburgh South West, my constituent Amanda wrote to me about a power that English councils do not have when it comes to road safety, namely the power to deal with pavement parking. Is that something that the Minister has considered?"
"Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his clarification on the comment he made earlier. I would like to take this opportunity to remind my colleague that there are francophones across Canada, not just in Quebec. There are francophones in Ontario. My colleague asked me why members from Quebec are not speaking. Are francophones from outside Quebec not francophones? That is my question for my colleague."
"Mr. Chair, under the one Canadian economy act, we would be developing a major projects office. That major projects office would accelerate the process of getting critical mineral projects approved within a two-year time frame. We will also be negotiating bilateral agreements with each of the provinces so we can have “one project, one review” processes. These would all accelerate the development of critical mineral processes."
"The Secretary of State is in Singapore celebrating 60 years of diplomacy between our countries and drumming up investment, so I am afraid you have the deputies today, Mr Speaker. Access to high-speed internet is essential and we are determined to take everyone with us into the digital age. I am glad that 98% of people now have access to superfast speeds and 88% have gigabit. Our latest type C contract with Openreach is adding connections every single day."
"Mr. Chair, that is up to the Governor of the Bank of Canada."
"Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for her question. I apologize for the quality of my French. It is not very good, but I am learning. So far in this chamber, I have been very impressed with the Bloc's position on a number of issues: the environment, energy, development, health care and education. I think that, except for the whole leaving-the-country thing, we actually have quite a bit in common. It makes sense, because Ontario is quite similar to Quebec in many ways. The member talked about timber resources, aerospace and lumber. We also have many of the largest and strongest vibrant municipalities in Canada. We share common interests, so there are three things that come to mind that Ontario and Quebec could work together on. The first is expanding the definition of the energy sector. Conservatives are fixated on legacy fossil fuels, and I think Ontario and Quebec are more interested in clean next-generation electricity, mass timber construction and climate mitigation."
"Fourteen years of the Tories and 18 years of the SNP have left many Scottish high streets in desperate need of investment, including those in my constituency of Paisley and Renfrewshire South. I welcome the Chancellor's announcement today of investing in new community funds, bringing the total UK Government direct investment in Scottish local growth funding to almost PS1.7 billion. Will my right hon. Friend agree to come to Paisley to see why our high street deserves a slice of that very substantial pie."
"Mr. Chair, as I said, it is important to us to collaborate and respect the provinces. We respect the jurisdiction of every province, including Quebec—"
"Mr. Speaker, what we are talking about is how we can become an energy superpower. It will take access to low-cost, lower-risk energy that is either zero- or low-carbon."
"I rise to honor the 200th anniversary of the Log Inn, a Gibson County landmark located on the outskirts of Haubstadt, just north of Evansville, Indiana. This great restaurant put down its roots in 1825, and bore witness to Indiana's early growth, first as a trading post and a stagecoach stop between Evansville and Vincennes. On its bicentenary, the Log Inn is vaunted for hosting not just the Hoosier patrons that make up our community, but also importantly, Amenca's 16th Commander in Chief, President Abraham Lincoln. Furthermore, it once served as a stop on the Underground Railroad and is recognized as the oldest restaurant in Indiana. Today, this monumental testament to the incredible history of our community serves Hoosier families daily as they enjoy both the great history of the Log Inn, and the delicious food it provides. I celebrate the Log Inn for all its contnbutions to Indiana's 8th Congressional District, and I look forward to its continued success."
"One of the biggest challenges affecting the delivery of support for children with special educational needs and disabilities is the extent of local authority funding deficits. They are currently dealt with through the statutory override, which allows local authorities to set a balanced budget without accounting for their SEND deficits. Given that the statutory override expires in March 2026, does the Secretary of State agree that a White Paper in autumn 2025 provides far too little time for the Government to implement meaningful change without extending the override further, and when does she expect local authorities to be able to have the certainty that they need to plan for the coming financial year?"
"I was elected to this place on the back of a pledge to revitalise the towns in my constituency. With the high street in St Austell in a sorry state, I am delighted to have been able to take the first steps towards revitalising it by ending the impasse at the site of the now derelict General Wolfe pub and moving my constituency office back into town at the other end of the street. However, the fact remains that the high street is on its knees, and many residents feel that our once great town could do much better. What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that significant resources are available, beyond just the plan for neighbourhoods, to revitalise towns in constituencies like mine?"
"That is partly about the specification of need and the quantification of how we meet it. Government can be helpful in that. I first took an interest in the matter as a county councillor more than 30 years ago and then as a shadow Schools Minister more recently--some 20 years ago. The Government can provide support through guidance. Guidance can get right the specification of need, and some of the problem that the hon. Gentleman has described can be addressed."
"Mr. Speaker, will businesses receive direct compensation, yes or no?"
"Mr. Chair, the main estimates are a detailed document. I would suggest and ask my—"
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am listening to this debate, and we are not debating. We are just talking. Again, for the third time I am going to say: We support transparency. We support this information being made public if the Secretary so deems it to be made public in the interest of our national security. That is all we are saying. We are Members of Congress. We believe in transparency, accountability, and oversight. That is why folks on this side of the aisle are writing countless letters right now to the Secretary of Homeland Security demanding information so that we can do our job. That is transparency. I don't know when the last time was that my colleagues were at the border. I was just in San Ysidro a couple weeks ago. I can tell you I went to the secondary inspection. Fentanyl is still coming through that border. People were still breaking through that border. The fact is that border is not secure. That is why you have 2,000 U.S.border agents and 20,000 Mexican border agents trying to work on this issue. This opposition to this legislation is based on national security. We are saying if this is information that the author thinks is not sensitive, let the Secretary of Homeland Security make that decision to present it. This legislation isn't necessary. You don't want to mandate it. You want to let the anti-terrorist experts make that decision. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Ramirez), a leading member of the Committee on Homeland Security."
I will take the question of privilege under advisement. The hon. member for Mégantic—L'Érable—Lotbinière.
"My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the importance of technology. I said in my opening remarks that the investments that we made in the spending review, which did not fall from the sky but came about because of choices made by the Government, contribute to the strength and resilience of the country. That is why the strategy talks of three pillars--homeland security, alliances abroad and deepening our sovereign capabilities--and all three are important."
I will happily do so if the hon. Gentleman will apologise for 14 years of chaos.
"Mr. Chair, unemployment is rising across Canada. According to some experts, there will be approximately 100,000 job losses by the fall. However, you keep increasing immigration. Why do you insist on pushing newcomers into unemployment?"
"Mr. Speaker, an affordability crisis has been led by the government for decades now. We see what has happened to our economy and our nation. Canadians are struggling. If we point our finger at affordable housing, we do not have any. If we point our finger at the resources, we are not using them. I would say that we need to do is put Canadians first and Canada first."
"Mr. Speaker, I just wish the member had been in Saskatoon recently. He would have seen that there is unity in this country like we have never seen before. People want to build. They want to make sure our resources go to market. That should have been a moment celebrated by all Conservatives. I know many of the western premiers, who text me quite often. They want to make sure that we build things together, and we are quite happy to build with them."
"Yes, I wholeheartedly agree. Amendment 69 also mandates that improvements be delivered before harm occurs. Without that, we risk species being pushed closer to extinction before their habitats are replaced. Worst of all, the Bill still will not deliver the affordable homes we desperately need."
"Every child deserves the opportunity to achieve and thrive in education. That is why this Government have--as Labour Governments always do--prioritised education, with the Department's budget for day-to-day cash spending increasing by almost PS6 billion compared with the last financial year. Within that, we have increased the overall core schools budget by PS3.7 billion in 2025-26 compared with last year. This real-terms increase in funding per pupil helps underpin our ambition of achieving high and rising standards for all children in all our schools. This investment of PS3.7 billion in 2025-26 includes both the PS2.3 billion announced at the October Budget, and the PS1.4 billion in additional funding being provided to support schools with staff pay awards and with the increases to employer national insurance contributions from April 2025. The majority of school funding is allocated through the schools national funding formula. In 2025-26, PS5.1 billion of the schools NFF has been allocated through deprivation factors, and PS8.6 billion will be allocated for additional needs overall--that is, over PS1 in every PS6 of total core funding through the formula being directed towards the schools facing the most challenging cohorts. The spending review builds on this investment in schools. Across the spending review period, core schools funding--including SEND investment, which I know is a big issue for many Members who have spoken --will increase from PS65.3 billion in 2025-26 to PS69.5 billion by 2028-29. I turn to the SEND system, which many Members have spoken passionately about. It is, and has been for too long, on its knees. This Government are determined to face up to the facts: too many families and children are simply not receiving the quality of SEND services and provision that they should expect; they are having to fight for those services; and they are having to wait too long before those services are made available. It is this Government's ambition for all children and young people with SEND to receive the right support at the right time, so that they can succeed in their education and in moving into adult life. To help us achieve that, we have invested PS1 billion more in funding for high needs in 2025-26 than in 2024-25. We are also providing PS740 million of high-needs capital funding in 2025-26, so that local authorities can adapt schools to be more accessible and can build new places, including in specialist facilities within mainstream schools. More than 1.7 million children and young people in England have special educational needs, and the vast majority of those are educated in mainstream settings. We are committed to improving inclusivity, to bringing a new focus on expertise in mainstream settings, and to an inclusive curriculum, so that the vast majority of children can be well supported in mainstream settings, with specialist settings catering to those with the most complex needs."
"I was necessarily absent from rollcall vote No. 297, confirmation of Brett Shumate, of Virginia, to be an Assistant Attorney General. Had I been present for the vote I would have voted nay. I was necessarily absent from rollcall vote No. 298, the motion to invoke cloture on David Fotouhi to be Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Had I been present for the vote I would have voted nay. I was necessarily absent from rollcall vote No. 299, confirmation of David Fotouhi to be Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Had I been present for the vote I would have voted nay."
"The Prime Minister clearly has selective amnesia. I asked him three questions about the winter fuel payment two weeks ago and he was floundering. The fact is he has not answered the question I asked him; he cannot tell us who will get the payments. All we see is U-turn after U-turn--his head must be spinning. Will he apologise now, including to his own Back Benchers, for taking the payments away in the first place? Can he tell us how he will pay for this?"
"had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 147.  Personal Explanation"
"Mr. Speaker, I think Canadians spoke loud and clear in electing members of this side of the House to deliver on housing. This government, our new government, has put forward the most aggressive plan to build affordable housing this country has ever seen, and it starts today with a break on GST for new homebuyers."
I cannot say precisely whether any of the 100 companies that are UK-based suppliers on this programme are in my hon. Friend's constituency or his region--I will have to go away and look it up--but I do know that these procurements spread prosperity around all regions and nations of the UK. That is one great thing about the defence industry: it provides jobs and growth across the UK.
"Across Keighley and Ilkley, there are many fantastic independent businesses that rely on footfall for customers to come through their doors. However, after hiking parking charges in Ilkley earlier this year, Labour-run Bradford council has now decided to strip away our free one hour on-street parking from the town centre and, quite rightly, local businesses and residents are up in arms. On top of the whopping 10% increase in council tax and increases in business rates, Bradford council is now scrapping free car parking, so does the Leader of the House feel that will be to the detriment of our many businesses and residents across the constituency?"
"The Wild Justice ""Lost Nature"" report, which was produced by a team including my excellent constituent Sarah Postlethwaite, reveals that housing developers are frequently failing on  their legally binding ecological commitments. Its survey of 42 new housing developments, including two in my constituency, shows that only half the ecological enhancements promised, including hedgehog highways, bird boxes, bat boxes and planted trees, were actually being delivered. Does my hon. Friend agree that, while trusting developers' promises, we must take up-front steps to empower and expand Natural England and other authorities to hold them to account?"
"The two sanctioned Ministers have been enabled by Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is himself subject to an International Criminal Court arrest warrant, and I wonder what the Government will do to make sure that that is properly pursued. When I was in the west bank only a week after the two Labour Members were shamefully deported, it was very clear that the settlements are taking over. What sanctions will the Government take to ensure that there is no trade with those settlements?"
"As a pharmacist, I should say that the drugs to be used for assisted dying are commonly used in pharmacy now. It would be obvious for pharmacies to supply those drugs in some way, shape or form. I accept the hon. Member's point about medicines being used, but he will, I hope, accept my point: how would the same studies used to approve treatments be used to approve their use for death?"
"In Aylesbury town centre, we have some fantastic businesses, from Darlington's to the Rockwood pub and Nafees bakery. They provide an amazing service to the community, but with issues such as traffic, parking and antisocial behaviour, they can struggle to get customers into town and through their doors. I congratulate the Minister on the work he is doing, but can he tell us more about how his small business strategy will support our high streets and town centres, like Aylesbury, to thrive?"
"Mr. Chair, for discharge with intent, or drive-by shootings, someone can now get house arrest, and there is no mandatory minimum. The minister voted for that. Does he regret that, given gun violence today?"
Agreed.
"Mr. Speaker, this is a banker turned Prime Minister who, when pressed about his lack of transparency, shuts us down, saying that he understands the issue, that he would not be in politics if not for the crisis and that he is going to do what it takes to get all workers and families through the crisis. This is not a normal situation. We can all agree on that. It would have been great if we could at least have had an economic statement to help us understand how we can reduce taxes and balance the budget in three years, while helping businesses, families and workers without the revenue from the retaliatory tariffs. That is a magic wand. Does she know what the banker Prime Minister's magic wand is?"
My hon. Friend sets out the principle case for means-testing the winter fuel payment very well indeed. I do not think that anybody with common sense thinks it right that millionaires receive each year from the Exchequer hundreds of pounds towards their winter fuel payments--people have recognised that for years. The Government are making the tough choice of saying that that we will no longer pay the winter fuel payment in that way.
"Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House, we agree that home buying and making it more affordable, especially for young families, are very important. I believe that might have been an idea from this side of the House, but we do not mind when our good ideas are taken from that side of the House. With this bill, the number quoted is roughly $800 per year. If we talk to the average family and really do the math, is a weekly stop at Timmy's or Starbucks going to make a difference in their lives? I think most Canadian families, especially those in my riding, are going to say no. I would like to see more breaks for families and affordability taken more seriously."
"The spending review announced increases in NHS spending alongside more money for adult social care. By investing in DEXA scanners, we can more rapidly treat conditions such as osteoporosis, which particularly affect elderly women. Our urgent and emergency care plan promotes falls prevention technology for longer independent living and fewer hospital admissions. GPs are now incentivised to improve continuity of care, benefiting patients with long-term conditions."
"Mr. Speaker, misconduct of any kind in our procurement process is completely unacceptable. That is exactly why we have acted on this matter and ensured there is an investigation. The company in question is no longer eligible to enter into contracts with the federal government. The matter has been referred to the RCMP. Legal action is ongoing."
"Yes, that is in Staffordshire, as my hon. Friend says. There are factories in Newcastle-under-Lyme as well. We are, however, seeing a proliferation of companies that seek to pass off material not made in the UK. Its firing will have taken place overseas and it will then be imported into the UK, with the decorating and final glost firing or hand-decorating stage happening in the UK, and with simply the word ""England"" put on to it. That way, the consumer thinks that the thing they are buying is a UK-made product, when in fact it is not. There are many great companies in Stoke-on-Trent, which I know hon. Friends will reference in their speeches. I will speak briefly of Duchess, Churchill, Steelite, Emma Bridgewater and the companies that proudly put ""Made in England"" on the back of their products, because everything they do is made in England. The clay is first moulded, first fired, glazed, decorated, second fired and sold in the UK. It is a genuinely British product, and there is value in that product. We know from the export markets to South Korea and America, in particular, that those customers want to buy products that are made in the UK. There are some companies that quite honestly import from overseas and they are very clear about that. Plates made by some companies in my constituency, such as Portmeirion, quite clearly state that they have been made in China, but they sit alongside products made in the UK. The company is very up front about that; it does not seem to hide it or to try to confuse the consumer. It is clear about the fact that it imports some of its ware from overseas. Some companies, however, simply seek to put the word ""England"" on the back of their products. That will be because the company is probably English registered, or it is one of the UK's historical brands that have a long affinity with Stoke-on-Trent, even if the manufacturing processes no longer takes place there. A consumer will turn that product over and see the name of one of our historical companies and a date, normally from the 1700s or 1800s, and they will see the word ""England"" underneath it. It is completely and utterly understandable for them to look at that and think, ""This is a product made in England"", but often it is not. New clause 1 asks the Government to come forward with an investigation to consider whether there is merit in protecting things that are made in the UK by having that country of origin stamp, specifically for ceramics. I know that the Liberal Democrats have tabled a similar amendment today that would do this for a whole host of products. I am glad that we are using similar language on this, because whether it is food or any other products unrelated to ceramics, if they have been made in the UK they should clearly say so. My new clause specifically  looks at ceramics, and I will not deviate into the speech that I am sure will come from the Liberal Democrat Benches. Another aspect that the Minister graciously made time to discuss yesterday is the companies, particularly Chinese companies, that now seek to copy the backstamp. We have some great examples from a company called Dunoon in Staffordshire that makes excellent ware. If a consumer buys an item from the company's shops, it will have ""Made in the UK"" written on the bottom, and little stickers on it that say ""Made in the UK"". I have in my office some Chinese copies that have copied the ""Made in the UK"" sticker and the ""Made in the UK"" backstamp. These are sold through drop-shipping companies online, so tracing where they actually come from is very difficult. Any consumer who collects that sort of material would be forgiven for thinking that they were buying something online that had been made in the UK. It will have a ""Made in the UK"" backstamp and sticker, and all the design elements match almost perfectly the ones that are made in the UK, but the consumer will have no idea where it was made. They will also have no idea whether there are elements of mercury and cadmium in the glaze that has been used, whether the pigments used to decorate it meet the standards we have in the UK, or whether it meets the food contact regulations that are required in the UK for items used for drinking or eating off. The consumer will have no idea about the quality of the clay, or what has been added to the clay before firing. Sometimes, in products that are imported into the UK from less good manufacturers, the clay will have been mixed with material that can have a harmful effect on the consumer. New clause 1 simply asks the Government to consider the merits of a country of origin marking scheme for ceramics. It does not commit the Government to bringing forward such a scheme. I have a ten-minute rule Bill, which is currently waiting for a free Friday, when it can get an airing and we can discuss that in more detail. This is about trying to establish the principle that there are things that are made in the UK that we value, and that if we know they have value because they are made in the UK, we should do all we can to try and protect that."
"I rise today to recognize and commend the Grand Gulf Nuclear Station in Port Gibson, MS, on the occasion of its 40th anniversary of commercial operation. As the largest single-unit nuclear power reactor in the United States, Grand Gulf stands as a pillar of reliable and resilient nuclear energy production, for Mississippi and for the entire region. Since beginning operations on July 1, 1985, Grand Gulf has delivered nearly 1,500 megawatts of carbon-free electricity, enough to power over 800,000 homes. It is the only nuclear power plant in the State and currently supplies approximately 16 percent of Mississippi's total power generation. Its legacy is not only measured in megawatts but also in its role as a driver of economic development, technological excellence, and environmental stewardship. Grand Gulf's contributions to Mississippi's economy are substantial. The plant pays nearly $30 million in State and local taxes annually and brings in an additional 800 skilled contractors during routine maintenance and refueling periods--supporting local jobs and businesses. The Mississippi State Senate recently passed a resolution honoring Grand Gulf for its sustained service and economic impact to the State of Mississippi. At the heart of Grand Gulf's success are its people. I would like to recognize the team of over 750 highly trained nuclear professionals that operate and service the plant. Grand Gulf's team has cultivated a culture of safety, continuous improvement, and community service. The station maintains some of the highest safety standards in the industry, with redundant safety systems and rigorous employee training. Beyond its critical energy mission, Grand Gulf is also a valued community partner. In 2023, the plant donated more than $120,000 to local causes and logged nearly 4,000 hours of volunteer service. In 2024, more than 1,600 students visited the station to learn about careers in nuclear energy, opening doors for the next generation of skilled professionals.  In an era when reliable, resilient, and emissions-free electricity is more critical than ever, Grand Gulf continues to lead by example. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Grand Gulf team on 40 years of excellence and thanking them for their enduring service to Mississippi, our communities, and the Nation."
"Mr. Chair, as I have indicated earlier, this is not a bail reform bill. It is a border bill."
"I thank the Secretary of State for his statement. The role of the IRGC in life in Iran over the years has been human rights abuses, religious freedom abuses and gender abuses, with acts of global extremism and terrorism often having their roots and support in Iran. The war in Israel is a prime example of that. Anyone who pretends that Iran, with its nuclear potential, is in any way an innocent bystander is being deliberately dishonest. Will the Foreign Secretary commit again to working with allies, such as the US, to minimise bloodshed and ensure that Israel is able to remain safe and free from all attacks?"
"I missed votes because of an important family matter. Had I been present, I would have voted NAY on Roll Call No. 183 and NAY on Roll Call No. 184.  Personal Explanation"
"There is no long-term vision. Torfaen council has voted unanimously to devolve the Crown Estate to Wales, which means that every local authority in Wales, including every Labour-run council, supports the policy. Does the Secretary of State really believe that the UK Labour Government know better than the entirety of Welsh local government? When Wales speaks with one voice, isn't it time that Wales's voice in the Cabinet says the same thing?"
"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am sure colleagues across the House are extremely proud of our armed forces. Does the Minister agree that this Bill is an opportunity for us to show a united Chamber in support of our armed forces and that colleagues should support it?"
"Does my hon. Friend agree that in rural constituencies like mine, bus routes are an absolute lifeline and a route out of poverty? When the 84 and 85 bus route was cut last year, it meant not only that people could not get to medical appointments or to work, but that students had to drop out of the college courses that would have enabled them to escape from poverty. Does my hon. Friend agree that we need to make sure that this Bill enables an affordable, joined-up and genuinely useful rural transport network?"
"Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. We now know undoubtedly that The Sunday Times was given access to the White Paper, because people could read most of it in The Sunday Times the day before Parliament saw it, although crucially the article did not mention up to 12 new SSNs--nuclear-powered attack submarines. I will explain in a quick second why that is important, Mr Speaker. At 10.30 on the Monday morning, journalists were invited to a reading room in Horse Guards Parade, where they were given access to the White Paper. Section 8.11 of the ""Ministerial Code"" clearly states: ""where commercially sensitive material is involved, no copies should be made available to the media before publication."" Thus, that was clearly a breach of the code. However, there was an earlier sitting in the reading room, at 8 am, when we know the White Paper was also seen by members of defence companies, trade associations, academics, think-tanks and trade unionists, at the same  time that the markets were opening. Mr Speaker, there is a possibility of insider trading. The share price of Babcock, which would benefit from maintaining SSNs, leapt very early on after 8 am--"
"I do not need to add anything to my opening speech, because the inevitable gaps have been filled eloquently by the subsequent speakers. Let me just take two minutes to thank those who have contributed to the debate. I thank the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Sir Ashley Fox), my hon. Friends the Members for Colchester (Pam Cox) and for Amber Valley (Linsey Farnsworth), the hon. Member for Wells and Mendip Hills (Tessa Munt), the hon. Member for Solihull West and Shirley (Dr Shastri-Hurst) and the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Josh Babarinde). They are all members of the Justice Committee, although the hon. Member for Eastbourne was wearing his other hat today as the Liberal Democrat spokesperson, and I thank them for being here today. Indeed, I thank all the Committee members. With the exception of the hon. Member for Wells and Mendip Hills, who resumed a distinguished parliamentary career after a short gap, they are all new Members, and they all give a great deal of time to this role in addition to everything else that new Members have to do. I also thank the other Members who have spoken. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth East (Tom Hayes) for his forensic dissection of the last Government's failings in this area, and I thank, in particular, my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool Riverside (Kim Johnson), who covered ground that I did not have time to cover in relation to the Criminal Cases Review Commission and miscarriages of justice. I am grateful for her work in chairing the all-party parliamentary group for miscarriages of justice, as I am to my hon. Friend the Member for Derby North (Catherine Atkinson)--who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on access to justice--for her work on that and to other APPGs in this field. I even thank the Front Benchers for their contributions. The hon. Member for Eastbourne is always very critical but very constructive. Perhaps the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Dr Mullan) would like to adopt that approach."
"As usual, I agree with much of what the Foreign Secretary has to say, but I have to ask him this: how many times must a terrorist-funding, fanatical regime threaten to wipe another country from the face of the earth before a Government advised by Lord Hermer of Chagos acknowledge that military action to delay and degrade its nuclear weapons programme is both ethically and legally justifiable?"
"Mr. Speaker, the question has already been asked of my colleague across the way, but unfortunately, I do not think he understood it. I will repeat it slowly. Will the government take steps to recover the money stolen from Quebeckers and Canadians?"
"Mr. Speaker, I may not have understood the question, but it seems the hon. member did not understand the answer either. We have forwarded all the information to the RCMP, and we have set up an office that will be responsible for verifying compliance and determining whether additional action should be taken. We cannot do more, because any further action would be political interference."
"I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his point of order and for notice of it. He has put his point on the record, and I am sure his concerns will have been heard by those on the Treasury Bench."
"Wachiya , Mr. Speaker. [ Member spoke in Cree ] [ English ] It is my pleasure to congratulate you on winning this seat and representing us as the Speaker in the House. It is a privilege to speak for the first time in the House as the member for Abitibi—Baie‑James—Nunavik—Eeyou. I would like to sincerely thank the residents of my riding for allowing me to represent them in the House. It is also an honour to rise as the first Minister of Indigenous Services who is herself indigenous, a bold and historic move by our Prime Minister in the formation of his cabinet. I want to also acknowledge my colleagues from the indigenous caucus for coming to support this important debate tonight. I rise in this House with a deep sense of urgency and responsibility. Across Canada, wildfires are presently burning. They are threatening lives, homes and entire communities. These fires are not isolated events; they are part of a growing pattern, yes, driven by climate change. They are affecting more and more people more frequently and more severely than ever before. I want to acknowledge the profound impacts the wildfires have had on individuals, families and communities. To those who have lost their homes, who have been forced to evacuate, and who are living with uncertainty and fear, I extend my deepest sympathies. [ Member spoke in Cree ] [ English ] I am thinking of everyone. I want to also share that my ministry has been in close communication with many chiefs and first nation leaders. We have been supporting these communities through these challenging times, working around the clock to keep people safe and securing them in an ever-changing situation. Sometimes I receive calls from leadership who have been on the front lines fighting fires themselves. I want to acknowledge their leadership and courage. To support their evacuations, Indigenous Services Canada has first ensured that we provide advance payments to first nations communities. These funds help to ensure that communities have the resources they need when they need them in critical moments. This approach is proactive. It is necessary. When communities are given the right tools and resources to act swiftly, lives are protected and damage is minimized. The ministry is working alongside first nations partners, as well as provincial and territorial counterparts, to monitor and to ensure that we respond rapidly to ever-evolving fire situations. I am in near-constant communication with my federal colleagues, such as the Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience . We have spoken with our provincial counterparts over the last few days. I want to commend the minister for her support, open communication and response to urgency when I called upon her at all hours of the night. I also want to acknowledge the many leaders who have spoken with me. Chief Waylon Scott is one of the chiefs I have had the opportunity to speak with recently, and he offered a quote to be shared as part of the debate this evening: [Our] nation has been evacuated for some time now due to wildfires in Northern Ontario. The new Minister of Indigenous Services directed her team reach out to me directly, and they have been available and supportive throughout this emergency. I, Chief Scott, Ontario Regional Chief Benedict, and other Ontario Chiefs affected by the wildfires also met with the Minister virtually. Their situation, their needs and the best way to support their response were reflected in how our team, on numerous occasions, day and night, responded to the community and community members. During this crisis, the Government of Canada has been a strong partner for first nations across Ontario, and we are proactive in reaching out to all provinces. This partnership reflects our shared responsibility. No single government or organization can face this challenge alone. It is through unity and mutual respect that we find the most effective solutions. The emergency management assistance program, under Indigenous Services Canada, reimburses eligible costs related to wildfire response and recovery. This includes evacuation support and culturally sensitive services, offered with wraparounds on site, taking into consideration mental health, traditional food, language interpretation and child care. I want to share that we have been delivering these in a collaborative way to ensure that we are reflecting and respecting the needs of first nations. To ensure timely support, we have also provided advance payments to on-reserve and eligible first nation communities. This funding helps communities respond to the immediate need without waiting for reimbursement in a time of crisis. These upfront supports are a reflection of our commitment to uphold the dignity and well-being of every community member during a time of crisis. I spoke earlier today to Chief Bobby Cameron, and I want to echo his statement: Federal and provincial governments need to work together to respond to first nation emergencies jointly and collaboratively. We have shown that we are open to that dialogue and that partnership. We are also working to ensure that we are looking at long-term wildfire preparedness. Our FireSmart program supports preparedness through firefighter training, fuel management and vegetation clearing projects. The non-structural mitigation and preparedness program also helps to develop and test emergency management plans and to build capacity to respond to future emergencies. Preparedness is key. These supports are about building strength before disaster strikes so that communities can mitigate the impact to the greatest extent possible. It is to ensure not only that they have the ability to respond but also that they have the capacity to recover and thrive. We have started to support indigenous nations in other provinces, such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, calling them and ensuring that our dialogue is in place to respond to their emerging needs. Indigenous Services Canada has taken steps to strengthen its approach. This includes implementing a new risk-based funding model, improving emergency management plans and enhancing program indicators. A key part of this work is multilateral emergency management service agreements, which are agreements that recognize first nations as full and equal partners alongside federal, provincial and territorial governments. These agreements are not just administrative tools; they ensure that we are showcasing shared responsibility and culturally appropriate emergency services. The future of first nations emergency management is top of mind for me as I take on this new role. It is an issue that has come up in many conversations that I have had with first nations leaders over the past few days. I would like to share another quote. Grand Chief Wilson of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs said, “I want to acknowledge the minister for listening to our concerns and establishing direct lines of communication. We are making progress, and we understand there are gaps that need to be addressed. I look forward to working with the minister to address these gaps.” We are also looking ahead to the 2025 wildfire season to ensure that we are not waiting; we are preparing. This ministry dedicates annual funding to capacity, mitigation and preparedness in first nations communities. This includes support for emergency management coordinator positions, and many have showcased their skill and capacity over the past few days. We are laying the groundwork for a future where communities are not just reacting to emergencies but equipped to prevent them. The post-wildfire season will be met with a debrief with first nations communities to focus on preparedness and the response and reaction. There is always room to improve. We want to ensure that it comes directly from first nations. This is a new government, with new opportunities, and we will respond in a new way, focused on first nations, indigenous peoples, Inuit and Métis. I want to ensure that health and safety of all first nations community members is the priority of this ministry. We are doing work to support in all capacities. Emergencies occur, and we want to support communities and ensure that they can restore their positions, bring their members home in a culturally safe way, avoid vulnerability and exploitation, and strengthen the resilience they have as first nations people. In closing, wildfires are devastating. They test the strength of first nations communities and the bonds that hold us together. I want to acknowledge all entities that have supported this process, including the Canadian Armed Forces, all volunteers and all other organizing resources that have supported first nations in their evacuation and in the time that they are spending away from their homes. I also want to acknowledge those that will work with us to return the evacuees safely to their communities. Meegwetch . Nakurmiik ."
"One glaring matter to arise from the inquiry was this mention of the corporate greed of some of the developers. It is right, as my hon. Friend says, that the Government will be looking to ban those contracts. Survivors have also asked for prosecutions to come forward. Does he agree that, in addition to the Government banning those companies from receiving other contracts, there should be additional funding for the Met police so that they can swiftly bring to justice those who were responsible for this?"
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to share a number of thoughts, particularly with the members opposite. This is important for people who follow the debate of the estimates. It is a very important debate that is actually taking place. We often make reference to our having a new Prime Minister , a new administration and a government that truly understand the economy. There are 8.5 million Canadians from coast to coast to coast who have supported the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party, which is a record number of votes in the history of Canada. Ultimately, I think it is important that we respond to the mandate that we have been given in a very aggressive yet positive fashion. We need to work hard for Canadians and co-operate where we can with opposition parties, in anticipation that opposition parties will also co-operate with the government at times, as they have demonstrated to a certain degree already. I will get into more of those details, but suffice it to say that there has been a change in government, the Prime Minister and the administration. An example would be the consumer price on carbon. The Conservatives called it the carbon tax. It is now gone. We have a new Prime Minister, and that policy is now gone. We now have a Prime Minister who has brought in legislation through the cabinet and caucus to deal with issues such as border control through Bill C-2 . We could talk about the tax break, Bill C-4 . We could talk about the one Canadian economy, Bill C-5 . We could talk about what the Prime Minister has done since April 28, over and above that substantial legislation and over and above the estimates that have been provided in the ways and means. We can talk about, for example, the first ministers' meetings that have taken place. We could talk about the G7 conference that is taking place today, not to mention the many other initiatives where we have seen the new Prime Minister tackle the issue of building Canada strong, elbows up. Damn right. I believe that we have a Prime Minister who does have his elbows up going at it, dealing with the different issues that are before Canadians today, with an objective of building the strongest, healthiest economy in the G7. That is the goal, and I believe we will be able to achieve that goal. Now, we are very much, given the minority situation, going to be looking for a co-operating partner. Today it might be the Conservatives, while tomorrow it might be the Bloc. That is possible. It could even be some of the independents, but at the end of the day, we are going to continue to move on important initiatives to build the economy. Before I go into the details on that, I want to talk about something that has been referenced by the Prime Minister : our social programs. I have always been a very strong advocate on the issue of health care. I do not say that lightly because, since I was first elected in 1988 to the Manitoba legislature, I have had the opportunity to play many different roles. Since I came to Ottawa in 2010 as a member of Parliament, one of the consistent issues has been health care. It seems to have always been one of the top three issues over the past 35-plus years. I truly believe it is a part of our Canadian identity. It is one of the reasons why many people feel passionate about saying, “I am a Canadian.” One of the shared values we have is our health care system. I am a nationalist in the sense that I believe that individuals, no matter where they live in Canada, should have access to a very basic level of health care services throughout the nation. That is why it is important that we support and get behind the Canada Health Act. That is why health care transfers are so critically important. The federal government does have a role, a significant role, to play in health care in Canada. I was glad when the Justin Trudeau administration, of which I was a part, put such a strong emphasis on health care and providing health care services through issues such as long-term care and mental health; the creation of the true national pharmacare program, or at least the beginning of one; and the advancement of the dental care program, something I think we should be looking at ways we could ultimately be improving still. Having said that, I want to go to what the Prime Minister has been so focused on. We can review the last election and look at election night. I hear a lot from my friends in the Bloc, who said that all that people wanted to talk about was the Trump factor, the trade and the tariffs, and that this was the reason the Bloc lost all the seats in the province of Quebec. I think the result was 44 Liberals, 22 Bloc members and 11 Conservatives. We had a substantial increase, but the province of Quebec was not alone; there were 8.5 million votes, and every province in the country has Liberal members of Parliament. I can tell members that it did not matter where we went in the country, people were genuinely concerned, and that concern was addressed in a very tangible way by the Liberal Party of Canada, in particular by the Prime Minister of Canada. I reflect on the election, and one of the very first announcements, which, if it was not on day one of the election, it was shortly thereafter. The Prime Minister indicated that he was going to give a tax break to Canadians. By the way, that promise was kept, and I will get to that point, but shortly after and throughout, he also amplified the issue of Trump trade tariffs and the impact that they were going to have on Canada. I believe that Canadians saw a contrast between the Prime Minister , the current leader of the Liberal Party, during the campaign, and Pierre Poilievre, and what they saw in the Prime Minister was an individual who had a background in dealing with the economy. He was appointed by a Conservative prime minister to be the Governor of the Bank of Canada. He was appointed to the Bank of England, again as the governor. The leader of the Liberal Party, the Prime Minister of Canada, has a history of working with and developing an economy, and when Canadians looked at that and compared it to what the Conservative Party was offering, I not only believe that they made the right decision, but I also believe that it was in the best interest of Canadians. Shortly after the election, we saw the Prime Minister take on the issues and put things into place in the form of legislation and budget measures. I will cite one of the best budget measures coming from the Prime Minister, which was announced just last week: the 2% of GDP for the Canadian forces. How long have we waited for a prime minister to not only actually make the commitment but also to realize it in the form of a budget, which we will be seeing later this year? “Patience is a virtue”, they say. The budget will be before us, and we are going to see the 2% of the GDP. If members flash back to the time Pierre Poilievre sat in the cabinet of Stephen Harper, it was borderline 1%, or maybe even a little less than 1%, of the GDP. In the following administration, Justin Trudeau did increase it substantially. For the first time in generations, we can now say that Canada is going to be living up to the United Nations target of 2%, which is a significant budget achievement. We can also take a look in terms of the other actions that this new Prime Minister and government have put into place. We talked about border controls, and we now have Bill C-2 before us, which will be complemented by an additional 1,000 CBSA officers along with another 1,000 RCMP law enforcement officers. The legislation would even improve the strength of our border, which is something we talked about during the campaign. The campaign ended April 28, and we now have legislation before us to be able to deal with the election platform. Again, we would think that members opposite would see the true value. They are a little slow on Bill C-2, but I will not push them too hard on that. At the end of the day, I know in my heart that this is substantial legislation that will ultimately make a positive difference, especially if we contrast it to the days in which Pierre Poilievre sat around the cabinet table with Stephen Harper, and they actually cut border control officers, cut money from our borders and the safety of our borders. It is an amazing contrast. We can advance to yet another piece of legislation, Bill C-4 , which would primarily do three things. First, it would provide the 2% tax break that the Prime Minister committed to during the election. Second, it would provide, for first-time homebuyers, the elimination of GST on a home of up to $1 million, which does a couple of things in itself. It would make it more affordable for young people to actually purchase a home, and, ultimately, it would assist in increasing Canada's housing stock at the same time. Again, I could draw the comparison of when Pierre Poilievre sat around that cabinet table. In fact, he was actually the minister of housing. How did he do on the housing file? Well, everyone knows he was challenged to build six houses, and as I have said in the past, we still do not know where those six houses were, but we are told that there were actually six houses. Contrast is really quite surprising. However, third, the bill would ultimately take out of law the consumer price on pollution, which is a substantial piece of legislation, again from April 28. This is legislation that should pass. Let us fast-forward to another piece of legislation that we have had a great deal of discussion on: Bill C-5 , the one Canadian economy act. It should be no surprise to anyone in this House that the government has made that legislation a priority. From my perspective, it was the number one priority for the Prime Minister of Canada during the campaign. It provides assurances to Canadians that, as a government and a Prime Minister, we are going to push, and push hard, to build a stronger, healthier one Canadian economy by taking down those federal barriers before July 1. It was a solid commitment that was provided by the Prime Minister. I appreciate the fact that my friends in the Conservative Party actually recognize that, because without the support of at least one other party or some independents, we would not be able to pass Bill C-5, and that has been made abundantly clear by my friends in the Bloc. It does not take much to prevent legislation from passing. Time allocation and closure motions are tools used at times in order to be able to get something through the House, because often there is no commitment to seeing it pass. If we listened to the Bloc members, that bill would never pass, so we had to bring in closure. The Bloc then says doing that is anti-democratic and is not parliamentary. We are a minority government and cannot do it alone. Fortunately, the Conservatives were also listening to Canadians in all regions and recognized that it was an important piece of legislation. If they would like to see amendments to it, that is fine, but at the end of the day, Bill C-5 is a reflection of what Canadians expect of this Parliament. I am disappointed in my friends in the Bloc. Take a look at what the Prime Minister has done. I made reference to the fact that there was a first ministers meeting two weeks ago, where the Prime Minister sat with premiers of the different provinces and territories and had a thorough discussion about identifying national projects that would advance Canadian interests. Even the Province of Quebec participated in that. Each province has projects. I can recall the Prime Minister asking what those national projects were and soliciting opinions and thoughts on them. As opposed to potentially filibustering the bill, the Bloc could have actually contributed by talking about the many things that could assist the Province of Quebec through a national perspective. For example, hydro is something that could ultimately help not only my own province of Manitoba in terms of grids but also the Province of Quebec. I would suggest there are other potential projects there that need to be talked about and brought to the attention of the administration, to the premiers and the Prime Minister so that we can develop those projects. I think of things such as the Port of Churchill and the potential of rail, and, absolutely, pipelines matter. There are issues we can take on as national projects and advance them. Bill C-5 is an important piece of legislation. In a very short period of time, we have seen a Prime Minister who understands what Canadians want and developed a platform that highlights the legislation we introduced and that highlighted many of the budgetary allocations that are already starting to go out. The budget will be coming out in the fall, but it will be a budget that reflects Canadian interests and the direction this Prime Minister, the cabinet and the Liberal caucus want us to move forward on, which is based on listening to what our constituents are telling us. It is a true reflection of what Canadians want. We are going to continue to build a country that is second to no other in the G7 in strength and economic power on a per capita basis. This is something that can be achieved. All we need is to continue to work together, where we can, to develop those ideas. When an idea is sound and good, I suspect it will receive a very positive outcome. It might take some time, but at least let us talk about those issues. We can, in fact, make a difference. To conclude, I look forward to the questions that might be asked."
"Mr. Chair, I request that the hon. member allow me to respond to questions. The main estimates include—"
"Mr. Chair, once again, I have said that it is not my job to select the projects that will be national unity projects, but it is my job to make sure that the environment—"
"Madam Chair, Desjardins is predicting that the number could be $600 billion. What will that do to the debt interest cost? Will it go up, or down?"
"Today, we mark five years since the start of the covid-19 pandemic. Just under 227,000 people in the UK died with covid-19 listed as a cause on their death certificate. Every one of those statistics is a mother, a father, a brother, a sister, a child, a neighbour or a friend. Thousands were separated from their loved ones, and that loss and grief may never fully heal. Yet in the darkest of times, the British people shone with immense compassion and courage, and a sense of community spirit. Doctors, nurses and carers worked punishing hours, often risking their own lives; teachers, council workers and others worked in the toughest of conditions; and volunteers came forward in droves to collect and deliver prescriptions, shop for the frail and elderly, staff temporary centres to administer vaccines, and check in on neighbours. That resilience and solidarity showed the very best of who we are. Sadly, that same spirit of public service was not reflected in the highest offices of Government. The findings of the first covid inquiry, led by Baroness Hallett, laid bare the truth that the UK was ill-prepared for dealing with a catastrophic emergency, let alone the coronavirus pandemic. We had planned for the wrong pandemic, one based on flu; we ignored the risks associated with other potential pathogens; we ignored warnings; and then we failed to act on lessons from past civil emergency exercises and outbreaks of disease. These were systemic and political failings that worsened people's suffering. Let us be frank: the most vulnerable paid the highest price. There was cruelty in the rigidity of restrictions, with families kept apart even in their loved ones' final moments. All of this was made more painful by the bitter hypocrisy of partygate, a betrayal of trust that mocked the sacrifices of millions. The Lib Dems called for an inquiry in 2020, and we continue to demand answers. The full facts must be known about every aspect of the Government's poor response. This is not born out of a desire for vengeance; the British people deserve to know the truth, and they deserve far better in future. We now have a moral responsibility to act, and this Government must commit  to implementing the inquiry's recommendations in full and without delay. Patients and care home residents must have a legal right to maintain contact with their loved ones; a comprehensive civil emergency strategy is essential; and the new UK Resilience Academy must train 4,000 people in resilience and emergency roles, as promised. Can the Minister give us confidence that this will be delivered? The voices of frail and older people must be heard at the heart of Government planning. We call for a commissioner for ageing and older people, to ensure that their needs are never neglected again. Public officials must be held to a duty of candour--the Government's promise of a Hillsborough law remains unfulfilled. Can the Minister say when survivors and families will see the legislation for which they have waited so long? We must also confront a hard truth: our nation was less resilient because health inequality has left our population quite simply less healthy. Years of cuts to public health services under the Conservatives left us more vulnerable. The Lib Dems are calling for urgent action to increase the public health grant and allow communities to co-produce plans; establish a health creation unit to lead cross-Government efforts to improve health and wellbeing and tackle inequality; improve access to blood pressure checks in community spaces and expand social prescribing; introduce a new kitemark for health apps and digital health tools, ensuring that they are clinically sound; create a new levy on tobacco company profits to fund healthcare and smoking cessation services; and pass a clean air Act to tackle pollution and improve air quality. Lastly, we must not forget those living with the consequences of the virus, as Members have mentioned. We call for a long covid register. As we remember those whom we lost, we owe it to them and to future generations to ensure that these lessons are not buried in reports and left on shelves, but lead to real changes that make improvements in our constituents' lives. The British people were courageous, generous and selfless; they deserve a Government who act to match that spirit."
I welcome my hon. Friend's point. The Minister for Safeguarding will follow up these issues with the devolved Administrations. My hon. Friend is right that this is a devolved issue but that this kind of appalling crime is happening everywhere. Action is needed everywhere to safeguard and protect children.

What steps she is taking with Cabinet colleagues to create new jobs in Wales
"The Minister knows that I have a lot of time for her, and I welcome her announcement today, but it will be of little relief to those who are living with spray-foam insulation that was inadequately installed, and there has been no support from the Government to fix that. Putting that aside, I wondered what Government support is available for off-grid households in rural areas, to ensure that they do not miss out and are included in these plans?"
"My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point about accountability. That is not lost on me as the Secretary of State, and it is something that I have impressed upon the BBC's leadership. When there is one editorial failure, it is something that must be gripped; where there are several, it becomes a problem of leadership. I very much take his point about that. He raised a point about the strength of feeling that people have about this issue, given that this was a music festival, and it was at a music festival on 7 October that so many young people lost their lives, with others kidnapped, never to return to their families, and some are still being held hostage. At that moment, it would have been the perfect place to express support, love and solidarity with those who are still suffering. I know there were those at the festival who were doing precisely that, but they were hindered by some of the appalling scenes that we have seen. That is why we are determined to grip this and ensure that music festivals are a safe and inclusive space for everybody. The Government are reaching out to other music festivals, and to Glastonbury, to see what more can be done to express solidarity with those who are still suffering as a consequence of the appalling events of 7 October, and to see what we can do to support those efforts."
"I am very sorry to hear of the experiences of the hon. Lady's constituent; it is clearly a horrifying case, and my sympathies are with her. Given that stalking protection orders are relatively new, there is a case for continually examining whether their roll-out is working as intended. They are primarily a Home Office responsibility, but there are amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill, which is going through the House, that are designed to strengthen these orders. If the hon. Lady will write to me, I will ensure that she has a meeting with the relevant Minister to talk through the specifics of the case that she has raised, and the lessons that can be learned as we strengthen these orders for everyone."
"Yeah--but I am butch like you! [Laughter.] As I was saying, most people do not really comment on the fact that I live with a man. They are more interested in the fact that he works for Marks & Spencer and gets 20% off. But it is important that we have these conversations because there are still people around the world, and in communities in this country, who cannot come out. There are people in communities in our country who live a different life from the one that they want to live, and there are people around the world, as the Minister rightly says, who will be put to death if they love the person they really want to love. That is why Pride Month is important, and its theme of activism and social change emphasises a reflection on the contributions of LGBT individuals and communities in creating a better world for us all. We are lucky in this country that we have a host of people in our history who have been at the forefront of fighting for equality. Yes, there are the famous people--Dame Kelly Holmes, Tom Daley and Sir Ian McKellen, to name but a few--but there are so many inspiring LGBT people from right across the decades, as the Minister mentioned. I would like to mention Sophia Jex-Blake, Scotland's first female doctor, who fought for so many women to be allowed to train as doctors and founded medical schools up in Scotland, where she eventually met her life partner, whom she lived with until her death in 1912. I also want to mention Patrick Trevor-Roper, who was one of only three witnesses who could be convinced to appear before the Wolfenden committee. His evidence helped to start the journey to decriminalisation. Those people, in my view, are incredibly brave. Given that we have commemorated the 80th anniversary of VE Day this year, I think we should also remember one of my personal heroes, Dr Alan Turing, a man whose brilliance cracked the Nazis' Enigma code. This was an incredible feat, given that Enigma had 159 million million million settings. He played a crucial role in cracking the intercepted messages that enabled the allies to defeat the enemy in the Atlantic and in other engagements. We owe him so much, but his treatment later, when he was prosecuted for being gay, is a shame that I know we all  find abhorrent. The Government rightly apologised and he was later posthumously pardoned. In my view, he is a true hero of our nation. Of course, we have had champions in this place, too--people like Chris Smith, who bravely became the first openly gay MP; Edwina Currie, who led a debate on changing the age of consent; and too many other hon. and right hon. Members to name. I do want to name one or two from the Conservative side because I know everyone will do their own pitches. There are people like our former colleague Eric Ollerenshaw, who was on that first Gay Pride march in 1972. He recalled to me that he was actually spat at by the police--that is how bad it was. There are people like Mike Freer, who campaigned hard on issues like PrEP, and our former colleague Elliot Colburn. I would like to take this opportunity to say happy birthday to LGBT+ Conservatives, which celebrates its 50th birthday this year, making it one of the oldest LGBT-affiliated groups for a political party in the world--a title it shares with LGBT+ Labour. I wish LGBT+ Labour a happy birthday as well. In 1975, the LGBT Conservatives were established by Professor Peter Walter Campbell. I am that old that I have seen LGBT Conservatives go through several guises over the 30 years since I first joined. Back then, it was known as TORCHE--Tory Campaign for Homosexual Equality. I pay tribute to the work it has done over those 50 years. Little did those founders and that first generation of our LGBT Conservatives and Labour know it, but they were merely years away from a global HIV/AIDS epidemic. Around the world, hundreds of thousands of people would lose their lives, including people here in the UK. Gay and bisexual men lived in fear, and many felt powerless and hopeless. If we fast forward to 2025, we find ourselves in a truly different world, and I want to thank all those who have made that change possible. I recognise that those contributions have come from parties across this Chamber, and I thank them all for it. I am proud of our record as a party over the last 14 years for the lives of LGBT people, not least the rolling out of highly active antiretroviral therapy treatment for HIV in England and funding the first ever HIV testing week. In 2013, we introduced same-sex couples' marriage in England and Wales, which was one of the most memorable debates in my time in the House and one of my proudest moments here. We introduced the legalisation of self-testing kits for HIV, as well as a host of other things that we are proud to have done. I also want to remark on the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for South West Wiltshire (Dr Murrison), who is no longer here, about people in the armed forces and to pay tribute to Lord Etherton. When I was the Equalities Minister, I had the privilege of meeting him several times as he went through that report. He did not just get evidence from thousands of people; he personally read every single testament because he wanted to know those stories inside out, and thank goodness he did that. I pay tribute to him for the work he has done. Thinking about all these achievements and those of former MPs and other inspirational figures, I find it appalling and deeply disappointing that some Prides across the country have banned our political parties from this year's parades. LGBT Conservatives, LGBT Labour, LGBT Lib Dems and all others are not allowed  to attend. Like the Minister, I also remind the organisers that it was these groups and so many MPs in this House that brought about the changes we enjoy today. As Jo Cox said, there is more that unites us than divides us. Them causing this divide is a retrograde step, and I pay tribute to the likes of Owen Meredith and others who have taken up this fight. I call on the organisers to think again, especially as two parties celebrate their 50th birthday in terms of LGBT issues. I am aware that many colleagues want to contribute, but I have a couple of questions for the answering Minister. I would like an update on the HIV programme. It touched me that people across the House want to embark on that ambition of having no new HIV infections in this country by 2030; of course, we have only one Parliament left to get that done. Could the Minister set out where the Government are up to on that and what plans they have to ensure that we meet that ambitious target? Will the Government ensure that they are working with our devolved regions to ensure a UK approach to eradicating new HIV cases--not just England, but Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, too? We can end new HIV cases without a vaccine or cure, and wouldn't it be great for the UK to be the first place to do so? We want the Government to succeed on this issue, building on a lot of the work that we did in office and working with great organisations like the Terrence Higgins Trust. Let us make that an ambition for all of us. Let us remember why we have Pride in the first place, and make this Pride count."
"Mr. Speaker, I wish they had talked to someone. I would say that we had a great trip out there. We met with the great unionized steelworkers and others who build this country from coast to coast. I do not think the Liberals talked to anyone, because when we look at the facts that I have pointed out repeatedly, we see that they do not have a plan. They need a plan for the fundamental aspects of making a zero-emission vehicle for Canadians to actually be able to drive and charge, and they have no plan for that. As I say, this is 100% Liberal ideology over reality."
"Mr. Speaker, last summer, the Conservatives called for a 100% surtax on electric vehicles manufactured in China, and a few months later, the Liberal government imposed that surtax. Of course, we share the Conservatives' concern about the cost of electric vehicles. I would like to know the government's position on this. According to an Abacus poll released yesterday, 53% of Canadians would prefer for the import surtax that is being imposed on Chinese vehicles at the request of U.S. to be lower to make electric vehicles more affordable. What is the Liberal government’s position on this?"
"Mr. Speaker, I can assure the minister that no one has enough time to watch him. The minister cannot answer if these types of actions would be caught. The Prime Minister set this up in 2022 and 2024, when he was a financial adviser to Justin Trudeau. Was there a government effort to turn a blind eye to this tax evasion, yes or no?"
"Mr. Speaker, earlier I shared the story of one of my constituents whose child was born prematurely while he was travelling. Now the child is three months old and needs medical care. Unfortunately, he cannot get his Canadian citizenship because his parents were born abroad. This means he cannot receive medical care because the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec, or RAMQ, refuses to issue him a health insurance card because he is not a Canadian citizen. This issue is causing real problems for some children."
"The Government's defining mission is delivering economic growth and driving up living standards. That is why we are investing up to PS200 million across 10 Scottish towns over 10 years to support regeneration, tackle inequalities and unleash their full potential. That will empower local communities, improve public services and create new opportunities. That is, of course, alongside the shared prosperity fund, which is investing PS4.4 million in Fife this year."
"My hon. Friend is making a powerful point. Does she share my concern that most of our discussions today were thrashed out in Committee, and now we are being told that we have to leave them to the Lords, because we cannot fix the issues here? That is a really flawed process."
"I welcome what the Foreign Secretary has said, and I warmly welcome the Prime Minister's repeated assurances that vaccination remains an international development priority. Ahead of tomorrow's high-level pledging summit, does the Foreign Secretary agree that the UK must continue to make a significant contribution to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to ensure that millions of children are protected from some of the world's deadliest yet treatable diseases, such as malaria?"
"since its founding, the Valluvan Tamil Academy, or VTA, has played a vital role in teaching the Tamil language to children in Virginia. Tamil, one of the world's oldest languages, is spoken by over 80 million people globally, including 360,000 Americans. This past weekend marked a major milestone: the VTA's 15th Annual Day Celebration. I was honored to join students, families, and community leaders to celebrate and recognize the work that has been done to educate the next generation on Tamil history. I congratulate the Valluvan Tamil Academy, and I thank them for all that they do for our community in Virginia. I am looking forward to working together for many years to come."
"I rise today to honor an extraordinary woman, Ms. Louella Avent, as she celebrates her 85th birthday. Though her official birthday was May 13, 1940, we joyously mark this milestone with a celebration on Saturday, June 7, at the Rose Room. Born in Oxford, Mississippi, Ms. Avent was raised by dedicated farmers. For the past 65 years, Chicago has been her cherished second home. A lifelong learner, she graduated high school and continued her education at Loop College, now Harold Washington College. Her commitment to education continues even now as she embraces ``senior life.''  Ms. Avent`s professional life includes dedicated service to the City of Chicago and, most recently, as a greeter at Mark Realty. She's also certified by the Chicago Greater Food Depository and proudly identifies as a chef by trade. Throughout her career, she has had the honor of meeting numerous political figures, a testament to her widespread connections and impact. For Ms. Avent, the proudest moments in her workplace have always revolved around ``just being able to help people.'' Her guiding principle, ``If I can help somebody along the way, then my living will not be in vain,'' perfectly encapsulates her loving and serving spirit. Her dedication extends far beyond her professional roles. Ms. Avent is a profound woman of faith, having transitioned from Baptist to Pentecostal about 62 years ago. She emphasizes that serving the Lord is the core value guiding her life. She is a true community worker, participant, and activist, known for organizing a multitude of events. Her leadership and keen ability to identify needs and act upon them are truly remarkable. Ms. Avent has been a lifelong supporter of Operation PUSH, officially becoming a member in March 2025. Her commitment to civil rights and community empowerment is unwavering. Among her major milestones, she fondly recalls meeting the late Mayor Richard Daley, and the esteemed Rev. Jesse Jackson, Sr. and Mrs. Jacqueline Jackson. Her journey through 85 years has been marked by both illnesses and losses, yet through it all, ``the joy of the Lord has been her strength.'' She is incredibly proud of her dutiful son, Caesar, an MBA graduate, who she credits as a true blessing in her life. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating a remarkable individual whose life exemplifies resilience, service, and profound love for humanity."
"I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments. Each successive generation that arrives on these shores, as people have done for millennia, has added to our rich cultural and social fabric. He is absolutely right to highlight his part of the world and the impact that people have had in his community. On the things that we should also look at, I will say that we should end the disproportionate use of stop and search. We should also look very carefully at the use of live facial recognition, which is most likely to wrongly identify black men and women. In so many ways, we are holding this debate because of the tireless campaigning of many of the Windrush generation, not least the Liberal Democrat peer, my noble Friend Baroness Floella Benjamin. Floella's journey is emblematic of the Windrush generation. She arrived in Britain from Trinidad in 1960 at the age of 10, accompanied by three of her siblings. Her childhood was marked by persistent racism; she recalls every day as a battle where she was either ignored or subjected to verbal abuse. During a house viewing, neighbours called the police, accusing her family of stealing furniture from what would soon be their own home. Floella, of course, was not alone. Many children of her generation endured those indignities in silence, shouldering the burden of rejection by clinging to the hope that life would one day improve. Leaving school at 16, she chartered an extraordinary path--first as an actress, then as a presenter, writer, independent producer and always a tireless advocate for the care, education and welfare of children worldwide. Today, she chairs the Windrush Commemoration Committee, which is charged with establishing a lasting tribute to the Windrush generation and its descendants. Among the Committee's notable achievements is the unveiling of the national Windrush monument at Waterloo station, which was designed by celebrated Jamaican artist Basil Watson, as mentioned earlier by the hon. Member for Vauxhall and Camberwell Green (Florence Eshalomi). The monument stands as a powerful symbol of the immense hardship  and equally immense contributions of the Windrush generation to British life. Floella's voice remains a powerful one, holding the Government to account to ensure that the Windrush generation receives the recognition and justice that it so rightly deserves. I believe it was Floella who first proposed the idea of Windrush Day as a national celebration of the moment when Caribbean communities came to rebuild Britain in the face of adversity. It is thanks to her determination that we are able to mark this occasion and speak of it today. As well as being the giver of the best hugs in Parliament, she is a celebrated author, using her experience to educate future generations with her writing. It is right that we celebrate Floella and all the Windrush generation today."
"Mr. Chair, the minister has mentioned in the media nuclear projects. The only time in the history of this country that a debate was scheduled to discuss nuclear energy, its pluses and minuses, was under the former minister of energy, Ray Hnatyshyn, in the government of Joe Clark. Would the minister care to commit to having an open debate on nuclear energy in the House of Commons?"
I must interrupt the member to give the hon. member the opportunity to answer the question.
"I am grateful to the shadow Secretary of State for making it clear to the House that she does not understand the principles of private sector investment, and neither is it particularly clever to stand at the Opposition Dispatch Box and make up figures to  attack. This Government stand ready for all eventualities, but I will make no apology for tackling the poor behaviour of water companies and water company executives that took place under the previous Government and that we are correcting. We even heard stories, which have been confirmed to me by water companies, of previous Conservative Secretaries of State shouting and screaming at water company bosses but not actually changing the law to do anything about the bonuses that they were able to pay themselves. This Government are taking action, working with customers, water companies and investors to ensure that we have a successful water  sector that works for the environment, customers and investors in a way that it completely failed to do under the previous Conservative Government."
"Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to share some really good news. Two athletes from my riding, Bennedict Mathurin and Luguentz Dort, have made it to the NBA finals. We are bursting with pride in these young Quebeckers from Montreal North. They are of Haitian descent, were born and trained here, on our streets, in our schools and in our parks. This is a great response to people who, like the president of our neighbour to the south, have denigrated communities with Haitian roots. This time, greatness is a 100% Canada-Quebec production made in Bourassa. In addition to these two athletes, I would also like to mention Chris Boucher, past winner of the NBA finals. This news illustrates the strength of our community's talent, perseverance and pride. These three young people shine and, today, their light is illuminating the world's largest basketball stage. Their journey is an inspiration that drives us to keep investing in our young people, celebrating our local talent and showcasing the riding of Bourassa at home and abroad. Now more than ever, a sports centre is an important and essential asset sorely lacking in Bourassa. The borough is organizing a public screening of the finals at Pilon Park in Bourassa so that we can all share this historic moment. Everyone is welcome to join in this collective outpouring of pride. Fortunately, these young men did not turn to crime as some unfortunately do. We are talking about crime today, and I want to acknowledge that the Prime Minister and the Minister of Public Safety have done careful, concrete work on this. The bill before us is ambitious, pragmatic and, above all, necessary in the current context. It is based on clear and focused SMART principles. It is a clear and effective response to very real threats: drug trafficking, organized crime, money laundering and weaknesses in our intelligence system. This is about more than legislative principles; it is about human lives. In Montreal and other big cities, people want to live in safe, peaceful neighbourhoods free from violence and crime. This bill is not just a legislative exercise; it is a commitment to people's peace of mind. I will give a few examples. The situation is alarming in our major cities such as Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, and Calgary. In the greater Montreal area, we are seeing a resurgence of violence and clandestine synthetic drug labs. The chemicals arrive through indirect channels, often by mail or international packages. This bill will allow for better monitoring of these products and rapid intervention by the Minister of Health. In Toronto, criminal networks are exploiting gaps in data access to operate large-scale fraud and money laundering schemes. Amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act, as well as cross-border information-sharing mechanisms, will give our police officers the tools they need to take action. In Vancouver, customs officers are facing an influx of suspicious goods arriving by sea. Amendments to the Customs Act and the Oceans Act will allow for upstream interventions, which I will discuss later. There is a lot of talk about being proactive. In Laval, Ottawa and Halifax, police are struggling to intercept packages containing prohibited substances because of restrictive postal laws. By amending the Canada Post Corporation Act, this bill will finally give them the means to do something about it. We also want to modernize legislation and strengthen operations. I would like to highlight some aspects of this bill. Bill C-2 aims to clarify exemptions from drug and cannabis laws to better regulate investigative tools. It seeks to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, giving the Minister of Health targeted powers over precursor chemicals. Once again, this is about being proactive. It is essential to take action upstream to stop these precursor chemicals, as they enable clandestine labs to operate. These precursor chemicals are used in the manufacture of fentanyl, for example. The bill seeks to enact the supporting authorized access to information act to ensure that electronic service providers can legally co‑operate with investigations. Access to cross-border data has to be improved, with respect for fundamental freedoms, and the Canada Post Corporation Act has to be amended to allow suspicious mail to be opened within a strict legal framework. Of course, there are a number of concrete measures against money laundering, including restrictions on cash payments and third-party deposits. As former vice-chair of Montreal's Commission de la sécurité publique, I saw first-hand the challenges that our police services are facing: legal limitations, administrative delays and a lack of coordination between the agencies. The bill addresses many of those gaps. It is not just a technical adjustment but a real strategic shift toward more proactive—as I have pointed out—more coordinated and better equipped public safety. That is why we need to ensure that new powers are balanced with mechanisms for transparency, accountability, and parliamentary oversight. In conclusion, the bill is a direct response to the everyday problems experienced by our constituents and especially by our police services. Passing the bill will send a clear message that Canada is protecting its borders, its children and its families. In other words, our sovereignty is being exercised in our neighbourhoods, on our streets, in our ports, in our digital networks and in our democratic institutions. I therefore support this bill with determination, but also with vigilance, to protect our communities, strengthen our security and uphold the values of justice and freedom that make our country, Canada, strong. This is a comprehensive bill that does not include any proposals from the opposition parties, which always come from a silo perspective. It really prioritizes prevention and proactive measures to ensure that Canada is truly safe and secure."
"Mr. Chair, unfortunately, it sounds like the answer is no. Please read the mass casualty report."
"Mr. Chair, how many non-nationalized projects has the Liberal government completed to date?"
"Order. That is very important, but why does the hon. Member not want others to get in?"
"Mr. Speaker, it is great to rise again to rebut the remarks of the member opposite. Our government has worked tirelessly for 10 years to help Canadians afford a home, but also to increase supply. We have done all kinds of work. We have decreased mortgage insurance. We have waived GST on new rental construction. We have helped with the national housing strategy and the rapid housing initiative to build new supply. I have six examples of projects in my riding that have gotten done as a result of those investments, which are key, and hundreds of new affordable housing units in our riding. Now we are adding more. There is also a tax-free savings account for Canadians so that young families can save up, tax-free, to purchase their first home. There is a whole package of measures. Obviously, I am running out of time. However, we will continue to build the homes that Canadians need and help young families get into those homes."
"Madam Speaker, I urge the member opposite to check the facts. The year-to-year housing starts are up across Canada. We are building more than ever before. We need to scale that to the next level, though. That is why this government ran on a commitment to build up to 500,000 homes a year across Canada. In 10 years, we have to scale up to that level, and that means cranking up a whole new industry on modular and off-site construction. We have to build faster, cheaper and greener across Canada to deliver the homes that Canadians need. That is what we are committed to."
"The hon. Gentleman asks where Scottish Labour MPs have been, so I will tell him: campaigning in Hamilton, making sure there is a Labour MSP and that in a year's time there will be a Labour Government in Edinburgh once again."
"I thank the shadow Secretary of State for his question and, even more importantly, I thank the amazing campaigners for what they are doing. This is probably the easiest question he is ever going to ask me. The answer is, of course, an emphatic yes."
"Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that very thoughtful question from the member for Waterloo. I do not think she is going to like the answer, and I am not going to take credit for this answer. I am actually going to give credit to a journalist from the National Post who reported today on an interesting story about all the items that I spoke to, but the heading, to answer my friend's question, is this: “Job one for Canada in this scary new world is to stop being stupid”. The answer is to stop being stupid and follow the damn rules. It is simple. It is common sense."
"Order. I reiterate the admonition that Mr Speaker has offered. This is one of the most far-reaching considerations that the House--even those of us who have been here for a very long time--can remember. It is understandable that a lot of Members will wish to take part, from across the House and on both sides of the argument, but looking around, it is quite clear that we cannot accommodate everybody. This means there will inevitably be a considerable number of interventions. All I would say, gently, is that interventions will be taken into account when considering the order of priority in which Members are called."
"The Foreign Secretary will be aware that Colombia and South Africa, as co-chairs of the Hague Group, have called an emergency ministerial conference in defence of international law and the rights of the Palestinian people, to take place in Bogota in July. Countries across the world are confirming their attendance. Will the UK Government send a representative, and join nations around the world in standing up for international law?"
"the American people have called ontheir elected officials to do what they asked, and that is to cut waste, fraud, and abuse. Today, we deliver. Together with President Trump, we are eliminating billions of dollars of spending, this wasteful spending on leftwing organizations that mock millions of Americans. We will also eliminate wasteful spending on radical programs in lands far, far away that do not put America first.  I have consistently voted to cut the spigot of spending, and I will continue that record by voting to pass this bill today. I urge my colleagues to do the same. Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Moore)."
"Mr. Chair, will she recommend funding the third link between Quebec City and Lévis, yes or no?"
"The recorded division on part 1 and the short title stands deferred. The next question is on part 2, including the schedule, which belongs to part 2. If a member participating in person wishes that part 2, including the schedule, be carried or carried on division, or if a member of a recognized party participating in person wishes to request a recorded division, I would invite them to rise and indicate it to the Chair."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her speech, but I have heard this speech several times today. It seems to be an excuse mechanism on why we do not need to deal with this as forcefully as we should. This was $65 million of taxpayers' money that disappeared to a group, which was previously at the bar of the House of Commons. I remember, at that point in time, the Liberal Party across the way was trying to make excuses for why those people did not have to appear here, because they were under stress and might cry if they had to come before the House of Commons. This was a cover-up of the highest order to make sure there was no accountability, and this accountability has not been borne all the way through. These people have to be held to account. We have to get that $65 million back. We have responsible government in this country. Does the member understand that responsible government means that somebody has to take accountability for the $65 million that was taken from taxpayers?"
"Mr. Speaker, as I noted in previous answers, in March 2024, PSPC revoked the security clearance of GC Strategies. We have also terminated all contracts, because we will always hold bad actors to account. Last week, the office of supplier integrity rendered the decision that makes GC Strategies ineligible for the next seven years. This is a process that is independent, that is free of political intervention, to hold bad actors to account, and it is working exactly as it should."
"I think the hon. Gentleman will find that, since this Government came to power, we have reduced the size of NHS waiting lists by a quarter of a million. NHS waiting lists are coming down--latest figures show that this is the first time in 17 years that waiting lists have fallen in the month of April--so we are making progress, not least thanks to the investment that we are putting into community diagnostic centres. The hon. Gentleman has some brass neck to complain about NHS services under this Government, when we are cleaning up the mess that the previous Government left behind."
"Since our last oral questions session, the Government have secured a historic agreement with the European  Union that removes a huge amount of cost and bureaucracy from our food and drinks industry, that backs British jobs and that will help British consumers. I thank the Paymaster General for all his excellent work on securing that agreement. We have also set out details of how we will reform the state, moving thousands of civil service jobs around the country and launching a new apprenticeship scheme so that young people, wherever they live, have a better chance of good work in the public service."
"Mr. Speaker, Conservatives agree to apply the vote, with the Conservatives voting against."
"Mr. Chair, I believe I have been answering the questions."
"We have been clear from the outset that we want to govern in a joined-up way, though as we all know the DNA in the departmental system is strong and has lasted a long time. Delivering our plan for change will require Departments to work together, whether that is to build more houses, give children the best start in life--today we announced access to free school meals for children of people on universal credit--or to protect the country against crime and security threats. It is very important that these are not goals of Departments but of the Government, and that is why we work together to achieve them."
The hon. member for Portage—Lisgar.
"Mr. Speaker, my first question to the hon. member is whether I can post his speech on my Facebook page. I would appreciate that. In all seriousness, the bill lacks a lot of things and is susceptible to many things, that is, court challenges as a result of the lack of indigenous consultation within the bill, and other parts as well. I wonder whether the hon. member can speak to the risks as they relate potential court challenges related to the bill."
"May I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising this issue? The Government remain deeply concerned about the use of blasphemy laws to undermine human rights in Pakistan, and those conversations between our Government and other Governments happen continuously. The Foreign Secretary is in his place, so I am sure that he has heard the hon. Gentleman's call."
The hon. member has the floor.
"Mr. Speaker, one in four Canadians avoids visiting a dentist because of cost and accessibility. Delaying preventive care can have a wide-reaching impact, including more expensive treatments, worsening health outcomes and lost productivity. Can the Minister of Jobs and Families please update Canadians on our plan to deliver dental care to uninsured Canadians?"
"It is really important for claimants of PIP that its funding should be sustainable into the future. The trajectory of the past few years has been unsustainable. We are taking action to put that right. The hon. Member is wrong to say that because people did not get four points last time, they will not keep their PIP. As I said, the view of the OBR, which I think is correct, is that most of them will. We are consulting on how to support those who will lose their PIP as a result of the changes that we have announced."
"Mr. Speaker, the House is demanding that this Liberal government table a budget, but instead the Liberals are asking Parliament to approve half a trillion dollars in new inflationary spending without tabling a budget. They are breaking their promise to limit spending by increasing expenditures by 8%. Meanwhile, the number of missed mortgage payments has reached record highs, and food banks are overwhelmed. Will the Liberals comply with the order of the House and table a budget now, this spring?"
"Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands. It is my enormous pleasure to rise in this House to respond to the Speech from the Throne. However, before I begin, I want to thank the residents of my constituency of Davenport for their faith and trust in me. I am enormously grateful that they have re-elected me for a fourth term to serve them as well as serve our great country. I give a special thanks to my incredible team and my created family. There is no way I could do this job without their love and support. Davenport residents came out in full force to vote in this election, because they are worried. They are worried about the threats by the President of the United States to our sovereignty, to our economy and to our future prosperity. They also know that the world is a more dangerous and a more uncertain place than at any other point since World War II. They feel that Canada is facing challenges that are unprecedented in our lifetimes, and so they voted for a leader and a party with a plan to make Canada more economically resilient. We have a plan to unite our country, and to defend and secure our country. We have a plan to turn the challenges that we face today into incredible opportunities so that Canadians can face the future with confidence, strength and the resources we need to succeed and prosper in the 21st century. Canada is the greatest country in the world. We are a strong and brave country, and our potential is unlimited. We are also a country that is in crisis, and we must act urgently and immediately to ensure that Canada remains strong and free. Key segments of our plan are outlined in the Speech from the Throne, and I will highlight some that I believe are particularly meaningful to the residents of my constituency of Davenport. At a time of global uncertainty and economic threats, Davenport residents are very happy that part of our plan is to ensure a more resilient Canada, one that is anchored in our own internal economic strength. We have virtually everything in this country. We now need to eliminate the roadblocks and ensure the resources to build us up. How do we do this? Our Prime Minister is clear: We will have one Canadian economy, not 13, which is what we have now. We will eliminate interprovincial trade barriers. Our federal government has promised to pass legislation to remove all remaining federal barriers to internal trade and labour mobility by July 1. The impact will be the freer movement of people, goods and services across our country. This will also allow our small and medium-sized businesses as well as our innovators to expand and grow across our country, which is something Davenport businesses will be very happy and very excited about. Best of all, lifting these barriers has the potential to add $200 billion to our economy each and every single year. Second, we will unite the country by investing in nation-building projects, primarily infrastructure, transportation and supply chain corridors. This would mean more supply chain options in Canada, which would mean more railroads, ports, highways, etc. The focus will be on projects of national significance and projects that will connect Canada, which will deepen Canada's ties with the world and will create high-paying jobs for generations of Canadians. Of course, all of these projects of national significance will have to ensure meaningful consultation with indigenous peoples, and all projects must adhere to our climate commitments. Best of all, Davenport residents are so excited by the ambition of our government. We truly believe that if we implement these measures and more, we can become not only a resilient economy, but also the strongest economy in the G7. As our Speech from the Throne says, the economy is only truly strong when it serves everyone. Many Davenport residents, like so many Canadians, are having such a hard time making ends meet, and so we are responding by introducing a middle-class tax cut, which will save two-income families up to $840 a year. Our government has also committed to continue to fund programs that we introduced over the last almost 10 years. This includes national child care, national dental care, pharmacare, the Canada child benefit and the Canada disability benefit. All these programs and more are life-changing programs that the residents in my constituency of Davenport love. I know they will be delighted that we will continue to support them. Our Speech from the Throne also contains a clear commitment for our government to build more housing. We are located in downtown west Toronto, and Davenport residents are worried that they are not going to be able to continue to live in the city that they love, that their kids and their grandkids will not be able to live in the city where they were raised. Our government has committed to a number of measures that will greatly benefit Davenport residents. We are going to provide more support for Canadians who are trying to buy homes. We will cut the GST on homes under $1 million for first-time homebuyers, which will deliver savings of up to $50,000. We are going to lower the GST on homes between $1 million and $1.5 million. Davenport is a multi-ethnic working-class/middle-class riding, and most of our homes are in these price ranges, so both of these measures are very welcome and will be very helpful. In addition, we are spending a lot more to build houses. Our federal government has committed to double down, with an ambitious new housing plan that will double the rate of homebuilding in Canada. We have learned a lot over the last few years about what worked and what we can do better. Based on this data, we have announced the most ambitious housing plan since World War II. These measures will include the creation of “build Canada homes” to accelerate the development of new affordable housing. We will invest in innovation. We are going to invest in the growth of modular and prefabricated housing. We will increase the financing for affordable home developers. We will eliminate red tape and development costs by cutting municipal development charges in half for multi-unit housing. All of this will rapidly increase housing supply and bring housing costs down. Members will be happy to learn that our additional funding and ambitious housing plan will use Canadian technology, Canadian skilled workers and Canadian lumber. All these measures, in addition to the ones we have already had in place over the last seven to eight years, will go a long way in ensuring greater housing supply and affordable home prices for the residents of my riding of Davenport and, indeed, for all Canadians. Community safety is vitally important to Davenport residents. For us, there are way too many American handguns on the city streets of Toronto. While the numbers have gone down, we still have far too many car thefts in Canada's largest city. I know that Davenport residents will be happy to know that our government, just yesterday, introduced Bill C-2 , which would enhance security at the border. When passed, CBSA officers who work at our borders will have new powers to stop stolen products, like cars, from leaving our country. They will also ensure the deployment of more scanners, drones and helicopters, additional personnel and canine teams, which will help stop guns and drugs from coming into our country. Finally, our government has committed to toughen the Criminal Code, to make bail harder for repeat offenders charged with violent crime and/or major offences. We have made serious commitments to spend more money to protect Canada's sovereignty. We have to do more to secure borders, to secure the Arctic and to secure Canada from coast to coast to coast. We have made a commitment to fulfill our NATO commitment of 2% of our GDP and we will achieve this with haste. I also believe that we will commit to even greater NATO spending, but we have to wait for NATO meetings in June for the total number and commitments. In conclusion, Canada is in crisis. It is time for Canadians to continue to stay united. It is time to build a resilient Canadian economy, to invest in national building projects and to spend less but invest more. It is time for us to secure our borders and protect our sovereignty, to build more affordable housing and put more money in the pockets of Canadians. These measures and more, as well as working together, will continue to ensure a prosperous Canada, the strongest economy in the G7 and an economy that truly serves everyone. Canada is the greatest country in the world. We are a confident country with an ambitious plan. We are indeed a country that is strong and free."
"My hon. Friend asks me if I accept that this is us; I do not accept that this is us. We are in a very serious disagreement with the Israeli Government about the conduct of the conflict. That disagreement is ongoing, and is strongly felt. Their policy on Gaza and the west bank is not the British Government's policy. Not only have I condemned it, but the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have done so repeatedly. I hear the frustration of the House about further measures, but let us accept that the British and Israeli Governments disagree profoundly on this question, that the disagreement between us is deeply felt, and that British policy is as it is, and is not what the Netanyahu Government are doing."
"Mr. Speaker, I think the minister is well aware that the Bloc Québécois supports the first part of the bill, which the minister also supports. I have a more technical question for her. Once the bill is passed, we believe that Quebec dairy producers and slaughterhouses could quickly be federally licensed. Basically, we would no longer have to rely on the federal government and they would quickly receive a licence. Can the minister tell me approximately how long it would take for slaughterhouses to become federally licensed once the bill has received royal assent? What is the timeline?"
"I welcome the investment for our teachers, school buildings, free school meals and SEND support, but I remain concerned about SEND provision in Somerset. I know from personal experience and from listening to constituents just how much of a difference giving SEND children the support they need can make. Teachers go above and beyond to give children in their classes the education they deserve, but we have a SEND system in crisis. It feels like we have gone backwards from when I was at school, which is, I am sorry to say, thanks to the cuts made under the previous Conservative Government over many years. As in so many other areas of life, parents in Yeovil are often left with a losing draw in a postcode lottery, waiting months to get the support their children deserve. There are two really effective ways that the Department can invest its budget to improve the outcome for SEND children at school. The backlog for education, health and care plans is too high in Somerset, and it is of course right that Somerset council receives more money to urgently support EHCP provision, but not every SEND child needs an EHCP for support. Instead, we urgently need universal screening for neurodiverse conditions at primary schools. That would be a fantastic way of empowering teachers to identify the individual needs of children in their classes and to adapt their teaching."
"9 years ago today, on June 12, 2016, at 2:02 a.m., our little happy town of Orlando, Florida, was changed forever as we saw 49 angels killed and 53 others who were injured in a mass shooting during Latin Night at the Pulse nightclub, a safe place for the LGBTQ community located just south of downtown Orlando. At the time, it was the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. I was proud to work on both sides of the aisle in June 2019 to introduce the National Pulse Memorial. In June 2020, it passed the House but did not pass the Senate. Finally, in June 2021, it was introduced, passed into law, and signed by President Biden. We know that the National Pulse Memorial happened because this was a national tragedy. At the time, we saw memorials and moments of silence across the Nation, across districts, from sea to shining sea. In remembrance of those who we lost and those who were injured and their families, I ask my colleagues to please stand and join me for a moment of silence."
"Mr. Speaker, last night in North Toronto, a man was shot to death and at least five others were wounded. Three masked men opened gun fire, steps away from the Yorkdale mall. It is not clear if, or how many, bystanders were hit. The Liberal record on crime is no accident. Liberal bills, such as Bill C-5 and Bill C-75 , put repeat criminals back on the streets, unleashing crime and chaos on the streets of Toronto. Gun crimes more than doubled under the Liberals. The solution is simple: Repeal soft-on-crime Liberal laws. When will the Liberals get serious about deadly shootings in Toronto and across Canada?"
"D.C. residents are treated as second-class citizens by Congress. They are required to pay Federal taxes, serve on Federal juries, and register with Selective Service in the same manner as residents of the States. They have served in the military since the Revolutionary War, which was fought to end taxation without representation and to give consent to the governed. Yet, Congress has denied them voting representation in Congress and full local self- government over the past 200 years. Last Congress, 100 bills and amendments were introduced to repeal or block local D.C. laws and policies. This Congress, 28 such bills and amendments have already been introduced, including bills to abolish the locally elected D.C. Government. Three months ago, Congress passed a bill that cut over $1 billion from the local D.C. budget, which consists entirely of locally raised revenue. While Congress has the authority to legislate on local D.C. matters, it does not have a duty to do so. In Federalist No. 43, James Madison said of D.C. residents: ``A municipal legislature for local purposes, derived from their own suffrages, will of course be allowed them.'' In 1953, the Supreme Court held that: ``There is no constitutional barrier to the delegation by Congress to the District of Columbia of full legislative power.'' The council has 13 members. If D.C. residents do not like how the members vote, residents can vote them out of office or pass a ballot measure. This is called democracy. Congress has 535 voting Members. None are elected by D.C. residents. If D.C. residents do not like how the Members vote on local D.C. matters, residents cannot vote them out of office or pass a ballot measure. That is the antithesis of democracy. Congress has the authority to grant D.C. residents voting representation in Congress and full local self-government. It simply needs to pass H.R. 51, the D.C. statehood bill, which would make the residential and commercial areas of D.C. a State. The Admissions Clause of the Constitution gives Congress the authority to admit new States. All 37 new States were admitted by an act of Congress. The District Clause of the Constitution gives Congress the authority to reduce the size of the Federal district, which it has previously done. The substance of H.R. 2056 is irrelevant since there is no justification for Congress to legislate on local D.C. matters, but I will briefly discuss it. Consistent with Federal law, the position of the Major Cities Chiefs Association and D.C.'s values, D.C. limits cooperation with Federal immigration agencies. D.C. concluded that cooperating with Federal immigration agencies would make D.C. less safe for all residents by diverting police resourcesand discouraging immigrants from interacting with the police department and other government agencies. Many States, cities, and counties have reached the same conclusion. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to respect the will of D.C. residents by voting ``no'' on this bill."
What assessment he has made of the potential impact of the UK-India free trade agreement on the economy.
"I rise today on behalf of the people of Minnesota to honor the lives of former Minnesota Speaker of the House Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were brutally murdered in their home on June 14. We also express our collective outrage over this politically motivated attack, which resulted in life-threatening injuries to my friend, Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette. My wife, Jacquie, and I have known Melissa for more than 20 years. Melissa and I joined the Minnesota Legislature together in 2005, and we served together until 2011. While we may have disagreed on policy, Melissa was a great colleague who fearlessly fought for what she believed in and devotedly served the people of Minnesota. One day, while I was in the Minnesota Legislature, I brought my only daughter to work with me. I wanted to introduce her to some of the strong female leaders in our State and my colleagues who were, frankly, exceptional at what they do. One of the first people who I introduced Katie to was Melissa Hortman. Though we came from different sides of the aisle, Melissa was incredibly gracious with her time and couldn't have been more kind and encouraging to my daughter. Melissa's warmth and generosity extended far beyond that moment. As speaker of the Minnesota House, she led with integrity and fostered bipartisan collaboration, even during the most challenging times in our State. While we mourn Melissa and her husband, Mark, we continue to pray for healing and peace for Senator Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, and their daughter, Hope, who were targeted by the same evil coward that night. I have known Senator Hoffman for many years and have had the pleasure of meeting his daughter, Hope, on several occasions as they visited our office here in Washington, D.C. John is a wonderful man, devoted husband and father, and friend. He is a commonsense legislator and has been a champion for Minnesotans with disabilities throughout his time in office. His bravery during the attack, lunging at the gunman to protect his family, likely saved their lives, though it left him with life- threatening injuries.  Yvette, who was also hit by the gunfire, heroically shielded their daughter, Hope, whose quick thinking in locking the door and calling 911 triggered a statewide law enforcement response that, frankly, prevented further tragedy. Their courage and heroism should continue to inspire us all. We are grateful to the brave men and women of law enforcement for their work to apprehend the evil perpetrator, and we look forward to justice being served. Let's be clear: There is absolutely no place in our country for politically motivated violence. This attack, carried out by an evil coward disguised as a peace officer, was not just an assault on two Minnesota families, but it was also an attack on the very fabric of our Nation. It sought to silence and strike fear into the hearts of those who dedicate their lives to public service. As we continue to grieve, we cannot and will not let this tragedy define us. We must show our communities, our State, our country, and the world that Minnesotans are united and that our resolve is stronger now more than ever. From Minneapolis to Mankato and from Delano to Duluth, we come together as one voice to condemn all forms of political violence. We commit to always treat each other with respect, regardless of differing opinions or political affiliations. Our prayers are with the Hortman family as they grieve the devastating loss of their loved ones, and we also continue to pray for John, Yvette, and Hope as they deal with the physical and emotional repercussions of this horrific attack. In closing, I will echo the words of Melissa and Mark's children: ``Hope and resilience are the enemy of fear. . . . Hold your loved ones a little closer. Love your neighbors. Treat each other with kindness and respect. The best way to honor our parents' memory is to do something, whether big or small, to make our community just a little better for someone else.'' May we always adhere to that sentiment."
"Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, just this past weekend, there was a femicide in my riding. Rates of domestic violence are alarming, and we need to tackle this issue head on. That is why we have gun control. Gun violence and domestic abuse often go hand in hand. We really need to protect our citizens. Our government is taking action. Our government believes in a safe society. We will continue to work to ensure that tragedies like these do not happen again."
I have the honour to lay upon the table the House of Commons' “Report to Canadians 2025”.
I call the Chair of the Justice Committee.
"Mr. Speaker, Canadians have been very clear. They want us to build a very strong country and a very strong economy. What we saw on Monday was exactly that. The Prime Minister sat down with premiers from across the country. We are united in the face of what we are seeing from the United States. We will work to build a strong economy together. We will not follow the Conservatives' advice."
"I thank the hon. member for sharing this new information with the Chair. As I mentioned earlier, the Chair will make a decision later. The hon. parliamentary secretary to the government House leader is rising on a point of order."
"Madam Chair, I do not need to confirm what is being done in the United Kingdom. It is public information."
"I thank my hon. Friend for all his support for cadet forces and the armed forces. It would be remiss of me not to say that cadet forces provide an excellent social mobility platform for young children across the country by giving them hope, priorities and principles, and pushing them to be determined. This Government have committed to raising the cadet force by 30%, and to giving more children across the country better opportunities."
"Mr. Speaker, one thing is for sure: The Liberals' national interest is not in the interest of the planet or future generations. In less than three weeks, they have gone from transport electrification to “Drill, baby, drill”. The Prime Minister has gone from Canada standing strong against Donald Trump to sidelining Quebec and forcing pipelines on it without debate, serious study or expert witnesses explaining the implications of Bill C‑5 . The Prime Minister obviously has no respect for the work of elected officials. He has clearly proven that with his gag order. When will he finally understand that this is a democracy?"
"As my hon. Friend rightly identifies, fire is a devolved matter. In England, stand-alone fire and rescue authorities will see an increase in core spending power of nearly PS70 million in 2025-26. Those fire and rescue authorities are required to plan for foreseeable risks in their area, including wildfire and flooding, and to decide where to direct resources. On co-operation, I assure him, as I did the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon), that I am talking to my counterparts in the devolved Government to make sure that we are tackling common problems and sharing that insight."
"Mr. Speaker, the Green Party also agrees to apply the vote and will be voting yes."
"The hon. Gentleman is a real champion on these issues. He will appreciate that education is a devolved matter. The spending review next week will set out details on the Barnett consequentials. The child poverty strategy is a UK-wide document, and I know that colleagues from Northern Ireland have been feeding into that review. As he knows, I meet regularly with my counterpart in Northern Ireland on issues of importance to the UK."
"Mr. Chair, the premise of the one Canadian economy act is that, together with the premiers, indigenous peoples and proponents, we would have a two-year window for the approval process. That two-year window would give the private sector the certainty it needs to put money to work to build projects of national interest."
"Madam Speaker, I was amazed yesterday when the answer with respect to the school food program rose from 400,000 children to 500,000 children, between two 30-second questions. The Prime Minister said he wanted to be judged by the experience of Canadians at the grocery store, so let us evaluate him. The cost of apples is up 18% since January. Oranges are up 26%, coffee is up 9% and beef is up a staggering 33%. Canadians are being crushed, and the Liberal response has been an additional half a trillion dollars in new inflationary spending. When will the Liberals table their budget that reduces inflation and cuts taxes so Canadians can afford to feed their family?"
"I rise today to recognize the distinguished career and dedicated service of Chief Master Sergeant Sharma J. Haynes on the occasion of her retirement from the United States Air Force. Chief Master Sergeant Haynes has served our Nation with unwavering commitment for over two decades, leaving an indelible mark on both the Air Force and Space Force. Chief Master Sergeant Haynes served as the Senior Enlisted Airman for Space Base Delta 2 at Buckley Space Force Base in my home state of Colorado. In this crucial role, she was the principal advisor to the installation commander, overseeing the morale, welfare, training, climate, readiness, and professional development of over 1,000 personnel. Her leadership was instrumental in ensuring the effective execution of critical missile warning and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions worldwide. Moreover, she played a vital role in supporting the numerous wings, mission partners, and personnel stationed at Buckley, as well as the extensive retiree community. A native of Greenville, South Carolina, Chief Master Sergeant Haynes entered the Air Force in 2003 and quickly established herself as a dedicated and capable leader. Her diverse background in financial management included positions as Flight Chief, Enlisted Force Development Manager, and Superintendent, with assignments and deployments spanning the globe, from Japan and South Korea to Afghanistan and the Pentagon. Chief Master Sergeant Haynes' commitment to professional development is evident in her extensive education, culminating in a Master of Business Administration degree and completion of numerous prestigious leadership courses. Her dedication to excellence is further highlighted by her numerous awards and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal and the Meritorious Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters. She has also been recognized with multiple Airman and Noncommissioned Officer of the Year awards throughout her career. Chief Master Sergeant Sharma J. Haynes embodies the highest ideals of military service. Her leadership, dedication, and unwavering commitment to the men and women under her charge have been exemplary. On behalf of the Sixth Congressional District of Colorado and a grateful Nation, I extend my deepest gratitude to Chief Master Sergeant Haynes for her exceptional service and wish her a long and fulfilling retirement. Her contributions to our Nation's security will be long remembered."
"Madam Speaker, as I said, Bill C‑2 is an ambitious bill containing several crime-fighting measures. We want to give our law enforcement agencies more flexible tools so they can take effective action to combat crime in our communities and make Canada safer and more secure. That means we will introduce more concrete measures. For example, the Liberal platform includes more resources for the RCMP. It is a commitment to make Canada stronger and safer."
"Madam Chair, the Parliamentary Budget Officer is projecting that in year 2029-2030, the debt servicing costs will be $70 billion. Last year, the debt servicing was more than what goes to health care transfers to the provinces. Can the minister confirm whether, at $70 billion, that will be more, or less, than what gets transferred to the provinces in health care transfers?"
What steps she is taking to support the aviation sector.
"I rise today to recognize and congratulate the Leechburg Rotary Club on an incredible milestone, 100 years of dedicated service to their community. Since receiving their charter in 1925, the Leechburg Rotary has been a pillar of civic engagement, compassion, and leadership in Armstrong County. From their very first project of placing Bibles in hotel rooms to helping pave Canal Street, building a new bridge over the Kiskiminetas River, and championing the creation of a high school band in the 1930s, the Leechburg Rotary has always stepped up to improve life for their neighbors. Whether it is supporting veterans or assisting children with disabilities or flipping pancakes for a good cause, generations after generations of Rotarians have kept the spirit of service alive. The Leechburg Rotary Club has helped build more than infrastructure. They built a sense of community, and for that we are grateful. Mr. Speaker, I again congratulate Leechburg Rotary on a century of service."
"It is fantastic to speak in the Chamber on a subject that has been part of my career for the better part of 20 years. I started  working in the construction sector as a civil engineer and finished my time working on major programmes around the world. Planning, and particularly planning in respect of national programmes and major infrastructure, has been a headache for me for a long time. The prolonged wasteful consultation that happens on major programmes, which stops the urgency and prevents an outcome-focused approach to delivering the major infrastructure that we need, is almost like death by a thousand cuts for a lot of communities. It is death by consultation and fatigue; it means that people do not engage in the process, and it drives a culture of nimbyism rather than a culture of wanting to deliver the homes and schools--the civil and social infrastructure--that we desperately need, and that everyone across this House calls out for in their constituencies. I am excited that the Bill has generated so much interest in the subject of planning and infrastructure. I was amazed to read through all the fantastic amendments that were tabled, many of which I suggest sit outside the core scope of the Bill, which is about speeding up delivery and delivering on the key missions of the Government, but it is fantastic none the less to see so much debate on the nuances, whether it is swift bricks, active travel or those other matters that are critical to creating lasting communities that people want to live in. I look forward to the continued activism from those across the House who have tabled amendments and spoken so passionately about planning--I am sure it was not just for clips for social media. I recognise what the hon. Member for Henley and Thame (Freddie van Mierlo) said about new clause 22. My big concern is that forcing change--compulsory purchase being one such example--does not change behaviour. That is something we have seen before. As the subject of Conservative leaflets that said I was going to run ULEZ in Northampton during the election, I know it is something that can become weaponised when we try to force it through, rather than bringing communities along with us. I do not think the approach that has been set out today is the right one, but I look forward to hearing further debate on that. I want to talk a bit about development corporations. Having worked around the world in a variety of different scenarios and seen how different countries set up delivery vehicles to deliver major programmes for housing and new cities--the infrastructure that we need--I am really pleased to see the introduction of additional powers to enable us to deliver more quickly and to put urgency back into delivery, whether we are developing new homes or towns. The increased powers in the Bill will be critical to ensuring that we have flexibility in the way we deliver those homes, so that they reflect the local community, and that we have sustainability at the heart of a development, so that local communities and bodies can work together to ensure that the places we deliver through the new towns programme in particular are green and sustainable in the long term. Those powers will also ensure that we can incorporate local need--I am particularly excited to see the transport provisions in the Bill. Often, even in Northampton, I see too many smaller communities disconnected by the lack of transport, because of a lack of thinking  about how people are going to get from place to place, which is so critical when we create new towns. Ultimately, that is about creating place, because we are not just creating new towns; we need to create places where people want to live, work and stay. We cannot do that without development corporations. I have seen the power for good that such corporations can be in places like east London. I spent a small amount of time living in Newham, where I saw the power that the London Legacy Development Corporation had post the Olympics to transform a deprived area of London, which was fantastic. I wonder now what more it could have done with the additional powers introduced in the Bill. For me, it is critical to create that local ownership and that drive to deliver, and it cannot just come from the top down. The change in the development corporation arrangements are one of the most undersold parts of the Bill, and will enable us to deliver the homes that are desperately needed by the hundreds of thousands of people living in temporary accommodation in hotels right across every single one of our constituencies. I do not think this is the end, but I would just reflect that there is plenty more to do on this subject--I have had this conversation privately with the Minister. There is a whole host of things we can do around digital planning, for instance. I was pleased and surprised to see that we are already trialling AI in the planning process in the UK, which could radically improve the way that we deliver projects across the UK. It could mean that communities are not living in uncertainty for weeks and even months as overstretched, under-resourced planning authorities try to work through the backlog that has been left after austerity and the many cuts the Conservatives made to local government. There is also work to do on building regulations. It was great to hear swift bricks debated yesterday, but there are better ways to deliver on that. On the delivery of major programmes, there is definitely further work to do around consenting and how that is delivered through nationally significant infrastructure projects. This is a fantastic Bill, but the next stage really is about delivery. The Government must now move from policy focus to delivery focus. We need to look at how we make Natural England and the nature restoration fund work. How we ensure that we work with partners from across the sector, from non-governmental organisations through to development organisations, will be critical in making the Bill work. I look forward to working with the Minister and the Department to ensure that it comes to fruition."
"I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 1713, the Agricultural Risk Review Act. My bill would make permanent the existing policy enacted under the Consolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2024 and bolster our food security against foreign adversaries. H.R. 1713 would amend the Defense Production Act to add the Secretary of Agriculture as a permanent member to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, for any transactions related to the purchase of farmland, biotechnology, or any other transaction related to the agricultural industry. My bill also includes the Safeguarding American Farms from Foreign Influence Act authored last Congress by the former chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on National Security, Mr. Luetkemeyer. That section of the bill requires CFIUS to consider referrals from USDA for reportable agricultural land transactions prior to the interagency process that determines whether review of the transaction is warranted. These bills received unanimous support when considered separately, and then when joined together were also reported favorably to the floor in a unanimous vote. These are commonsense measures in line with existing practices and current law. CFIUS' mandate is to review transactions involving foreign investments in the United States to ensure such transactions do not threaten our national security. Agriculture is too important to our country's security to be left out. Our geopolitical adversaries are eager to exploit vulnerabilities in critical supply chains, such as our food supply. The inclusion of the Secretary of Agriculture in reviews of agricultural transactions is just plain common sense.  {time}  1615  Mr. Speaker, my bill has been bipartisan across administrations. Former Agriculture Secretary Perdue under the first Trump administration and former Agriculture Secretary Vilsack under the Biden administration agreed that having a permanent seat at the table is vital to the protection of our farmland and food supply. I am also pleased to boast bipartisan support from the leadership of the House Financial Services Committee. This bill has passed unanimously out of the House Financial Services Committee for two Congresses now, and it is past time for it to become law. From Hawaii and Washington to New York and Florida to my home State of Oklahoma, our Nation's agricultural land must be protected. That is why a bipartisan group of Members from over 20 States across the country have supported me in this effort. I am grateful we took a positive step in the last Congress to include this language in our annual appropriations process, but we must cement this requirement in permanent law. This legislation recognizes and supports the long-held understanding that food supply is a critical component of U.S. national security. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill."
"Again, Mr. Chair, I cannot resist offering a question in return, and that question to all members on the opposition benches is this: Will they support this essential legislation? I am prepared to—"
"I will make some progress, thank you. I start by making the somewhat unusual case that this issue, for which we are gathered here on a Friday, giving up bake sales and constituency surgeries, is not quite the big deal it has been whipped up to be by both proponents and opponents. I do not believe that we are considering a fundamental change in the relationship between doctor and patient, or seeking to change the relationship between the state and the individual. I do not believe that we are stepping on to a slippery slope or unpicking the very purpose of the NHS, as some have suggested. We are here simply to give those who already face terrible decisions--doctors, patients and their families--a real choice of how to face those decisions, and protection in law for choices that are already being made today."
"Mr. Speaker, in 1957, the Allanburg Women's Institute asked the Ontario government to establish a university in Niagara, recognizing the immense value that a local university could provide to our youth and community. Our community's conviction was so deep that members of the CAW Local 199 in Niagara made weekly contributions from their hard-earned paycheques to support the founding of what would become Brock University in 1964. They understood then what we continue to recognize today: that post-secondary institutions are cornerstones of building communities, economic growth and supporting the development of a vibrant arts and cultural sector. With over 100,000 graduates, a commitment to industry-driven research and economic programs designed to meet the needs of today's and tomorrow's workforce, Brock University continues to fulfill the vision of its early champions. I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Brock University, its students, faculty, staff and alumni as they celebrate their 60th anniversary. Congratulations."
"China has state-sponsored media. North Korea has state-sponsored media. The United States does not need taxpayer-funded propaganda. Mr. Speaker, we have the opportunity this week to rescind a billion dollars that is in the pipeline right now for NPR and PBS, two outlets that routinely spew anti-American and anti-Christian propaganda. They sow racial division in this country, and they promote weird, woke values that most Americans find disgusting. Mr. Speaker, this is something that we have talked about for a long time, and finally, we have a President who is serious about rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse from the Federal Government. This is the perfect place to start. Let's pass this rescission bill. Let's end taxpayer-funded propaganda. Let's take our country back."
"Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague across the way on his maiden speech. There is a lot to unpack in it. There are a lot of questions with regard to this legislation. Notwithstanding the government's plans for the 26 million or 27 million vehicles on the roads as we speak, here is the question I have for my colleague across the way. When he was running to represent his constituents, did he tell them, with regard to the net-zero mandate, that their government would mandate that they could not purchase gas vehicles and had to purchase electric vehicles? If Liberals are so proud of this, why did they not run on it in their platform?"
"How could I not agree with my hon. Friend. We are proud of our airports--I am proud of mine in my constituency--which provide jobs and services. As everybody has said, they have a great history and provide great innovation, and we should celebrate them."
"Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's remarks and thank him for his speech. Unfortunately, he has missed the point of our motion. Our motion is not intended to attack electric vehicles. On the contrary, it is intended to give people the option to choose the type of vehicle they want to drive, based on their personal needs. The members says that the Conservative Party is disconnected from the reality of Quebeckers, yet just a few weeks ago, Pierre-Olivier Zappa showed how he had “disconnected” from the interest he had in electric vehicles. Does the member disagree with Liberal MNA Monsef Derraji, who said that it was utopian to say that this is a realistic objective, since it is becoming more and more unrealistic? Minister Benoit Charrette said that they have been saying from the start that they are not dogmatic and that they would reassess if it becomes apparent after several years that the market is not ready. That is exactly what our motion is doing. Why does the member make a distinction between what he thinks and what Quebeckers think?"
The hon. member.
"I rise today to congratulate the graduates of Stone Bridge High School's class of 2025. In their time as Bulldogs, this class has left a lasting legacy in the form of a mural to represent hope for the future. They excelled across a wide range of fields, including journalism, data science, and fine arts. Stone Bridge High School's orchestra program is one of the few recognized by the Virginia Band and Orchestra Association as a Program of Distinction. The students have left their mark on Stone Bridge High School. I look forward to watching all they accomplish in the future. I congratulate the Stone Bridge High School class of 2025. Mr. Speaker, they should celebrate this milestone and enjoy the journey ahead. They should thank their parents and teachers, as well.  Congratulating Tuscarora High School Class of 2025"
"Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise in the chamber on behalf of the people of Cambridge and North Dumfries, and to respond to the Speech from the Throne. As the first woman ever elected to represent this riding in Ottawa since Confederation, I carry that responsibility with deep gratitude and with a commitment to serve with heart and purpose. It is the community where I was born and raised, where I have raised my family and where I have spent my life giving back, whether by focusing on youth and seniors, supporting veterans or standing up for those who have no voice, including the victims of human trafficking. Through the years, I have seen our community grow, from the vibrant neighbourhoods of Galt, Preston and Blair, where the Grand River and the Speed River meet, connected by bridges, to the rural areas of North Dumfries: Ayr, Clyde and Branchton. It is a place of history. It is a place of natural beauty with a shared sense of community. It is a place where neighbours support each other and where small businesses want to put down roots and grow. Over the course of the campaign, we knocked on over 80,000 doors across Cambridge and North Dumfries. We listened on front porches, in driveways and at kitchen tables. People opened up and shared their stories, their struggles and their hopes for a better future. Along the way, I met people who have become friends, like Bonnie, whose kindness radiates in everything she does. She bakes pies and butter tarts for our local meal programs and crochets squares for blankets that help veterans settle into their new home. I remember meeting Susan, a senior living on a fixed income. She told me how, after paying her bills, there is often not enough left to buy the groceries she needs. It made me think of my own grandmother. Our family has an old photo of her standing in front of her fridge. The door was wide open, the shelves were full, and she had a huge smile on her face. For her, that fridge was not just about food; after she immigrated to Canada from a war-torn Eastern Europe, it was a symbol of safety, of having enough and of making sure no one in her family ever went hungry again. I also spoke with many young people, some just starting out in their careers and others finishing school, who told me they cannot see a future for themselves here. They want to stay close to family and contribute to the community they grew up in, but they cannot find jobs that pay enough to sustain them. One young man, an engineer, told me he is considering leaving Canada altogether, looking for opportunities abroad, because he no longer sees a future for himself in the country he calls home. He wants to build a life here, but with the rising cost of living and limited opportunities, he is starting to feel as if his dream is out of reach. Despite working hard, he cannot see a path to owning a home or starting a family. He is not alone. I have spoken with many young people in our community who feel the same. They are doing everything right, yet still feel like they are falling behind. My dad, at the age of 19, came to Canada for freedom and opportunity. The day after he arrived, he started a job as an electrician in the village of Ayr, where he was able to build that life, buy that home, and start a family. These are the very things so many young people today feel are no longer possible: that promise of a country where hard work is rewarded, rights are protected and each generation builds something better for the next. That is the promise I will help restore. That is the promise I will protect. In many conversations, I also heard a growing sense of worry. I grew up in a neighbourhood where we could leave our door unlocked. We would head downtown to Queen's Square, sit by the fountain and enjoy an ice cream on a warm summer afternoon. It was a time when people did not think twice about their safety. Today, that sense of safety is slipping away. Time and again, I heard people tell me they no longer feel secure, even with their doors locked. They worry about break-ins, thefts and the rise of violent crime on our streets. I spoke to parents who will not let their kids walk to the park alone anymore, to seniors who do not feel safe answering their door at night and to shop owners who have been targeted more than once. This is not just about statistics or headlines. It is about real people in real neighbourhoods feeling unsafe in the place they call home. It is about the loss of something we all deserve: peace of mind and the freedom to walk down the street or sit by the fountain and enjoy an ice cream without fear. There is a growing disconnect between the people and their government. At a time when many have lost faith in our institutions, the government must be reminded that it exists to serve the people, to be accountable, to be responsible and to have a plan. At constituents' doors, I also heard a sense of hope that we can restore what has been lost, rebuild what has been broken and renew the promise of Canada. That same hope, hard work and resilience carried me through many of life's challenges and will guide me every day in the House. Those experiences did not lead me to politics; they led me to people, and people led me here. I came to Ottawa to serve, to listen and to be a strong voice for the people of Cambridge and North Dumfries. I came here to support solutions that will build a Canada that works for everyone, a country where freedom is defended, opportunity is within reach and hope is restored. I want to help build a Canada where the promise of a better life is not just a dream but a promise every Canadian can believe in once again. This country has given my family everything, and now I intend to give back with everything I have. I will serve with honesty; I will lead with integrity, and I will never forget who sent me here. I want to take a moment to say thanks from the bottom of my heart. I thank my husband, Bill, whose love and support have been my constant through every challenge and every victory, for standing by me, for believing in me, even on the days when I doubted myself, and for reminding me why this work matters. I thank my two incredible daughters, who have been my inspiration from the very beginning. Watching them grow into strong, compassionate women has been the greatest gift of my life. I thank my five beautiful granddaughters; each of them is a bright light in my world. They are the reason I stand here today, fighting for a future where their dreams can take root and flourish right here at home. I thank my brother, who stood with me from the beginning, for his support and all his help. I thank my mom for her selfless love and the sacrifices only a mother makes. Everything I am began with her. I thank the many volunteers, neighbours and friends who gave their time, energy and hearts to this campaign. This journey was not mine alone; it belonged to all of us. Every door we knocked on, every conversation we had and every moment we shared mattered, and they shaped the person I am now. Finally, I thank the people of Cambridge and North Dumfries for sharing their stories and for welcoming me into their homes and lives. Every day in this chamber, I carry their struggles and hopes with me, humbled by the trust they have placed in me and fighting to make sure that every person can open their fridge with a smile, just as my grandmother once did."
"Mr. Chair, the department is working. There is a review ongoing to improve—"
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Finstad).
"Madam Speaker, as I rise to give my first member's statement in the House, I want to thank the people of Honoré‑Mercier for putting their trust in me. I am here thanks to them and thanks to a team of volunteers, friends and colleagues who believed in the vision of a stronger, fairer and more united Canada. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my wife and my two young daughters for joining me in this journey. Serving as a member of Parliament is an absolute privilege, but it comes with sacrifices, especially for those closest to us. On that note, I also wish to reach out to all members in the House and thank them for their service. I would like to thank their families for supporting them. I invite everyone to applaud if they feel thankful for their families playing a vital role in our democratic process."
"It is a sad day when the UK Government and the Governments of New Zealand, Australia, Canada and  Norway feel it necessary to sanction Government Ministers in the state of Israel, one of our closest allies, but it is the right thing to do. Can I, however, counsel the Minister, if I may be so presumptuous, against performative politics, and ask him how many mouths will be fed, how much violence against Palestinians in the west bank will be avoided or averted, and how much closer are we to achieving the two-state solution that we all want to see as a result of the action he has announced today?"
"No, I thought not. However, I very much enjoyed our time together on the Justice Committee, and I also enjoy his taking every bad point during these debates--although he should have been kinder to the distinguished former Lord Chancellor David Gauke, who, in my view, produced a very good report. As for the Minister, he is a very good friend of mine, and I thank him for his contributions. We know what a difficult job he has, but that will not stop us being on his back all the time to ensure that the many problems that have been identified today are resolved. Question deferred (Standing Order No"
"I rise to ask the question: Why are the Democrats so obsessed with allowing noncitizens to vote in our election? Why do they go out of their way to dilute the voices of American citizens, the very American citizens who elected them to represent them? It is incredibly frustrating to hear that they continue to double down or triple down on giving rights to people who are not citizens of this country at American taxpayers' and citizens' expense. The lead debater on the other side of the aisle said that it is not just Washington, D.C., that is looking to allow noncitizens to vote in our elections. Mr. Speaker, 20 municipalities--and guess what? They are all run by Democrats. In New York City, we had the same problem when the New York City Council passed legislation to allow noncitizens to vote in municipal elections. We had to sue to stop it, and we successfully did. It took not just one round in court, not just two rounds in court, but three rounds in court, where the city council and the mayor of New York used taxpayer money to continue to fight this each and every round despite being voted down in the New York State Supreme Court, the New York State Appellate Court, and, lastly, the New York Court of Appeals. By the way, all were Democrat appointees on that panel of judges. We still won because it is illegal. It is not constitutional for noncitizens to vote in our elections. Just like we fought this in New York City and prevailed, we will do the same here in Washington, D.C. We will make sure that they stop allowing and don't allow noncitizens to vote in their municipal elections because we are exercising our constitutional responsibility to protect our elections. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to continue to be strong and vote in support of this because we know that it passed overwhelmingly with bipartisan support last year. Fifty-two Democrats sided with Republicans. Those who continue to push for noncitizens to vote in our elections to dilute citizenship and dilute the voice of citizens in our elections should be ashamed of themselves. They should think about who actually elected them to represent their interests here today and why they continue to push to the contrary."
"I thank the Minister very much for his answers. He is always incredibly pleasant, and we appreciate that. Can he confirm that the 10-year strategy incorporates the need to enhance connectivity throughout the whole of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland? In particular, may I ask him about flights between Belfast and other major UK cities, which are becoming more costly by the day?"
"Mr. Chair, the Canadian Cancer Society said this week, “Cancer is already hard, accessing treatment shouldn't be.” Does the minister agree?"
What's it called?
"The hon. Member referred to the early release scheme as temporary. Is she 100% confident that it is a temporary scheme, and that the Government will not release more prisoners over the next few years?"
"Recent polling by WaterAid and YouGov shows that access to water, sanitation and hygiene is the No. 1 priority that the UK public want to see funded through UK aid. That makes sense, given that water underpins global health, keeps girls in school and builds climate-resilient communities. Does the Minister agree that it is one of the smartest and most cost-effective ways to deliver the UK's development goals? Without access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene, there can be no meaningful progress in any of those areas."
"Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the people of New Westminster—Burnaby—Maillardville for the incredible work they do, both locally and globally. In my riding, I have seen organizations having a real impact, from small businesses such as Kozak Ukrainian Eatery to faith-based groups such as Gurdwara Sahib Sukh Sagar. It is organizations like these that play a huge role in the community. Can the minister please share how our government is supporting groups like these to continue making a difference?"
"My hon. Friend raises an important point. Our cadets provide a good opportunity for our young people, and they should be supported and backed as much as possible. I am proud to have attended Monday's flag-raising ceremony in Victoria Square, in my constituency of Bolton North East. I was proud to see the strong showing of support for our armed forces at that ceremony, where the armed forces flag was raised above Bolton town hall. It will fly there proudly until the end of  Armed Forces Day on Saturday. The ceremony was an opportunity to reflect on those who have served and those who are currently serving, especially those deployed overseas and in active service. I was glad to join in celebrations with Jerry Mistry, president of the Royal Artillery Association's Bolton branch, and also members of the Royal Artillery, such as Gunner Paul Brindle. There are nearly 3,000 veterans in Bolton North East, and Bolton is also home to the 216th Battery of the 103rd Regiment of the Royal Artillery, which is the most northerly sub-unit of the 103rd Regiment, with lineage dating back to 1889. I am deeply proud of our local military history, but on Monday I also heard concerns from members of the 216th Battery about a lack of funding, particularly around general training, meaning that there is not enough money to progress training levels. I sincerely hope that the Government will look at ways to provide more support on that. I am also a former employee of the Royal British Legion, and as someone with experience campaigning to improve the lives of our armed forces, I strongly welcome this Government's commitment to renewing the nation's contract with those who serve and those who have served. Having worked on raising awareness about the armed forces covenant, I am pleased that this Labour Government recognise its importance in supporting our armed forces communities and that we have committed to enacting it in law. However, what plans do the Minister and his Department have in place to ensure that sufficient funding and budget is in place to implement an extension of the armed forces covenant duty? How do the Government intend to work with different layers of local government and our regional mayors? As a parent, I welcome plans to expand wraparound childcare to support families deployed overseas, and I was pleased to hear that they will now receive 20 hours a week of funded childcare, saving families around PS3,400 a year. I strongly commend the Minister and this Government on broadening support to our armed forces families, because I have experienced at first hand how much they struggle and the unique challenges they face."
"Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of a crisis the likes of which Canada has rarely seen in the past 50 years. Leadership means having a clear vision and moving swiftly to implement measures that will protect Canadians. The bill lays out the role of the minister who is responsible for making decisions and who is also responsible for consulting with provincial counterparts, indigenous communities and other ministers before drawing up a list of criteria. Respect for all existing legislation passed by the House is baked into the bill."
"Mr. Speaker, as my colleague mentioned, we have various concerns about the form and the substance. I will get back to that in a speech in a few minutes. In my colleague's opinion, what happens when bills are put forward that have so many implications and consequences for the future and the time isn't taken to listen to citizens, municipalities, the provinces, scientists, environmentalists and first nations?"
"It is well beyond my remit as safeguarding Minister to make asylum policy, but I can absolutely guarantee the hon. Lady that migrant women and their experiences will be part of the violence against women and girls strategy; this issue has received some of the money from the recent uplift in victim services. Working together with by-and-for services across the country, we will always take account of the experiences of all women and girls in our country."
"Mr. Speaker, as I was listening, I could not help but be inspired by the member's personal story of growing up in the United Kingdom. She mentioned her interaction with the Sovereign. I, too, was fortunate to have a brief interaction. I appreciate her comments, her connection and the way that Canada's constitution runs through the United Kingdom, but also that we have diversity across this country. I wanted to pick up on the remarks that the member made about housing. She rightly identified the fact that the government is removing the GST on homes up to $1 million for first-time homebuyers. I think that is a really important policy. The Conservative Party, to its credit, actually did include this in its platform, but the difference is that it would fund that by getting rid of things like the housing accelerator fund and the rapid housing initiative, a lot of the federal support to build new houses. Yes, the Conservatives would have made a tax cut, but it would have been for a lot fewer people because the homes would not be there. Would the member care to comment on the fact that she sees that as perhaps problematic?"
"Madam Speaker, I have a very simple question. It is not a partisan question. It is actually an issue that is affecting a lot of constituents. When the ways and means motion was introduced, it was effective immediately that day. If one had purchased, or had agreed to purchase, a newly built house the day before, even if they were not to be taking possession for a year or two from then, and paying the GST then, they would be cut off. They would still be forced to pay the GST, even though we missed it by one day and even though we would not be purchasing or even building the house for a year or so. I was just wondering if the member opposite would work with her government to bring in some measures to help those people who had the misfortune of, perhaps, signing the deal one day before the Liberals actually tabled the motion, therefore being forced to pay the GST."
It is a long-standing position that that is for a competent court to determine.
"Mr. Chair, does he intend to?"
"I will close by saying I do think this is an important bill for avoiding fraud. I am very concerned about fraud on these dating service apps. I commend Mr. Valadao for bringing this forward, and I urge everyone to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."
What progress his Department has made on developing an industrial strategy.
What steps he is taking to help reduce employment costs for employers.
I will have to stop the minister there. The hon. member for Calgary Signal Hill.
"Mr. Speaker, when I was knocking on doors in Newfoundland and Labrador, it was very common for Canadians to say they were not voting because all politicians are corrupt. I heard my fellow colleague mention corruption. I wonder if she may see the bill, Bill C-5 , as perhaps leading to more corruption."
"I rise to speak in strong support of new clause 122, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire and Bedworth (Rachel Taylor). I am proud to be the first signatory to it, as I believe it represents a vital step forward in the protection of some of the most marginalised people in our society. New clause 122 would amend the Crime and Policing Bill to create aggravated offences where the underlying crime is motivated by hostility because of a person's sexual orientation, transgender identity, disability or perceived identity. It would align the legal treatment of those forms of hate with the framework that already exists for racially and religiously aggravated offences. It delivers on a promise, a promise that we in the Labour party made in our manifesto to the British people: that we would act to close the gap in our hate crime laws and provide equal protection to LGBT+ people and disabled people in the criminal justice system. It is about living  up to our values. Labour is the party of equality, fairness before the law and standing with those whose voices have too often been ignored. That is why I joined the Labour party and this amendment is rooted in that tradition. It is also fitting that we are tabling this new clause in Pride Month and in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling which has caused so much anguish among the trans community. We know the scale of the problem. Hate crimes based on sexual orientation have risen by 112% over the last five years. Against trans people, that figure is 186%. The charity Galop, which supports LGBT+ victims of abuse, saw a 60% increase in referrals in the last year alone. In the year ending March 2024, 11,719 disability hate crime incidents were reported. Shamefully, just 1% of that hate crime involving violence resulted in a charge. And yet, still, the majority of incidents go unreported. Too many victims still believe the system is not on their side. New clause 122 gives us the opportunity to change that. It would give police and prosecutors a clearer route to charge and convict offenders in a way that truly reflects the nature of these crimes. I know what it means to think twice about how you walk down a street, to pause before holding someone's hand, and to wonder whether that shout from across the road is something that you can ignore or that you cannot afford to ignore. And I know I am not alone in that. I have spoken to my constituents and to people from far beyond, who tell me they do not feel safe reporting hate when it happens. They do not believe they will be taken seriously. There is a profound failure of trust, one that we in this House have a duty to repair. This is also about dignity. It is about recognising that, whether you are a trans teenager being punched in a park, a gay couple being spat at on the tube, or a disabled man being harassed on his way to work, all people deserve the full protection of the law. They deserve to know that this country is on their side, and that if they are targeted for who they are, justice will not look the other way. New clause 122 would provide vital protection for disabled people, who remain far too invisible in the public conversation around hate crime despite facing damaging harassment, violence and abuse every single day. This change is recommended by the Law Commission and supported by Stonewall, Galop and Disability Rights UK. I am proud that it is backed by 104 right hon. and hon. Members across the House. People are simply asking to live their lives in peace and have the right support when things go wrong. I hope we can take a step forward in advancing LGBT+ rights and disability rights today."
"I am very pleased that we were able to make this multi-year commitment on coal tip safety. The Government provided money for this in last year's spending review, but that was for just one year, and today we have been able to give certainty that money will be available for the vital work that is necessary. I thank my hon. Friend for welcoming it; it is a shame that Plaid Cymru did not. My hon. Friend has been a staunch supporter of reform of the miners' pension scheme. We made reforms in the Budget last year, but I will ensure that the relevant Minister meets him to discuss what more we can do to secure a fair pension for miners in retirement."
"I rise today to recognize and celebrate an extraordinary achievement by a remarkable individual from my district, Divonte Lumpkin, a dedicated Assistant Coach for the Walter H. Dyett High School for the Arts boys' basketball team, the Eagles. This team achieved a historic victory, winning the 2024-2025 Illinois High School Association (IHSA) Class 2A State Championship with a decisive 52-41 win over Althoff Catholic High School on March 15, 2025. This championship is more than just a win on the court; it is a profound testament to the resilience, determination, and unity of the Dyett High School community and the vibrant Bronzeville neighborhood. A decade ago, Dyett faced the threat of closure, but through powerful community advocacy and unwavering commitment, its doors remained open. Today, the Eagles' triumph. shaped significantly by the guidance and mentorship of coaches like Divonte Lumpkin, symbolizes the incredible potential that flourishes when a community invests in its youth and its institutions. Assistant Coach Divonte Lumpkin, alongside Head Coach Jamaal Gill, II, provided invaluable leadership, strategic insight, and unwavering support throughout the season. His dedication to developing these young athletes, both on and off the court, was instrumental in fostering the skill, discipline, and teamwork that led to this historic victory. His hard work and commitment were integral to the team's success, culminating in this well-deserved championship that brings immense pride and joy to the school, the players, their families, and the entire community. Mr. Speaker, Divonte Lumpkin' contribution to the Dyett Eagles' journey from near closureto state champions is an inspiring narrative for us all. It underscores the critical importance of dedicated educators and mentors in supporting our public schools and empowering young people to achieve their fullest potential. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Assistant Coach Ron Thomas and the entire Dyett High School boys' basketball team on their momentous achievement and a honoring them for the inspiration they provide to communities across our Nation."
"I recognise the appetite in the Chamber to hear more about the ICJ advisory opinion. It was a far-reaching and complex judgment, and we are taking our time with our response."
"Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Secretary of State for Rural Development—"
"Mr. Speaker, I am here at the behest of the members. Members voted for us to be here at 9:55 p.m. I am making myself available to the House to answer members' questions, especially questions from my Bloc Québécois colleagues, whom I hold in high esteem."
"Mr. Chair, the one Canadian economy act allows the government to choose which projects will be exempted from Bill C-69 and the non-competitive industrial carbon tax. If the government is going to exempt some projects, why not exempt them all?"
"Mr. Speaker, there is no way on God's green earth that Bill C-5 is ready for passage. Concerns and alarms have been raised by every environmental law association in Canada, by the Climate Action Network and now by the grand chief of the Assembly of First Nations. The Canadian Cancer Society has pointed out that the interprovincial barriers that come down may lead to a race to the bottom on health and environmental risks. Will the government please redraft and reintroduce a bill that has a hope of passage?"
"Mr. Chair, it is not a personal question. It is a simple question on whether or not the minister is willing to grant him honorary citizenship. The government put in the program for caregivers, and many of them were actually unable to to finish the process when the system crashed. Will the minister provide alternatives for those applicants?"
"I include in the Record the following newsletter to give an update to my constituents on the budget reconciliation process, reforming our education system, and bills that have been introduced:  Dear Friend, Congress is working through a budget reconciliation process to: Keep taxes low for families and small businesses Strengthen our borders Bolster our economy Support domestic energy production Make the federal government more effective and efficient for the American people As a member of the House Budget Committee, I helped craft a budget resolution that is serving as the framework to accomplish an agenda that puts America First. Now that this budget resolution has passed out of the House, it is up to the Senate to move it forward so that we can deliver on the priorities that an overwhelming number of Americans have been asking for. We are at a pivotal moment in which we can pave the way to implement significant changes in policies to get our nation back on track, and I will continue to support opportunities to make life better for Western North Carolinians. Strengthening and protecting our education systems: President Trump took a major step forward in reforming out education system by signing an executive order to shut down the Department of Education. This order paves the way for education authorities to finally be back in the hands of the states and parents who know what their students need to succeed best. The historically high tax dollars funding the department have not paid off, with repeatedly low test scores among students, and it's time that we take a hard look at the root causes that are preventing students from achieving their potential. The House is also working to protect our education system with the passage of the Defending Education Transparency and Ending Rogue Regimes Engaging in Nefarious Transactions Act (DETERRENT Act). I voted for this bill to strengthen oversight and disclosure requirements for gifts and contracts with foreign donors or entities. If a foreign entity is found to be of concern, for example--if they are connected with the Chinese Communist Party--then this bill allows for contracts with those concerning entities to be banned. The CCP should not have the ability to influence our higher education institutions or students through expensive gifts and large donations. This bill will stop the infiltration and influence of bad actors on college and university campuses and make our education systems more transparent by staying focused on the core mission--preparing America's youth for the workforce. Bringing contaminated properties back to life in our mountains: Many investors who are interested in developing properties that have environmental challenges decide not to invest because the cost of cleanup exceeds the business' benefit. Due to the challenges associated with cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, contaminated properties will sit unoccupied for years. The current Opportunity Zone program, which offers tax incentives for investors to redevelop areas that are designated as ``Opportunity Zones,'' focuses solely on low- income communities and fails to consider the need for similar investment in communities with additional hardships, such as brownfields and Superfund sites. To address this overlooked issue, I introduced the bipartisan Economic Opportunity for Distressed Communities Act, to designate all Superfund and brownfield areas as Opportunity Zones and to encourage the clean-up, redevelopment, and revitalization of these contaminated sites. If cleaned, brownfields and Superfund sites can be redeveloped into new housing or business space, and promoting cleanup and development of these sites will create jobs, business opportunities, and increase property values in Western North Carolina and nationwide. Supporting small businesses in the aftermath of disaster: The destruction left by Hurricane Helene has forced many Western North Carolinians to depend on federal resources to rebuild their homes and businesses. One obstacle that stands in the way of recovery is a current law that restricts hurricane survivors from double- dipping in the disaster aid system by prohibiting folks from receiving a ``duplication of benefits.'' Unfortunately, wrapped up in this law is limitation from accessing federal loans and federal grants for the same disaster. That means if a business owner receives a federal disaster recovery loan from the Small Business Administration, they are ineligible to receive a federal recovery grant from the $1.65 billion Community Development Block Grant--Disaster Recovery funding that I authored and secured in the American Relief Act. Even though SBA loans are required to be repaid and CDBG-DR grants are one-time payments to victims that do not require repayment, the federal government views the two as a ``duplication of benefits.'' That's why I introduced the Helene Small Business Recovery Act, which would temporarily waive loans from being considered as a duplication of benefits for disasters occurring in calendar year 2023 or 2024. This clarification would provide an exemption to the duplication of benefits issue for all WNC businesses that received an SBA loan from Hurricane Helene. Hurricane Helene caused nearly $60 billion in damage in WNC's mountains, and the state of North Carolina estimates at least $30 billion of the damage was to the economy and housing. With damage far exceeding currently available resources, our communities must be able to access every possible dollar appropriated for Helene recovery. Congress must pass this bill so that disaster survivors are not restricted from accessing critical federal aid needed to sustain our region's businesses and keep our families in our mountains. Now accepting Congressional Art Competition submissions: The 2025 Congressional Art Competition is open, and my office is accepting submissions from high school students living in North Carolina's 11th congressional district. The winner of the competition will have their artwork displayed in the U.S. Capitol for one year. After the Congressional Art Competition winner is selected by a panel of judges, I'll also hold a ``Facebook Favorite'' competition posted on my official Facebook page, @RepChuckEdwards, for Western North Carolinians to vote for their favorite piece of art. The annual Congressional Art Competition is a great way for students in WNC to showcase their talent, creativity, and passion, and I hope you'll share this with a high school artist whom you know. For details about the competition requirements and to submit your artwork, visit edwards.house.gov/artcompetition or contact my Hendersonville office with further questions. With my warmest regards, Chuck Edwards, Member of Congress."
I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).
"Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak about Bill C‑3 , and specifically about citizenship and immigration. Citizenship and obtaining it can be a sensitive topic as it can inflame passions for various reasons. There are Canadian citizens who, like me, were born in Canada. There are people who immigrated here and wanted to settle in a country that offered them a way out of poverty or work opportunities. There are different reasons for wanting to live in Canada and become a Canadian. Today, we are talking about Bill C‑3. People listening to us need to understand that if, one day, a Canadian decides to move to another country, any country, settle down and have children there, those children will have Canadian citizenship. That system and that right exist. No matter whether they move for work or to settle down elsewhere, those children could be Canadians. However, Bill C‑3 proposes that those children, who have never lived in Canada, who have always lived abroad, will be able, at the age of 20 or 30 years, to give their own child Canadian citizenship, when that child has no ties to our country. The father, the mother, the grandfather or grandmother decided to live abroad, so they have no ties here, but they, not to mention their own children, and so on, would automatically get Canadian citizenship. That is the direction we are heading in. The Liberal government wants to pass this bill even though no one has any idea of the number of individuals living abroad who would automatically be entitled to Canadian citizenship. There would be some people among those entitled to a Canadian passport who would wonder where Canada is on a map. Does everyone understand how stupid that is? At some point, we need to take back control over immigration. As we know, there are already huge problems in this country. The last 10 years have been a disaster in terms of the Liberal government's management of immigration. This is particularly true when it comes to asylum seekers because of Justin Trudeau's famous tweet in January 2017, which we all remember. He invited the world to come to Canada. We saw how that turned out. There are currently 600,000 people in Quebec, including 150,000 who have claimed asylum, whose cases have not even been processed or finished being processed. We therefore have a lot of problems to solve in managing immigration in order to restore an immigration system that is fair, honest and efficient for people who want to come to Canada. Bill C‑3 will give citizenship to people who have no ties to Canada. It makes no sense. It is very difficult to understand. We can imagine a situation where a child or grandchild of a Canadian who moved 50 years ago may have a criminal record in their country, but they would be entitled to a Canadian passport. There is currently nothing in the bill that would prevent criminals, or even terrorists, from being granted Canadian citizenship. That is unacceptable. That is why we strongly oppose it. In terms of overall immigration to Canada, for years we have been calling on the House to exercise better border control; in fact, I was always the first to do so. I remember being insulted and called racist by former prime minister Trudeau and other ministers because I was raising an issue of public safety and population control. People were coming here because of the infamous tweet. For many years, people took advantage of the situation at Roxham Road. They were not coming here from a country that was being bombed; they were crossing over from the U.S. The government has created a situation where the Canadian immigration system has been unable to manage files properly. Other issues have been created. People have been here for several years because it takes two years to get a first meeting. If they are rejected, they can appeal, and they enter a never-ending system. Some of these people have children who were born in Canada and who are therefore Canadians. In five, six or seven years' time, however, they might be told that their lives are no longer in danger, that they arrived from the United States, or that they have no ground to claim asylum in Canada and must therefore go back home. This creates other problems, such as having Canadian children, and so on. We are calling for quick action to take back control of Canadian territory. As I said earlier, 600,000 people are currently living in Quebec on a temporary visa, work permit or study permit, along with asylum seekers. They are having a major impact on Quebec's health care system, education system and housing situation. In fact, the current housing shortage is partly due to groups of people who are here for no acceptable reason. The government is not equipped to process files or ensure that people who set foot on our shores without a valid reason are sent back home. The system is either broken or too slow. At the same time, there are other immigrants who are settled and working, but who are waiting for their permits to be renewed. They are under an incredible amount of stress. I know this is happening to many of my colleagues, but at my constituency office alone, there are 10 or 15 people coming in every day looking for information. They are waiting for their renewal, unable to speak to anyone. They are not getting notified that the waiting period has been extended. It lands on us, in our constituency offices, to do the work normally done by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada staff. This is not right. The machinery is completely broken. It is not the civil servants' fault because everything was fine, basically. Prior to 2015, immigration to Canada was running smoothly. There were economic immigrants and refugees coming to the country. Immigration was being managed perfectly. Then the system completely derailed in recent years. To remedy the situation, we must now also help the officials. They had to deal with a situation that was initially created by Roxham Road. Permits were then handed out by the federal government. Take Quebec, for example. The federal government ignored Quebec's priorities and decided to grant permits to people, supposedly to attend school. It turns out that these people are fake students. What they basically wanted was to come here and then claim asylum so that they could stay. That is compounding the problem. What is needed are strict, concrete measures with a clear message from the government so that the officials who have to process these cases can do so quickly. When decisions are made, especially about people who have no business in this country, and when they are asked to leave, the decisions need to be carried out. Things cannot be left in limbo forever. We are therefore urging the government to stop trying to give citizenship to people who have never lived in Canada or who have no connection to the country, and to start dealing with those who have already entered Canada. Those who deserve to be here should be treated well and should be taken care of properly. Those who had no business coming here should go back home. That is how it should work. Canada's immigration system needs to be fixed. The last thing we need is to pass legislation such as Bill C‑3 ."
"The killing of civilians at aid distribution centres in Gaza is horrifying. Israel must fulfil its obligations under international law to ensure unhindered humanitarian assistance. I will not speculate about future sanctions or arms embargoes, but we continue to engage with our partners and will not hesitate to take further action if the Government of Israel do not change course."
"I ask, what happened? My hometown, Santa Ana, California, is predominantly Hispanic Latino. Factory workers live there. Remember, we are the biggest manufacturing State in the Union. Nearshoring, guess where it is happening? California is the largest ag State in the Union. There are a lot of farmworkers in my district. What happened? One day, we are going about our business in Santa Ana, Orange County, masked Federal agents start going into our neighborhoods, picking up hardworking neighbors. Oh, yeah, you bet, people were concerned, scared, and nervous. A lot of people expressed their First Amendment rights. We got the National Guard. Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes did not call for the National Guard. Local police chiefs did not call for the National Guard. We get the National Guard. President Trump promised to deport criminals, those with deportation orders, those here less than 2 years, but now it is hard workers, people who pay taxes that are being picked up. Mr. Speaker, 60 percent of those being picked up are now people without criminal records. Orange County didn't have any violence. We had masked officers coming into our neighborhoods. I bet President Trump would want to know what is going on on Main Street. One of the constituents that just got picked up I talked about a minute ago, Narciso Barranco. He has been in the U.S. for 25 years. He is a gardener and a father of three marines. We make movies of people like this. This gentleman is a hero. His family are heroes. Instead, he is in an ICE holding facility in Los Angeles. I am hearing more stories coming, more Barranco-type families being broken up, military families being separated from their loved ones by ICE. I do not believe President Trump would want his legacy to be that he deported military family members like Mr. Barranco. Let's use common sense here. This resolution is not prime time for a vote. There are a lot of inaccuracies. I am going to ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this measure."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this is an odd notion that we have heard repeatedly, that the violence was only concentrated in part of L.A. and that we need to zoom out and look at the city as a whole. For the folks who had to deal with this chaos in downtown L.A., it is little comfort to them that things might have been more serene in Beverly Hills. My colleague from California uses the term ``hellscape'' for L.A. I am not sure I would use that term. I can say that L.A. has had a lot of problems, so much so that the sheriff's department even had to come out and tell folks not to wear their jewelry when they go outside, to just put it on after they get to their destination. As to the assertion that somehow this is a made-for-TV spectacle created by the President, I ask what made for more sensational TV images, the Waymos being set on fire and the Molotov cocktails being thrown at officers, which is to say that the things that happened before the National Guard got there, or our dedicated National Guard members standing outside Federal buildings, making sure that no further damage to property and life occurred? Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"Mr. Speaker, I did what needed to be done in December. It was a hard thing to do, but it was the right thing to do for our party and for our country. I was very proud, in the past election, to campaign under the banner of our new Prime Minister . I am very proud to be advancing legislation that will do what I said in my resignation letter we needed to do, and that is build Canada in response to the U.S. tariffs."
"Mr. Speaker, my colleague and I do great work together at the committee, and I hope to continue that. We have to be careful in ramming things through this place. He is not wrong. We do need to deal with this issue. We need to get the amendments that we want out. We need to speak about it and have that debate, yet I hesitate to agree to push it through quickly because that is how mistakes get made. This bill has potential long-term implications for Canadians with the ability to confer citizenship generation after generation. I do believe we need to give it its due consideration. As the member pointed out, we have many other major issues. The immigration system is badly broken, with many problems that need to be examined. I can certainly imagine that the immigration committee is going to be very consumed with all kinds of issues because of the broken system that the Liberals created."
"If the hon. Lady had listened carefully to my statement, she would know that I said we will be announcing further details on the strategy later this year."
"The hon. Gentleman makes a really important point. We have heard time and again--we heard it in relation to life sciences, defence and clean energy--that we have some of the best thinkers in the world, but they often struggle to get the start-up finance or the scale-up finance they need to turn those ambitions into new businesses. As someone who spent four years building a business before I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and got elected to this House, I know that what small businesses need to grow are sales. That is why we need to be doing a much smarter job of  marrying public contracts with access to scale-up finance, but that will take the institutions we have today working very differently in the future. Perhaps our most shocking evidence session was on the subject of public procurement, when the chief commercial officer of His Majesty's Government was just not clear how many jobs, how much economic growth and what levels of wages were driven by PS1 of GDP. That is simply not good enough. I hope that there is cross-party consensus about these reforms because, ultimately, this is a once in 50 years moment. Our recommendations should command cross-party support, because that is how we ensure that they are sustainable for the long term."
"I rise today to recognize Dr. Kiara Kuenzler of Denver, Colorado for being named the Nexstar 2025 Remarkable Woman of Denver. During her 7-year tenure as President and CEO, Dr. Kuenzler positioned the Jefferson Center for Mental Health as a leading community provider by expanding access to services and growing the Center's workforce across the region. Dr. Kuenzler recognized the need to bring mental health services to people where they were at, so she created partnerships with schools, medical practices, law enforcement, and others to facilitate more than 150 outposts for substance use disorder care. She grew the Center's workforce by over 300 employees and improved access to treatment for over 25,000 Coloradans in the Front Range to ensure those in rural communities could access care. Dr. Kuenzler earned this honor because of her dedication to expanding mental health care services and her passion for helping people overcome obstacles in their lives. She'll be remembered as an important part of the Jefferson Center's legacy. On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District, it is my honor to congratulate Dr. Kiara Kuenzler for being recognized as the ``2025 Remarkable Woman of Denver.''"
I thank the Secretary of State for her statement. I wonder if she will reflect on whether the Bill before us tomorrow is the best way of making welfare policy. Would it not be better to withdraw the Bill and wait for the Timms review to complete its important work?
"Mr. Speaker, I welcome the member opposite. It has always puzzled me how sometimes the members across hold themselves up as these great economic masters and stewards who have all the economic answers. Let us look at some economic facts. Inflation has gone down from 8.1% in June 2022 to 1.7%. We have an AAA Moody's credit rating, a debt-to-GDP ratio that is the best in the G7, the lowest debt in the G7 and the lowest deficit in the G7. Workforce or labour force participation is at 65.3%, versus the U.S. at 62.5%. Sure, we have challenges, but our economy is strong. The fundamentals are strong and we have a Prime Minister who can build the strongest economy in the G7. My question is this: Do we not deserve credit for driving inflation down to 1.7%, below Bank of Canada expectations?"
"Mr. Speaker, I always find it somewhat interesting that we have the NDP here in the House, and then there are NDP governments, whether it is in British Columbia or Manitoba. Wab Kinew has been absolutely fantastic, recognizing the value of legislation of this nature. The former premier of Alberta Rachel Notley was a very strong advocate for the importance of pipelines. Then we get the NDP members here in Ottawa, who continue to go to the far extreme left. I know there are leadership ambitions, potentially, on the other side. Does the member not recognize that the legislation we have before us today is good for all Canadians? Why would she not support the principles of the legislation?"
"Mr. Chair, I will be splitting my time three ways. During the election, the Prime Minister said he would collect $20 billion in U.S. tariffs. Can the minister confirm on what date they will be fully collected?"
"We have announced plans to tighten up the regulation of those who transport and manage waste, moving them from a light-touch regime into a permitted system, which gives the Environment Agency a greater range of powers. It will also introduce the possibility of up to five years in prison for those who breach the new laws."
"Mr. Speaker, one thing that troubles me about this program is what I hear frequently in my constituency office. People come in and say, “The government said this was a free program and that my dental expenses were now covered, but they were not covered.” One of my questions is, why did the government do such a poor job rolling this out, misleading people to think that all of their dental care was going to be free? The other one is, would it not have been nice to present a budget to the House so we could know what we can afford and what we cannot?"
"Mr. Speaker, I think the Bloc Québécois needs to understand that the Prime Minister 's role is to be able to talk to everyone, whether they are in the aluminum, steel, clean energy or conventional energy sectors. That is the job of the Prime Minister, which no Bloc Québécois member will never be. That said, what is most important right now is that we want to build. We are going to invest in major infrastructure projects. For Quebec, one of the fundamental infrastructure projects is the high-speed train between Windsor and Quebec City, something the Bloc Québécois should support."
That is a perfect place to pause as we move on to questions and comments. The hon. member for Sudbury has the floor.
"Mr. Chair, on the MLI select program, I can get the member some detailed information about those questions. I would be happy to do that."
"Mr. Speaker, the German ambassador said again yesterday that he still wants to import our natural gas. With Bill C‑69 and Bill C‑48 , the production cap and the industrial carbon tax, this Liberal government is stifling our economic growth with its anti-energy measures. When will the Liberal Prime Minister finally allow Canadians to build pipelines, help our allies and benefit from Canada's resources by scrapping his anti-development agenda once and for all?"
"A full-scale war between Israel and Iran is clearly in no one's interests, but neither is a nuclear-armed Iran, so what is the Government's realistic proposal to return to diplomatic solutions as soon as possible and to get Iran to give up its nuclear weapons programme? How realistic is it that Iran will engage in such an effort?"
"Mr. Speaker, as a female MP, I would like to take up the point that my colleague from Madawaska—Restigouche made. Not all colleagues elected to the House are exceptional. I think there is a petition going around against one of his colleagues that was launched by a group of women. My colleague is a scholar, he is educated and he knows what “exceptional” means. When he said that, it had an impact on me as a woman. Perhaps he might reconsider his comment. I would like my colleague to tell me why the Liberals were against the amendments that call for the provinces and Quebec to be consulted."
"I will deal directly with two of the questions raised because it is important to provide reassurance. The right hon. Lady asks what will happen with the estate of someone who is deceased. I want to be clear that His Majesty's Revenue and Customs will never pursue any estate for the winter fuel payment alone. She also asks about the level of savings. As I set out in my statement, the savings will be PS450 million a year in England and Wales. That is very clear, and it is a significant saving. More broadly, the hon. Lady talks about an apology. She comes here representing the party of Liz Truss and lectures anybody else about apologies; she comes here representing the party of flatlining wages, rising debt and a 200,000 increase in pensioners in poverty, and asks anybody else to apologise. I have never heard such nonsense. We have listened to pensioners. For all her sound and fury--she was at her most furious today--I still  cannot tell what the Conservatives' policy is, 11 months on. For all the rhetoric and shouting, it sounds like she might support the means-testing of winter fuel payments. After all, that was the policy of her party's leader, who once also supported means-testing the entire state pension in one of her bolder moments. Conservative Members say that the policy is not much comfort to pensioners, but Age UK says the exact opposite: charity director Caroline Abrahams said that this announcement is ""the right thing to do"". Martin Lewis says that it is a ""big improvement"". [Interruption.] There is a lot of chuntering from the Conservative Front Benchers. Maybe their Back Benchers can work out what the Front-Bench policy is by the time they get to their feet in a few minutes' time. I have no idea whatsoever what the Conservative party's policy is. More widely, when it comes to pensioners, the Government's priorities are to raise the state pension and rescue the NHS. The triple lock will see state pension spending rise by PS31 billion annually over this Parliament. Some PS26 billion is being invested into the NHS because we inherited in England a disgraceful situation in which more than one in five pensioners aged over 75 were on waiting lists. There is no excuse for that legacy from the Conservative party. Neither of those forms of progress--raising the state pension and investing in the NHS--would be possible without the difficult decisions that we have had to make on tax. Those are difficult decisions that every Opposition party has opposed. Only this Government can provide that crucial support for pensioners, because we will do what is necessary to turn that support from rhetoric into reality."
"Mr. Speaker, I believe if you seek it you will find consent to apply the results from the previous vote to this vote, with the Liberals voting in favour."
"On 6 January, I raised with the Minister in this Chamber the fact that refurbishing Typhoons will not touch the sides of maintaining the 6,000-strong workforce at Warton, in my constituency, and that relying on export orders that have not been secured will not keep the workforce in work for now, before the GCAP comes online. When I asked the Minister whether she would give a delayed Christmas present of an order for 25 Typhoons, she replied: ""It might not be a Christmas present--I do not know when his birthday is--but a present some time later.""--[Official Report, 6 January 2025; Vol. 586.] We were awaiting an order of Typhoons for the Warton site in the strategic defence review, but it turned out to contain an empty box instead of a present. If the Minister was not simply buying time and giving false hope to the workforce then, when will we see the order of 25 Typhoon jets for the RAF?"
"Mr. Speaker, as the chief whip of the Bloc Québécois, I too would like to take this opportunity to thank the other members of the House. Although we do not always agree, we still manage to get things done. We have also been much better at moving issues forward over the past month than in previous months. I would also like to thank you, Mr. Speaker, and your team of Deputy Speakers, who learned their duties quickly and are doing a great job. I would also like to thank the team of House clerks and all the employees who work with them. We in the Bloc Québécois appreciate them. I think that the House of Commons staff in general are aware of this. We greatly appreciate the outstanding and impeccable service that is being delivered in this Parliament. It was a pleasant surprise for most of us when we arrived. That is just a comment. I would also like to thank the people in the Parliamentary Protective Service. The service's 10th anniversary has already been highlighted. These are people who dedicate themselves to protecting us. That means a lot. We appreciate that, we thank them, and we wish them continued success. I would also like to thank the maintenance staff and the janitors we meet in our offices. We are often in a hurry and may not always greet them, but they deserve our respect. If they were not here, we would not be here. What we do on Parliament Hill is a group effort, so I would like to thank everyone. I hope I have not forgotten any groups. Of course, I have to end with the most important group for us francophones: the interpreters. Despite the sometimes heated debates, where people are talking at the same time, the interpreters do an extraordinary job, of impeccable quality. It is truly impressive to see the extent to which they can convey, in real time, what are sometimes highly complex or technical remarks, especially at committee meetings. I did not mention the staff assigned to committees. I think they are included in the House staff. I wish all of these people a very good summer. We are off to celebrate Quebec's national holiday. I wish Canadians everywhere a happy Canada Day. See you again next fall."
"Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to be able to rise on an issue as important as a bill that deals with Canada's border. I have been among those people sounding the alarm for years about the Liberal government's inaction on the border. When there has been action, it was action that aggravated and exacerbated the problems. These are long-standing challenges caused by a Liberal government that, despite its proclamations, is not a new government but a continuation of what we had over the last 10 years. While I am heartened by the fact that the Liberals have acknowledged there is a border crisis, I have a great many concerns with the way they have chosen to tackle that. Let me be clear: One of the biggest issues, in my media career, I would frequently criticize the government's handling of was the lax approach to border security. One notable example of this was allowing Roxham Road to balloon into a full-blown illegal immigration scheme that the government turned a blind eye to. This was something that happened for years and years, and the government would not act. Issues pertaining to smuggling of firearms, drugs and even people have been allowed to become the crisis they are today. While I am grateful that the Liberals have decided to come to the party late, I have to ask why it took so long. What prevented them from taking action on this? Let me be perfectly clear that a lot of the issues we see with crime and drugs in our country, including gang violence using illegal firearms smuggled in across the border, are issues that cannot just be neatly siloed off into one particular portfolio. Conservatives have been asking the Liberals for the last couple of weeks why there is nothing in the bill that deals with sentencing for fentanyl kingpins. Why is there nothing that deals with bail issues that allow repeat offenders to continue to be out on the street after offending? The Liberals have always come back to the same position, which is that it is just a border bill, not a crime bill, but that is a very narrow and naive way of looking at the legislation. They do not understand that these cross-border issues are integrally connected to the crime and justice issues that they are not acknowledging, that they are not acting on and that the bill has no solutions for. On this, I will say that I am grateful the government has taken some suggestions that the Conservatives have made over the years and put them in the bill, but the problem is that it is an omnibus bill. It tries to do a great many things. Some of it is stuff that I would say the Conservatives have been leaders on. Others are things that, when I look at the legislation, I wonder where they came from or who was asking for them. While there is a lack of addressing bail issues and a lack of addressing sentencing issues, there are things in the bill about which I cannot imagine why the Liberals thought they were relevant for a bill that, by their own admission, is supposed to be about the border. I want to focus on two of those right now because I have a long track record of advocating for civil liberties. One of the provisions of the bill, part 4, would give Canada Post unilateral power to open not just parcels but also letters. This means that a letter one sends to anyone in the country could be intercepted, without a warrant or judicial oversight, by someone at Canada Post. Something we have heard in the course of debate this evening and this afternoon is some misinformation from the Liberal government. The Liberals say, “Oh, no, it would be subject to warrant.” Well, I have combed through the legislation, the entire bill, but also part 4 specifically, and in part 4, which deals with changes to the Canada Post Corporation Act, the word “warrant” does not appear once. In the act that this section of the bill cites, there is no discussion of warrants whatsoever. Therefore we are left, as Canadians, with the questions that the Liberal government is not answering: What are the constraints on this power? What would Canada Post be entitled to do or be authorized to do, not just with goods it may seize but also with information it may seize? The bill specifically talks about intercepting letters. That does not just mean opening an envelope and looking for fentanyl; that also means opening a piece of mail and being allowed to read it. Who would have access to correspondence? What could be done with it? Would it be tracked? Would it be registered? Would it be entered into a database? These are questions that we do not have answers for because the Liberals are denying that the text of the bill is what it is. Moreover, the bill would give Canada Post immunity. It would take away any liability for anything arising from demand, seizure, detention or retention, which means Canadians would have no rights to question or challenge what Canada Post is doing with their mail. To be clear, Canada Post has not asked for this power, that I have seen. This is something the Liberal government would voluntarily hand over without any regard for the civil liberties concerns. We can look at part 11 of the bill, which would ban cash transactions over $10,000. It would not put in a reporting requirement. It would not restrict it. It would not add bureaucracy or red tape. It is a clear ban. I will read directly from the bill: Every person or entity that is engaged in a business, a profession or the solicitation of charitable financial donations from the public commits an offence if the person or entity accepts a cash payment, donation or deposit of $10,000 or more in a single transaction or in a prescribed series of related transactions that total $10,000 or more. After 10 years of economic mismanagement, $10,000 is a regular haul at the grocery store. This $10,000 may seem like an amount, as the Liberals like to say, that no one is dealing in. They say no one is going around and dealing in $10,000 transactions unless they have something to hide. I represent a lot of rural and smaller communities in my riding, and it is not uncommon for someone to buy a used vehicle, buy a farm truck or buy a new piece of equipment for $10,000 or $15,000. Some may ask, as the Liberals do, why anyone would need to do that. We live in a free society where we do not need to justify our decision to engage in transactions with legal tender to the government. I am very aware of the fact that, as I speak, the Liberal government is actively fighting in court against a Federal Court decision that found its use of the Emergencies Act illegal in 2022. This is a government that unlawfully and unconstitutionally froze people's bank accounts without due process and without oversight. That sent a chill throughout the country as people realized that the government would use its power without regard for the law. I do not accept that the government is permitted to say to just trust it with putting a further restriction in place on how Canadians transact, and this is incredibly important. The Bank of Canada, which the Prime Minister used to run, has been advocating for central bank digital currency, something that would put the government more in control of and make it more able to monitor the transactions that Canadians choose to undertake. There are many reasons that people would use cash. In fact, in most cases that I am aware of, it has nothing to do with law breaking. It is simply because of convenience, avoiding staggering credit card fees and having the ability to transact and ensure that the local farmers' market or the person selling a vehicle in a riding, neighbourhood, whatever it is, can be free of government interference. While I am grateful the bill would deal with some issues at the border that we have long been calling for solutions for as Conservatives, it is taking a very broad brush and, in doing so, is treating ordinary law-abiding Canadians as though they are criminals, as though they have something to hide from the government or must be doing something wrong simply because they are using cash, as anyone who identifies as old school would do. What other legal things is the government planning to regulate or restrict? When we are looking at this bill, with how many different sections and different parts it has, we have to look at the good and we have to look at the bad. I think the government has tried to do too much in the course of this legislation. We have to look at the civil liberties concerns. Anytime they have been raised in the course of debating the bill, the Liberals have fallen back on either making a false claim, such as that a warrant is required under the Canada Post section, which it is not, or just relying on the notion that we are to trust them because there is no way the Liberal government would abuse this power. I do not trust them, and my constituents do not trust them either."
"I declare an interest as a Thames Water customer. The reality is that Thames Water is bankrupt. It cannot pay its debts and it cannot meet its legal obligations to Ofwat, the state and its customers. Therefore, surely the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery, and put it into special administration for PS1. The shareholders and the debt holders know--caveat emptor--that they have all blown their dough. If the Government buy it for PS1, which would be a good deal for the taxpayer, it will not have to pay huge, egregious rates of interest and taxpayers and customers will be the beneficiaries."
"I rise today because Republicans are making America safer and more prosperous, and, as part of that, we are strengthening Medicaid. You know, I am a doctor. I practiced medicine in Wyoming for over 20 years,and I cared for many, many Medicaid patients my entire career. I understand Medicaid's importance--importance for the people that it is intended to serve. I have also seen its shortcomings. Medicaid became a law in 1965. It was meant to be a safety net for the poor, for pregnant women, for children, and for the disabled. Today, Medicaid has been stretched way beyond its intended purposes. Today, Medicaid covers 71 million people. Many of these are able- bodied, working-age individuals. As a result, Medicaid has become broken and bloated. Its costs are ballooning. It is going to go bankrupt unless we take action now to strengthen it. The Republican plan will strengthen Medicaid for those for whom it was originally intended. Our bill ensures that illegal immigrants do not receive taxpayer- funded healthcare. It was never intended for that. But 14 liberal States currently give free taxpayer funded healthcare to illegal immigrants. California, of course, is the biggest offender because they set up a money-laundering scheme. The scheme is set up to siphon money from the Federal Treasury to provide free healthcare for illegal immigrants. The 1.4 million illegal immigrants who receive free healthcare, they strangle Medicaid in the funding. They are filling up waiting rooms and clinics. They are making it harder for Americans to get in to see a doctor. Our bill ends liberal States' magnet for illegal immigrants. Medicaid cannot continue to be a reward for open borders and sanctuary cities. Additionally, our bill roots out waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption in Medicaid. Experts tell us that, in recent years, Medicaid has wasted over $1 trillion in improper payments alone. In 2021, 660,000 people were enrolled in Medicaid in more than one State. How can that be? That is costing lots of money. The Wall Street Journal did a breakdown of this. They found that these double payments alone cost American taxpayers over $2 billion. Republicans will not allow scammers to continue to game the system and steal money from taxpayers. Additionally, our bill puts in place work requirements for these able-bodied, working-age adults. Twenty-one million able-bodied adults are currently on Medicaid. An American Enterprise Institute study recently found able-bodied adults on Medicaid who don't work. How do they spend their time? Well, they spend over 4 hours every day watching TV and playing video games. That is 125 hours a month. They ought to be working or at least looking for a job. Our bill requires these people to work or train 80 hours each month to remain on Medicaid. That is a lot less than the time they are currently spending watching TV and playing video games. Senate Republicans are proposing a responsible path to self-reliance for able-bodied, working-age people--no more taxpayer-funded coddling. Let me share with you a story about a man whose son relies on Medicaid. This man's son has autism and epilepsy. Medicaid was designed to serve individuals like this man's son. Yet, today, his son is stuck on a 10-year waiting list for in-home care. The man wrote about his family's needs. He wrote a whole article about it, entitled ``My Son Is Counting on Medicaid Work Requirements''--not for the son but for others, so they start working to make it easier for this man's son to get the benefits that he needs. Medicaid is often called a lifeline. Years of waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption have pushed those who truly need it to the back of the line. Republicans are fighting for families like this one. We are making sure Medicaid is there for the vulnerable. Meanwhile, Democrats are fine with healthy, working-age adults continuing to stay home, play video games, and receive Medicaid forever. Work requirements work. In the 1990s, Bill Clinton proposed that we end welfare as we know it. President Clinton partnered in a bipartisan way with the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, to pass bipartisan reform. Bipartisan welfare reform lifted millions out of poverty. Even President Obama admitted it. He said:  We have to have work as the centerpiece of any social policy.  President Obama was right then, and Republicans are right today. Today, every Democrat has vowed to oppose our commonsense reforms. Democrats' wasteful approach continues to drain Medicaid. Medicaid is for the truly needy. Medicaid is not for illegal immigrants or for able-bodied, working-age men who refuse to work. Republicans are rescuing this lifeline so that it serves those who need it the most now and into the future."
"In contrast to that, recent research by the Crown Estate Scotland has revealed that in one 12-month period, the Crown Estate helped its tenants to generate an economic impact of PS2.1 billion, and supported almost 17,000 jobs. A decade on from the devolution of the Crown Estate's assets and revenue, Scottish voters are enjoying the benefit. How can the Secretary of State continue to justify withholding the same profits from Wales, when in Scotland, those profits are being put back into the Scottish purse, where they belong?"
"May I, through the Secretary of State, pass on my best wishes to the Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, the hon. Member for West Lancashire  (Ashley Dalton)? In front of the Health and Social Care Committee in January, NHS England's then chief financial officer set out that pretty much all the additional funding to the NHS last year would be absorbed by pay rises, national insurance contributions and inflation. What proportion of the latest additional funding will be absorbed in the same way?"
"Unemployment is now 115,000 higher than when Labour took office. The Chancellor's new jobs tax and the Employment Rights Bill make hiring a new person more expensive. The family farms and family business taxes are reducing investment. Can the Minister therefore explain how he will reduce unemployment while the Chancellor is pursuing policies that increase it?"
"Order. Can I just say to both Front Benchers that Back Benchers also have to get in? Topical questions have to be short and punchy. Please, let us stick to the script. If the right hon. Member wants to ask longer questions, he should come in earlier--I could have picked the questions where he could have been brought in."
"I will say at the outset that I will not use my full five minutes. I will not take interventions, so hopefully more people can give their speeches, too. Buses are a vital route to connecting people with each other and with opportunity, which is why this Bill, which will improve bus services, is so important. In the Filton and Bradley Stoke constituency, our story is very mixed. For those who live near a route served by a Metrobus, a Y bus or a T1, it is usually pretty quick to get into Bristol city centre, but problems arise when trying to get across our towns and villages on the outskirts of the city, where many of our places of work and study are based, as are many of our loved ones. For many people, including those unable to drive, getting to Southmead hospital, which is just next door in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member  for Bristol North West (Darren Jones), is all but impossible using public transport, because, like our communities, it is outside the city centre. It is not uncommon for what should be a 10-minute drive to take around an hour on a bus, either because of the route or because one needs to change buses at the University of the West of England or Bristol Parkway. Often these stops are in the wrong direction and the travel times are simply not realistic, so people do not feel that they can leave their car at home, even when they want to. As a frequent bus user, I know how frustrating all this can be when, through no fault of our own, we are made late because of a ghost bus that did not show up, and we are left figuring out what to do at the side of the road. We have also had route changes, including to the No. Instead of taking people to the mall at Cribbs Causeway, where many people work and shop, the bus now stops partway there--and these are the parts of our community that have regular access to a bus. We now have the bizarre scenario in which residents in Winterbourne are finally being served by a bus, but only because buses are being redirected through the village while the motorway bridge is being rebuilt. I am glad that our new Labour West of England Mayor joined my long-standing calls, and those of the community, for a proper solution for people in Winterbourne. I am also incredibly glad that our new Labour Government are giving local leaders and communities the opportunity to take back control of local buses through this Bill, and I was proud to campaign for that ahead of the election. I encourage fellow residents to fill in my latest survey about their experiences of local buses. After years of Tory under-investment nationally and a real lack of understanding of how important buses are, vital routes have been lost, but I am optimistic that if other regions can do this--just look at Manchester, Liverpool, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, which are all at different points in their journeys but taking great strides forward--so can we. We must, because people in our community deserve the same opportunities as anyone else, anywhere else."
"Earlier this month, the US President ordered the brutal Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Los Angeles, and called those protesting against these raids ""paid insurrectionists"" and ""criminal invaders"". A few days later, a gunman assassinated Democratic politician Melissa Hortman. In recent months, figures associated with the  US President have spread disinformation and polarising rhetoric via social media, even targeting a Government Minister. I am sure that the Secretary of State agrees that this level of political violence--"
"It is a source of pride to see a Labour Chancellor announce such a transformative programme for social housing. My hope is that the boost to the affordable homes programme can be used to unlock stalled projects like those in Welwyn Garden City, in my constituency, where the Metropolitan Thames Valley development adjacent to the station needs to get motoring. I thank the Chancellor for her investment today. Does she agree that our message to councils and housing associations is, ""We back you--now it is time for you to build""?"
"My right hon. Friend makes a good point. This is about face-to-face relationships, not something done through an app. Behind the statistics I cited are real people and real communities. The digitally excluded, older people, those in poor health and people with lower financial resilience mostly rely on cash. Small businesses and rural communities are hard hit. The question for Members who want to compel banks to keep branches open is how much digital-first customers should be charged to retain loss-making branches--notwithstanding, of course, that profit question. Of course, the answer cannot simply be to do nothing and to walk away from our responsibilities to those who are left behind. The previous Government recognised the importance of maintaining essential banking services as a foundation for public confidence in this sector. Through the post office network, we provided a system of free and convenient access to banking services, and the banking framework partnership between the Post Office and over 30 of the UK's banks and building societies means consumers and businesses can access basic banking services through the post office network. The Post Office now has more branches than all the banks and building societies combined, and according to the Financial Conduct Authority, post office branches make up more than 66% of all branch-based cash access points in the UK. The last Government also introduced banking hubs, which we have heard a great deal about. I am conscious of time, and I do not want to incur your wrath, Madam Deputy Speaker, so although I have a lot more to say, I think it would be prudent for me to step aside and allow the Minister to face up to the passion about this issue from Members representing their communities."
"Asked whether the Government were planning to restrict EHCPs so that they apply only to children in special schools, the Government's strategic adviser on SEND, Christine Lenehan, recently said: ""I think, to be honest, that's the conversation we're in the middle of."" Is she correct to say that Ministers are considering that, or not?"
"Mr. Speaker, like the member, I served in the army cadets. Those were some of the best years of my life. I learned about discipline. I learned about respect. I learned about service, in a way. I was very young, and it taught me a lot. I want to thank all members of the armed forces for their commitment and dedication. They always put the country first. The member is right. Yesterday was a great day for Canada because we invested in our sovereignty. We invested in our industry. We invested in our workers. We know that our investments in defence are going to support our industrial base. I was in the media saying that every company in this country should have a defence strategy. If companies are selling a service, product or solution, they should look to see whether their product, solution or service can help build Canada strong. This is a moment that reminds me of C. D. Howe in 1945. Mr. Speaker, you are too young to remember C. D. Howe in 1945, but you may have read about him. C. D. Howe was the great architect of a new industrial base in Canada, and I see a parallel between 1945 and 2025. This is the time to build. We are the true north strong and free."
"I rise today to mark Building Safety Month 2025 and to recognize the more than 60,000 members of the International Code Council (ICC) who have dedicated their livelihoods to ensuring public safety throughout the built environment.  Building Safety Month is sponsored by the International Code Council and its partners to remind the public of the professionals who ensure buildings are safe, resilient, affordable, efficient, and livable. The Code Council brings together local, state, and federal government stakeholders, as well as those from the private sector to develop model codes and standards that protect the occupants of the buildings in which we live, work, and play. Those standards are then implemented year-round by building safety officials, the fire services, architects, engineers, builders, and other skilled tradespeople to ensure the safe construction and maintenance of buildings. Building Safety Month is an annual celebration to remind the public of the critical role of local code officials--who ensure the safe, sustainable, and affordable buildings essential to prosperity. In late 2020, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) released its ``Building Codes Saves'' report, which found that implementing modern building codes could prevent $600 billion in disaster-related spending by 2060. FEMA further confirmed a prior report by the National Institute of Building Sciences that found that adopting modern codes provides $11 dollars in mitigation savings for every $1 dollar invested. As the Ranking Member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee--responsible for oversight and authorization of FEMA--I have heard repeated testimony from expert witnesses on the increase in both the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Building codes and standards are critical to protecting the public from these disasters, including wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, snow and ice storms, and earthquakes. As Americans rebuild after disasters, we recognize and thank those who implement and enforce building codes for protecting lives, property, and businesses, and ultimately ensuring our communities are resilient to future events. Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking International Code Council Board President David Spencer--a fellow Washingtonian--as well as ICC's Chief Executive Officer John Belcik, the International Code Council leadership, and ICC's Members and staff as they recognize Building Safety Month 2025."
"The shadow Minister will know from our time in Committee that I am an ex-police officer, and I thank him for his words about police officers serving the country. Does he agree that the Bill will give the police more confidence that they will have the right powers, so that they are able to make a difference?"
"Mr. Chair, what I can tell the member is that our debt ratio is 10.1%, and our total budget is—"
I call the Chair of the Standards Committee.
"Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question, and I absolute appreciate the challenge he has just identified. One of my friends for the last couple of decades is also a physician, Andrew Furey, and he was the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador until recently. He worked with Atlantic premiers because, as my colleague has correctly identified, the actual certification of physicians and other health care professionals is properly within the provincial domain. Atlantic Canada got together and created an Atlantic physicians registry, led by the four provinces, which we think is an example to the rest of the country. The Government of Canada wants to encourage exactly that kind of work."
"Mr. Speaker, what we have heard the member say in responding to questions is that she did not have a number, but then did have a number, but did not, and that it might be 100,000, which is small, but that it might also be 20,000 or maybe a dozen. The point here is that the Liberals are essentially, with this bill, enabling endless chain migration with no consecutive residency requirement, which actually devalues Canadian citizenship. The PBO said it would be over 100,000 people in five years. Why has the bill been presented in this way?"
"Mr. Chair, the housing temporary relief that we have is long-term. We provided money to provinces in order to build infrastructure that is permanent. The number—"
"Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my neighbours in Burlington North—Milton West for their confidence, but I would also like to sincerely thank the good people of Carleton for electing a fantastic community champion as their member of Parliament. The community sport for all initiative lifts people up by breaking down barriers to physical activity, with programs such as Dribble Dreams in Milton and Ottawa South United Soccer in the member's riding, an organization the MP knows well because he is so connected to his community. Partners such as KidSport and Jumpstart have already helped more than one million Canadian families and kids to enjoy sport and participate. That is because every kid deserves a chance to play, to compete and to belong. When kids play, Canada wins."
"Following discussion among representatives of all parties in the House, I understand that there is an agreement to observe a moment of silence and pay tribute in honour of our former colleague, the Hon. Marc Garneau. I invite hon. members to rise. [ A moment of silence observed ]"
"Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand."
"Let us be short and frank, then. For many of us in this House, this is no longer complicated. Time has run out for claiming ambiguity of action. Since 20 May, we have seen 22 more settlements. It is deliberately made dangerous for people to access aid, and the Israel Defence Forces have declared the roads to the aid distribution centres ""combat zones"". The Minister says that the Government have raised concerns and have called for immediate independent investigations, but those have not happened--not just in this incident, but repeatedly. He will not tell us what he will do. This is on the consciences of us all, so we have to ask him to be clearer. Will he tell us what is not on the table? Will he rule out things? He has told us that he is talking about the future, but will he rule out immediate recognition of Palestine, which many of us have been calling for, the sanctions that many of us have been calling for, and a final resolution of the F-35 farce? If he does, at least we will get sense of where this is going."
"Mr. Chair, that was actually not my question. I asked the President of the Treasury Board to tell us what the projected deficit will be this year."
"Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand."
"I am pleased to wind up this debate on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Southampton Itchen (Darren Paffey) for securing it. As others have said, this debate is incredibly timely, as this week is National Drowning Prevention Week. There have been a number of excellent contributions today. I was very pleased to hear the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Monica Harding), and want to associate myself with the points she and other hon. Members made on the importance of being prepared to spot the dangers and react to them and to be ready when things go wrong, which is just as important as being able to swim in the first place. Other hon. Members have raised important points and details--even in short interventions--and I am particularly pleased to see so many colleagues from across the House who have attended recent debates on rural and coastal communities in their places. There is clearly a theme building here. The hon. Member for Southampton Itchen spoke about calls for ministerial responsibility. I think that could fit very well within the portfolio of a Minister for coastal communities, and I look forward to exploring that possibility with him further. Members who have paid close attention to my past speeches in this House might have noticed that North Norfolk is a proud coastal community. By our nature, we have a lot of water, and our beaches and seas are beloved by residents and tourists alike, although for those who are not confident in the water, they can also be incredibly dangerous. Norfolk's inland waterways are also very special, with the Norfolk broads and fantastic rivers and chalk streams like the Glaven, Bure and Stiffkey. This is a serious concern not just to me, but to Imogen, who attends a primary school in my constituency, and who wrote to me with her concerns. Imogen said: ""All around North Norfolk there are lots of rivers which are wonderful. Apart from that if people don't know how to swim they may fall in and drown. This is a tragic problem which affects people all around England. If people were on a walk around a river or lake and accidentally slip in and inhale the water their families would be distraught. I am not asking for a law that people know how to swim, but am requesting your attention so that you can review the problem if it persists. It may be a good idea to think about how this affects England as a whole."" She closes by saying: ""I know there are lifesaving rings dotted around but feel there is not enough and that a few more lives could be saved if there are more that can be used. Swimming lessons are charged quite high making it harder for people to be able to teach their children to swim which may be part of the problem."" I am sure hon. Members will agree that Imogen, despite being in primary school, has summarised this problem and highlighted the issues just as well as any of us could have. Water safety is an issue that could affect any one of our constituents, potentially when they least expect it, as Imogen points out. I agree with her that we need to take a serious look at this across the House, and I hope that the Government will be able to provide not just reassurance and answers, but a promise of action to Imogen and everyone else who is concerned about this issue. The Liberal Democrats are committed to mandatory swimming lessons in schools and are calling on the Government to ensure that identified swimming skills gaps are urgently addressed. The fact that 30% of 11 to 12-year-olds are unable to swim more than 25 metres is  a real worry for those of us in rural and coastal communities who worry for the safety of our young people in our rivers and seas. To address those issues, we have to invest more in our local swimming pools. I am delighted that in North Norfolk, in the past few years, we have built the Reef leisure centre swimming pool in Sheringham--a real state-of-the-art facility, which is a great asset to the community. I am equally delighted that the Lib Dem council has secured funding for a multimillion-pound expansion and refurbishment of Fakenham leisure centre, which will include a new 25-metre swimming pool, in the constituency of my neighbour, the hon. Member for Broadland and Fakenham (Jerome Mayhew)."
"Mr. Chair, can the minister tell us which cities those 1,000 RCMP officers will be delegated to?"
"I welcome the Liberal Democrats' support for the commitment we have made at NATO; the Leader of the Opposition was unable to offer that support at Prime Minister's questions last week. If the hon. Gentleman has ideas about how we should fund that commitment in the next Parliament, I would be perfectly happy to hear them."
"I thank my hon. Friend deeply for securing this debate. The issue came up in the first visit that I made in my constituency, to Walton Hall academy, which is on a 60 mph stretch of road. Parents find it extremely stressful taking their children with special educational needs and disabilities to and from school. The young people there are campaigning to get the speed limit changed, but they are hitting brick walls with the difficulty in getting highways authorities to listen. Does my hon. Friend agree that community schools and young people should be supported by highways authorities and listened to on such matters?"
"I said it would be in this Session of Parliament, not this Parliament."
"Mr. Chair, what the Prime Minister has said is that he wants to build projects of national importance."
"With reference to recommendation 46, the US's 2025 marine aviation plan, published earlier this year, outlined that the US Marine Corps--by far the biggest user of the F-35B--has changed its programme of record, reducing orders for F-35Bs by 73 aircraft in favour of the F-35C. The upshot is that the unit price of each B aircraft is about to increase by tens of millions, and we have not yet committed to a second tranche. What assessment has been made of the current queue for the F-35A, despite the decline in its fully mission-capable rate with the US air force, and--following on from my many written questions--what assessment has been made of converting our remaining B orders to F-35C and modifying our carriers to CATOBAR, which would also extend their range and therefore increase their survivability in a near-peer conflict?"
The hon. member for Abitibi—Témiscamingue.
"earlier today, we received reports that Iran has targeted U.S. military bases and U.S. servicemembers in the Middle East, putting the lives of thousands of Americans at immediate risk. I join Americans in praying for their safety. This afternoon, I asked the Trump administration to immediately provide a classified briefing, laying out the full threat picture, the intelligence behind Iran's retaliation, and the detailed scope and timeline of any U.S. response. More importantly, I demanded they lay out exactly what measures they are taking right now to keep our servicemembers safe. As I said Saturday night, Congress and the American people are owed answers. No President should be allowedto unilaterally march this Nation into war with erratic threats, no strategy, and no explanation. That is why I have called on Leader Thune to hold a vote immediately to enforce the War Powers Resolution. The law requires the Trump administration to consult with Congress; the Constitution demands it; and the American people, especially the families of those in harm's way, deserve nothing less. Confronting the Iranian regime's nuclear ambitions--and stopping their campaign of terror--demands strength, resolve, and strategic clarity."
"I so appreciate the comments of my colleague from Nevada. So many of us are so frustrated with the failure of this legislature to address this fundamental injustice to our Dreamers. Certainly immigration has been a part of the American spirit for a very long time. In 1752, three Merkle brothers--a name that was later converted to Merkley--arrived from Germany to be the first three of four settlers of the town of New Durlach. More than a century later, we had those powerful words written by Emma Lazarus carved into the base of the Statue of liberty:  Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!  Generations of immigrant families that were brought in through the Statue of Liberty island immigration center read those words as they arrived and were inspired as they began their American dream. But those who didn't come through that immigration center were also inspired by that vision of people coming from around the world to build this land, this land in which we have government of, by, and for the people.  Among those who have been inspired are those who arrived in more recent times. And our Dreamers, those who were less than 16, arriving before 2007, they were being given the chance, through the decision of President Obama, to grant them status in 2012 to have their American dream. And their success as a group shows it was the right policy and that it is long past time for Congress to pass a Dream Act to give them a path to citizenship. Our good colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, has been fighting for these young people for passage of the Dream Act time and time again. And it is the Senate's 40-vote veto that has stopped us from ever having a vote on that policy, a final vote on that policy. You know, the Dream Act didn't simply come from one side of the aisle. It was Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican, who first introduced it in 2001. But the bill for the Dreamers has languished in Congress year after year after year. In 2012, President Obama, therefore, took action and announced a deferred action for childhood arrivals, the DACA policy, to protect those children who were brought here as youth, knew, often, no other country, often spoke no other language. This is their home.  And he noted at the time that this was to be ``a temporary stopgap measure'' for Congress to be able to debate and vote on a permanent legislation, the Dream Act. But Congress hasn't voted--that is, the Senate has never voted on final passage--despite decades, despite bipartisan support. And even now, in December, President Trump said on ``Meet the Press''--so we are talking just months ago, after he won reelection: ``We have to do something about the Dreamers.'' So let's do something here as we note the 13th anniversary of DACA. More than 825,000 young men and women--approximately 8,000 in my home State of Oregon--are caught in legal limbo yet ``yearning to breathe free.'' Won't they be able to breathe a lot freer if we were able to resolve their legal status? In 2022, the Department of Homeland Security codified DACA. But due to litigation, more than 100,000 applications are still pending from people seeking DACA protections. The Trump administration has been quite aggressive about deporting undocumented immigrants. And it could, in fact, rescind DACA's protections. So let's act. Let's resolve this situation. Here is what we understand. In 2012, President Obama described recipients as ``young people who study in our schools, who play in our neighborhoods, who are friends with our children, who pledge allegiance to the flag.'' But while Congress waited to act all these years, those young people have grown up. DACA's protections allowed them to graduate from school, to apply for jobs, to become pillars in our communities. Over the last 13 years, they contributed more than $140 billion to the U.S. economy and more than $40 billion in Federal payroll, State, and local taxes. They enrich our country in so many ways, serving as teachers, as nurses, as police officers, in addition to being our colleagues, our neighbors, and our friends. We are a nation of immigrants. Unless you are part of the Tribal communities that have been on this land from time immemorial, unless you just arrived as a new immigrant, you are descended from immigrants, immigrants who arrived here often with welcoming arms, as mentioned in Emma Lazarus's poem engraved in the foundation of the Statue of Liberty. We should not be slamming that door shut on the Dreamers who were brought here as children, who already contributed so much to our country. Let's not just give speeches about the 13th anniversary, let's get those 100,000 pending DACA applications processed. Let's get the Dream Act to the floor to give DACA recipients a legal path to citizenship, and let's finish the work that Senator Durbin and so many others have been carrying forward for so many years to ensure that the American dream is open to all."
"Mr. Chair, we look forward to working toward enhancing bail."
"Mr. Speaker, the Green Party agrees to apply the vote, voting no."
"I rise today to recognize Major General Melissa Coburn for her service to the 22nd Air Force at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia. Major General Coburn commissioned through the United States Air Force Academy in 1992 and served eleven years on active duty, before transitioning to the Air Force Reserve in February 2003. During her service, Major General Coburn has more than 6,000 flight hours in the T-37, T-38, C-141B, C-123, KC-135, C-17A, C-40, C-130H/J, including 279 combat hours in support of operations in Hungary, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Major General Coburn has been a close partner in improving our Nation's tactical air mobility operations capability through recapitalization of the Air Force Reserve's C-130 inventory. She has heavily invested in servicemember quality of life improvements throughout her command, especially at Dobbins Air Reserve Base. With more than 12,000 Reserve Airmen and 59 unit-equipped aircraft, her leadership of the 22nd Air Force has directly contributed to our Nation's security through aerial spray, fire suppression, weather reconnaissance, tactical airlift and airdrop and aeromedical evacuation. As Major General Coburn continues her service to the United States upon her departure from Dobbins Air Reserve Base and the 22nd Air Force, it has been a pleasure working closely with her to benefit our servicemembers. I congratulate Major General Coburn on her Change of Command and look forward to working with her again soon in the years to come."
"Mr. Speaker, how many square kilometres does that equate to?"
"Mr. Speaker, a tax cut for 22 million Canadians on July 1: check. GST off homes for first-time homebuyers: check. The government being fully funded and the supply bills being passed and off to the Senate: check. Defence spending at 2% of GDP: check. Today, and I invite the hon. member to join us, the bill to build Canada strong, the bill to build jobs in this country and create opportunity right across this land: check."
"Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise in this place on behalf of the great people of not just southwest Saskatchewan but also west central Saskatchewan. With the redistribution of the ridings for the past federal election, I have taken on some significant area to the north of what the old riding used to be. It is an honour to be able to represent people from that new area. I want to thank my constituents for trusting me to be their representative here in the House for a third time. While I was on the campaign trail, I was door knocking in the town of Biggar. “New York is big, but this is Biggar"" is a saying in that town. It is a great community. I knocked on this one door, and a mom answered. She was a single mom with a couple of young kids, and she was working as an EA in the local school there. As the conversation went on, she talked about how unaffordable life has become, about the struggles of a single mom and the plight she was in with her former partner not doing a good job of making his spousal and child support payments, as well as the lack of enforcement around that. The reason that matters is that while we have this story about this young lady in Biggar and the struggles she is going through in life, on the other hand, we need to look at what has been happening with the government, which is the same as the last government and not the new government it says it is. Look at the track record of so many ministers. We can look at the scandals, the waste and what has gone on over the last 10 years. What happened with GC Strategies is just another glaring example of the type of cronyism, the type of fraud, that has really been committed against the taxpayer. This young mom, in the situation she is in, sees this and wonders, “What on earth is going on? I can't even get ahead.” In the Auditor General report here, it says that not only did Kristian Firth get all this money that he should not have been getting; he also got to help write some of the contracts. He got to help write some of the conditions for the deals. There was a $25-million deal that he helped write, and then he got the deal, and of course it was heavily slanted in favour of GC Strategies. What a shocker. We see that, and then we hear about the plight of this young lady. I know that all of us on the campaign trail would have heard similar stories from people who are struggling with the cost of living, people who are struggling after 10 years of bad Liberal policy, and what that has done to them and their communities and their ability to afford housing, to afford groceries, to afford a vehicle, to get out of high school, to get out of college, to get out of university and enter the workforce, and how those opportunities are not there, thanks to Liberal mismanagement of basically everything. After the last campaign, those are the kinds of stories that people elected us here to be able to tell. The Auditor General's report and the issues it talks about are the reason why we have a motion today calling on the government to make sure that GC Strategies repays the money, that that money is recovered. I just want to highlight a couple of other things from the Auditor General's report. Right at the very beginning, it reads: Federal organizations are required to monitor the work performed by contractors. However, we noted that federal organizations frequently disregarded government policies in this area. This included not having records showing which contracted resources performed the work, what work was completed, and whether the people doing the work had the required experience and qualifications. In addition, in 82% of examined non‑competitive contracts and competitive contracts that received only 1 valid bid, federal organizations failed to verify that the fees paid did not exceed market rates. On top of that, let us take a look at some of the notes in the report as well. Underneath the rubric of “Federal organizations did not follow procurement policies when awarding contracts”, it reads, “Procurement methods were not consistently justified”, “Security requirements were not enforced”, “There were weaknesses in contract monitoring”, “Information on suppliers' performance and rates was not collected and shared”, “Support for contract prices frequently lacked justification” and “Federal organizations made payments without evidence showing that all deliverables were received”. Most people at home are probably wondering what on earth GC Strategies did. Well, it did basically nothing, except to take a lot of money for the ArriveCAN app. For a lot of people, if we tell them about the ArriveCAN app, it instantly triggers a reaction. It brings them back to a time of government overreach: people being forced into quarantine who should not have been, people not being allowed to leave or enter Canada and all kinds of issues like that. That is what people remember about ArriveCAN. GC Strategies is the company that was awarded a big contract. It was supposed to only cost about $80,000 for this app but ended up costing over $64 million. We do not even know the total cost of it, because the Auditor General could not get access to all of the information on it. That is what we are dealing with here today with our opposition day motion. We are demanding that the government get that money back. I also want to bring people back to when we called Kristian Firth to the bar here. He was admonished by this House. However, there was a very telling element to that. One of the last questions that was asked of Mr. Firth before he was done was whether he felt any shame. His answer was that he did not. Then he just hopped up and walked out, and that was the end of it. He felt no shame. He took all this money, robbed the taxpayer and away he went. I read out some of the things in the Auditor General report: the support for contract pricing, the lack of justification, that federal organizations had made payments without showing deliverables, the weaknesses in contract monitoring and the security requirements not being enforced. Why does that matter? There are a lot of reasons why that matters, but what it goes to is government responsibility. Are ministers following up with their departments? Do they even know what their departments are doing? What this shows is a complete lack of leadership in the government among its ministers. What happened to those ministers? Most of them were re-elected and put back into cabinet. In a lot of cases, they were promoted to even higher portfolios, with more responsibility. They failed upwards. That is what was given to them by the Prime Minister . One would have thought that after Justin Trudeau stepped down as prime minister, and the supposed new government came in with a new leader, there would be some changes in the front bench of the Liberal government over there. There have not been. They are the people who are ultimately responsible for this, because the buck stops with the ministers. The ministers need to know what is happening in their file and their department. There is no ministerial responsibility left, thanks to 10 years of the Liberal government. GC Strategies is just one of many examples of why people are so sick and tired of the government corruption coming from there. I want to take us back to 2019, when I was first elected. One of the first subjects I stood up in this House to speak on was the Joe Peschisolido report; he was another former Liberal who was in breach of ethics. We also had the SNC-Lavalin scandal. We are all pretty familiar with what happened under that situation. Then we had the green slush fund, which seized this place up for a number of months prior to the election, talking about Liberal scandal again, and so many other scandals woven in between all of that. We have new members from the government standing up to give their first speeches today. What are they giving their first speeches on? They are speaking on our motion on Liberal government scandal. It must be a little demoralizing over there, knowing they have to get up and talk about the scandals, the waste, the corruption and the fraud that has gone on and has permeated throughout the government for 10 years. That is what their first speech will be about. As an opposition member, when I was first elected in 2019, to me it was no wonder we were talking about Liberal corruption and scandal. It was no shock, watching how Justin Trudeau ran this country. Therefore, when we look at the motion here today, it would seem that the very least the government could do is demand that the money that was stolen from Canadian taxpayers by GC Strategies, under false pretenses, be recouped and repaid. I hope the government takes it seriously. We have been hearing Liberals say, “Oh, we're going to take them to court,"" but then, ""Well, maybe we're not taking it to court.” We do not know what is actually going to happen there. The government needs to take this seriously. I hope this motion passes and that we see the taxpayers made whole, not just for the amount but maybe even for the interest that has accrued. Canadian taxpayers need to be made whole. I hope the government takes that seriously."

"Mr. Speaker, last time I checked, I think we were elected on a bold agenda of change: to cut taxes, to fight against illegal tariffs, to bring this country together and build one strong economy. The rhetoric I hear across the way is the same old politics that former member Pierre Poilievre and the Conservatives peddled for two decades. In the ballot box, just as in business, if people do not deliver after two decades, they lose their job. He lost his job. We have our jobs. We are elected. We are here to build the strongest, most resilient—"
"The reason we are protecting existing claimants and beginning to focus PIP on those with higher needs in future is because we want a system that is sustainable and lasts. I do not believe it is sustainable to have a doubling of the number of PIP claims every decade, adding 1,000 people a day. The rate is rising faster than the increase in prevalence of disabled people in this country. The truth is that the parts of the country that have the highest disability benefit claims and incapacity benefit claims are the places that were decimated by the Tories in the '80s and '90s, when whole industries closed. Those places are yet to have the investment they need to create jobs and have not had the investment in the NHS. I have always believed in the social model of disability. We have to put these things right urgently, because disabled people deserve a better life than they had under the Conservatives."
"Mr. Chair, the department has funded, through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, hundreds of thousands of homes in these recent years. The scale is significant, and it needs to double from here."
"Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to rise today to speak in support of Bill C-2 . Recognizing the amount of time that I have, I will make my comments somewhat brief. I do want to begin by saying that, throughout the last campaign, and since 2021, I have had the privilege of meeting thousands of my constituents. Over and over, I have heard one message. They want a forward-looking and ambitious government that delivers for them. They want that government to fight organized crime. They want that government to fight auto theft, and they want that government to tackle the fentanyl crisis. Members of Parliament on both sides of the House will have heard, I suspect, from their constituents, that Canadians want to feel safe in their homes, they want to feel safe in their communities, and they want our government to ensure that we deliver that for them. This bill would do exactly that. It would deliver on bold and concrete actions. It would tackle the complex interconnected threats that Canadians are facing today. Whether it is fentanyl, auto theft, or money laundering, Bill C-2 seeks to deal with all of those issues. It does so by delivering on three important measures: securing our borders, dismantling transnational organized crime and cracking down on illicit financing. Securing our borders means fixing long-standing gaps in our immigration system, modernizing how we share information, strengthening visa protections to stop fraud, and improving the asylum application process to make it more efficient and fair. These reforms would preserve the integrity of our system while ensuring that those who actually need protection continue to receive it. We can only have a strong and resilient country if our security agencies are empowered to protect Canadians while preserving their freedoms. Thanks to this bill, once passed, the RCMP and our international partners would be able to better track and apprehend child sex offenders. That is why, if this bill is passed, the Canadian Coast Guard would have a clear mandate to counter drug smuggling and enhance maritime protection and enforcement, something that has been long needed in provinces such as mine and British Columbia. This is an opportunity for Conservatives to put their money where their mouths are. They talk about law and order. They talk about keeping Canadians safe. This is their chance to vote with us, to ensure that this bill gets passed. This bill also directly addresses the devastating rise in organized crime and the fentanyl crisis. We intend to empower our law enforcement agencies who are at the forefront of this fight, with the ability to seize illegal drugs, such as fentanyl and its components. We are also making it easier and faster to classify illicit substances before they take root in our communities. These changes would not only stop the flow of illicit and dangerous substances into Canada, but also make it harder for criminal networks to produce and distribute them domestically. Now, we know that supporting and protecting Canadians requires additional support mechanisms across Canada. That is why we will keep traffickers, smugglers and violent criminals accountable for their crimes by giving the authorities the legal tools that they need to act decisively. On the point of auto theft, we know that auto theft has decreased, thanks to the work that the new government has already taken, but we also know that Canadians want us to do more. With this bill, border officials would have the authority to intercept those shipments, recover stolen property and hold those responsible accountable. For too long, money laundering and terrorist financing have allowed organized crime to profit and expand, but this bill would put forward stronger penalties for financial crimes, restrict anonymous large-cash deposits and prohibit third-party transactions that allow bad actors to hide behind others. Finally, Bill C-2 builds upon the single largest investment in border security in Canadian history, $1.3 billion, and reflects a clear and targeted approach to the challenges that we are facing. It reflects our government's commitment to responsible, balanced governance to tackle everyday issues that Canadians are facing. These are not small changes. Let me be clear. This bill is about fixing systems, closing loopholes and ensuring Canada keeps pace with a rapidly evolving global landscape of crime, exploitation of systems and digital threats. Our allies are watching and Canadians are calling on us to protect them. Canadians have told us what they need. They want us to balance freedom and security. They want a government that takes safety seriously, confronts difficult problems, and delivers results, while protecting our fundamental rights and freedoms. I urge my colleagues in the House to join us in passing this bill, putting aside partisanship and putting the security and safety of Canadians first."
"Madam Speaker, Conservatives would want to see the Liberals absolutely do more and have shovel-ready projects. It is really unfortunate that we had a promise that there would be an elimination of these interprovincial trade barriers by Canada Day, yet here we are still debating this issue. We would like to see this done at a much faster pace, and we would like to see greater steps. Yes, we need to move beyond this rhetoric and actually get this thing done."
"I think that the vast majority of people in this country believe in a welfare system that is compassionate to the vulnerable, and particularly to the disabled, but they can no longer understand why so many people here--in contrast to other similar countries--are in this situation where they are not working."
"Madam Speaker, I thank the member for the question. In my past life, I advised the Six Nations of the Grand River Development Corporation on infrastructure and sustainable finance investments it made. I can tell the member that the resiliency of indigenous Canadians is one to be marvelled at. On this side of the House, we have a strong commitment to partnering with indigenous communities—"
"The right hon. and learned Gentleman is right to say that the document is distinguished by a broader view of national security, which is also reflected in the discussion at NATO today, where we are looking beyond our core defence expenditure on our armed forces to the other things we have discussed that contribute to our national security. I thank the Intelligence and Security Committee for its work in all its iterations over the years. I have a good dialogue with the Committee. I look forward to that continuing, and to the Committee playing its very important role."
I move to proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 93.
"Mr. Speaker, every step of the way, we have worked to make sure that Canadians' costs go down and Canadians have more powerful paycheques, something the Conservatives have said time and again, and they have actually voted against it. Whether it is things like reducing the cost of child care, ensuring school food programs or increasing the Canada child benefit, which, by the way, is pegged to inflation so that families have what they need as they are raising their children, the Conservatives have voted against it. They should put their money where their mouth is and support a comprehensive policy that supports families."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have in my hands a document entitled “Canada’s Electric Vehicle Availability Standard”, with a timeline where it says that the requirements increase to—"
"Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear. Our caucus supports the version of the bill that was introduced by Senator Yonah Martin. It deals with measures to be taken in legitimate cases where citizenship should be restored. That said, Bill C‑3 goes further than what Canadians and the courts are calling for. I cannot support the measures in this bill that I spoke of earlier."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. This legislation simply puts our national security at risk by forcing DHS to hand over parts of its playbook on how it stops potential actors from entering the United States. It is all going to make us less safe. This bill would require Customs and Border Protection to publish sensitive national security information on a monthly real-time basis. We are not talking about personal identifiable information, despite the author's claim. We are talking about releasing who CBP is looking for, targeting, and where those advance interviews are actually happening in real time. This essentially gives the bad people the opportunity to coordinate, triangulate, and take advantage of the situation, essentially to know what our playbook is. We all support transparency and accountability at DHS--that is our job here in Congress--but not at the expense of tipping off terrorists or criminal organizations as to what our playbook is. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security."
"I rise to congratulate the Louisiana State University baseball team for taking home their eighth national title. Under the leadership of Coach Jay Johnson, LSU captured their second title in 3 years. The Tigers triumphed through their championship season with 53 wins and an undefeated College World Series. Coach Johnson and his team exemplified excellence on and off the field, making Louisiana proud of not only their athleticism but also their outstanding character and service to the Baton Rouge community. As LSU's Representative in Congress, I joined my constituents in following the team's journey to yet another championship. ESPN this week referred to LSU as the ``Greatest Ever College Baseball Program,'' and I couldn't agree more. This victory wasn't just about raising the trophy at the end. It was a testament to the resilient, winning spirit of our State. I thank the players, coaches, and staff for inspiring a new generation of Tigers to dream big and for representing Louisiana with honor on the national stage. Congratulations. Geaux Tigers."
"The Prime Minister knows this has nothing to do with national security; it is his bad negotiating. I have had the security briefings; it was a bad deal before, and it is still a bad deal. In half an hour, the Chancellor is going to stand up and tell us that everything is fine, but the truth is that she has made bad choices--bad choices that mean higher inflation, bad choices that have led to lower growth, and bad choices that have meant that jobs have been lost every single month since Labour came into office. That is hundreds of thousands of families who have lost their income in Stoke, Grangemouth and Luton. Those are their constituencies and businesses across the country. The Chancellor has lost all her headroom. She has fallen out with the Cabinet. She is making unfunded spending commitments, which she promised not to do. Is the truth not that we have got the wrong Chancellor and the wrong priorities?"
"Given that the right hon. Member was a member of the previous Government, her question might be rather more plausible if she apologised for the 100-fold increase in small boat crossings under her Government's watch and for the quadrupling of net migration as a result of the policies that she supported in government. If she wants to support stronger action against illegal migration and the gangs that are organising it, why will she not support the counter-terrorism powers that this Government are putting in place to go after them?"
I call the shadow Minister.
"Yesterday, as the Minister probably knows, food bank groups associated with the Trussell Trust lobbied--very effectively --Members on both sides of the House. My local group, the Waterside food bank, impressed on me the gap between the PS92, which the Government believe a single person is estimated to need to survive, and the PS120 that the food bank believes is necessary for a single person to be able to survive alone. Can the Minister give an indication as to what extent the gap between those two figures will be closed as a result of this initiative?"
"When it comes to the evils of terrorism and aggression across the middle east, all paths lead back to the Iranian regime--be that the sponsorship of Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis or, indeed, at the heart of the regime, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Although I fully appreciate that the Prime Minister will not speculate on proscription from the Dispatch Box, will he at least reflect on how it can be that, despite calls from both sides of the House over many years to proscribe the IRGC, it still has not happened, not least given that he took the right and proper action to proscribe Palestine Action after the attack on Brize Norton last week? How is it that the IRGC still sits un-proscribed?"
The hon. member for Simcoe North.
"Mr. Speaker, as July 1 approaches, Quebeckers who are still looking for a place to live are becoming increasingly concerned. Why? Housing is too expensive. Meanwhile, the Minister of Housing and Infrastructure sees no need for prices to come down. He, of course, is a wealthy property owner, so perhaps it is in his interest to keep housing costs high. His refusal to answer the question is stirring up mistrust. Why is the Prime Minister letting a real estate millionaire decide the future of struggling Quebec tenants?"
"The powers to which the hon. Gentleman refers, and which his amendment seeks to remove-- I will come on to speak about it in more detail--were set out in the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act. Does the hon. Gentleman realise that he voted for that Act? He voted for these powers."
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Kings—Hants for his speech and his sensitivity on issues affecting indigenous peoples. He repeated the phrase we have often heard from the Liberals over the past few days, about creating one Canadian economy out of 13. This shows how little consideration was given to the indigenous economy, even in the thought process that led to this election commitment to encroach on provincial jurisdictions. Otherwise, they might have said 14 economies, or maybe even 70. Every nation has its own economic values. Every nation's economic values are different. When I hear them talking about 13 economies, I assume they are referring to the economies of the 10 provinces and three territories. Has my colleague considered that indigenous people can have their own economy, separate from those of the provinces?"
"Madam Speaker, I absolutely do. I have to repeat that there is a beautiful, brand new plant in my riding in the city of Welland, where I live. It is a 300,000-square-foot facility. The only reason it was built was because of the subsidies given to it. The plant is never opening. It is on the market for rent or for sale. This is an incredible example of what happens when the government interferes with the private sector. Consumers will drive the market. We will make a transition to electric vehicles, but we cannot force it by saying that, in the next 10 years, thou shalt not produce another gas-powered vehicle in this country. It is not going to work. This is going to be the new carbon tax, and I guarantee that the government is going to back down on this in a few years."
"I rise to speak in favour of new clause 15, which clarifies that an assisted death would not be classified as an unnatural death and that a full coroner's inquest would not normally be required. My constituent Antony Shackleton lived with motor neurone disease for six long years. As his condition worsened, his options narrowed until there was only one choice that preserved his dignity, autonomy and peace: to travel to Dignitas in Switzerland and end his suffering on his own terms. Louise, as his wife of 25 years, and someone who had known him since the age of 18, did what any loving partner would do: she stood by him. She helped him on to that plane and held his hand through the most difficult decision of their lives, and now, for that act of love, she is under police investigation. That is precisely why we need new clause 15. If the Bill is passed, assisted dying would be a legal, strictly regulated and monitored choice made by the individual concerned."
"Mr. Chair, the development of critical minerals will be crucial to the Canadian economy. The entire world is searching for them, especially given the uncertainty surrounding the global supply. Considering the trade war with the United States, implementing critical mineral projects will increase our resilience and strengthen our sovereignty. Can the minister talk about the importance of critical minerals and the work the Government of Canada is proposing to accelerate their development?"
"Before I give the floor to the parliamentary secretary, questions are through the Chair. I have not done things. The hon. parliamentary secretary."
"Will the Secretary of State confirm that the Government will ensure that Thames Water stands by its commitment to upgrade our sewage network in South Buckinghamshire? Specifically, will he ensure that the upgrade promised for the Little Marlow sewage treatment works in my constituency is delivered on time?"
"Mr. Speaker, I wish I could answer that with data that showed how many people would come in under this. Would that not be nice? However, the government does not have that information. How can it go to the provinces and say that it is going to cost them x amount of dollars in health care over x period of time, that it is going to cost them x amount in social services benefits or other types of social payments, or that it is going to impact the number of jobs or the future levels? It cannot do that, and that is why it failed in the immigration system. The government has treated the immigration ministry like the armpit of cabinet. It has had—"
The secretary of state for combatting crime.
"I commend the Chancellor on her statement, and I pay tribute to her, and to my right hon. Friend the Welsh Secretary and all my Welsh Labour colleagues for their advocacy in standing up for Wales at this spending review. I particularly welcome the investment in coal tips, which will be really important in constituencies across Wales, and in rail, with PS445 million to turn the tide on 14 years of under-investment by the Conservatives, of whom four are left on the Opposition Benches. As she is here, can I take this opportunity to ask her whether, given the substantial rail investment that has been announced, she will use her good offices to support a campaign in my constituency for Ely Mill station to be built? Now all the stakeholders have the money they need, they can get on with it, can they not?"
I absolutely join my hon. Friend in recognising that Blackpool is louder and prouder when it comes to Pride and celebrating our LGBT community. I hope he has a fantastic day there; I have seen him at Manchester Pride many times before.
"I was not going to say anything in this round of ping pong, but a couple of things in the debate have tempted me to my feet. The first thing I want to say is about the House of Lords. I have to say that I congratulate their lordships on their tenacity on this issue; I think we both expected and presumed that they would have backed down a long time ago, but they have decided not to, and I think that is because of what I have heard today. They are backing the sector. It has been left to the Lords to ensure that the voices of our artists and those in our creative industries and sectors are adequately articulated and presented to Ministers, so I congratulate them on that. I say that as somebody who is no great respecter of the House of Lords--I have this cute little notion that someone serving in a legislature should be elected to that legislature. The Lords have done an exemplary job in all this, and they are entirely entitled to bring forward this matter again and again until the ministerial team find some sort of compromise, which, between the two of them, they will surely be able to do. This is the territory we are in now; this is the fourth round of ping pong. It is no good us just sending it back to the Lords again and again. The Government can insist and get their way, of course: they are the Government, and this is the primary House in our Parliament, so they can do that if they want. But why would they not sit down and work out a way forward that takes on board everything the Lords want to achieve and secure and that meets the noble ambitions and lofty rhetoric we have heard from those on the Government Front Bench today and the last few times this has been debated? I cannot see anything wrong with the amendment. It sounds like the Minister is inventing reasons as to why it could not be agreed to. The example from the Digital Economy Act is spot on: we were adaptable and did things as the situation required in order to meet the  challenge of the time--a huge challenge, when digitisation was coming into our creative arts. This is a bigger challenge and test. This is more existential than the Digital Economy Act of 20 years ago, and that is why we must act now. People cannot wait. Our cultural heritage is being scraped and hoovered up by large tech companies, and soon there will be nothing left of it. Millions of creative artists are waiting for the Government to engage--to sort it out, compromise and do something with those with an interest in all this. The Government are convincing no one thus far; the creative industries do not believe that they have their best interests at heart or that we will have enough time to secure what is left of our cultural heritage. The Government should do something--do not just send the Bill away again, although they probably will, and have it come back to us. Sit down, compromise and get something sorted out and, for the sake of our creative industries, find a solution that works for everybody. Question put, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 49F."
"Mr. Speaker, the housing crisis is only getting worse, and the Liberals' failing programs are not helping. The Liberals' so-called housing accelerator fund is spending more but building less. The Liberals' own numbers show that Kelowna will receive $31.5 million in taxpayer dollars, even though housing starts there are down 33.6%. Will the Liberals abandon their failing housing programs and build homes, not more bureaucracy?"
I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Steil).
"I understand that the member is new and that these things happen. Essentially, the process is that, if the app does not work when a member is in the lobby or in any other situation, the member can come in and, after the vote has been called, get up and say that the app did not work and that they would like their vote to be counted one way or the other. That is the proper procedure. The member's vote would not count unless he gets up and asks for unanimous consent for his vote to count."
"I rise to the three-minute challenge. We hear that this is the biggest investment in social and affordable housing in a generation. I am sure we all remember the day when we got the keys to our first home and how that felt. We are told there will be PS39 billion over 10 years, but the real test is whether it reaches the councils and communities that need it the most. As ever, we need detail and clarity, and once again it is lacking from this Government and these estimates--I fear that is because of their pursuit of their ideologically driven utopia. Will the Government commit to publishing the regional allocation of local authority housing and affordable homes programme funds, which is critical to understanding the impact on our own communities? We must ensure that funding flows to not just city regions, but towns such as Walsall and the Walsall borough, where my constituency sits. Local authorities must have fair access to the affordable homes programme and to infrastructure support. I have previously expressed my concerns in a debate on the Planning and Infrastructure Bill about the lack of democratic accountability that this Government will create in their approach to planning. A further point, which has been expressed by the National Association of Local Councils, is that the Minister's Department is not proceeding with commissioning new neighbourhood  planning support services from 2025. I feel that that is just another kick in the teeth for local parish and town councils. I know that the Minister is a good man and brings loads of experience to this place from his time in local government, but I do not believe that his Government are interested in local communities, preferring to drive a coach and horses over our precious green spaces. I look at how Birmingham's housing targets are being slashed, yet ours across the Walsall borough are being hiked up. Maybe it is because Birmingham is incompetent and cannot empty its bins, but I will leave that for another day. These are arbitrary, Whitehall-driven and centralised targets. I have long campaigned for development to happen on brownfield first, but that needs real funding for remediation, infrastructure and up-front costs. Under Andy Street's leadership and a Conservative Government, we showed in the west midlands that we can remediate brownfield sites--look at the Caparo and Harvestime sites--and deliver for local people, but we need funding, which is lacking in this estimate. A failure to remediate is a failure to regenerate our towns, cities, communities and local economies. I have done it in less than three minutes, Madam Deputy Speaker."
"Mr. Chair, it is not up to me to enact legislation. It is up to the House."
"High Speed 2 owns vast swathes of the Staffordshire countryside. In fact, it owns a third of all the properties in the village of Hopton, which is having an enormous impact on residents and causing an enormous blight. Could the Chancellor set out for the House, and for so many residents right across Staffordshire, when we will know whether farmers are  going to have their land back and whether villages will be able to return to normal life, with people moving into the empty houses?"
"Mr. Chair, what we are focused on here tonight is talking about the main estimates and talking about how we get our country going again. How we do that is we approve—"
"Baroness Casey's audit was conducted in just four months but looked at some of the issues in considerable detail. It also sets out the fact that we have had 16 years of different reports and inquiries--that includes some of the issues around the 200-page report that my hon. Friend refers to, and other reports as well. The crucial thing is that we need action. Victims and survivors need answers, and we need to pursue serious failings wherever they are found, but we must also ensure that when recommendations are made, they are implemented."
"I thank my hon. Friend for that question. As she will know from the many times I have said it before, I do regularly remind the Cabinet that this is an important aspect of being a Cabinet Minister, or indeed a Minister. We are doing our very best to make sure that there are regular oral statements to this House on important matters and that they are brought here first. In the absence of an oral statement, there is a written ministerial statement, of which notice is given the day before so that colleagues have ample time, as she says, to properly scrutinise all these announcements."
"I am content that this Government have deported more foreign national offenders than the previous Government. I am content that we have accepted the findings of the Gauke review, and we will be bringing the early removal scheme threshold from 50% down to 30% to make that sure more foreign offenders are eligible for removal from our country."
"Mr. Speaker, it is a great question. Again, there is this mirage that the Quebec member spoke about. All of a sudden, this guy who is supposed to be a responsible spender of taxpayer dollars is not. I just mentioned how he is going to spend dramatically more than what the irresponsible Trudeau government already spent in the previous 10 years. Is that even possible? Yes, it is, because they are going to do it. Under Trudeau's plan, the federal debt interest would have reached a projected $66.3 billion in 2029, compared to $68.7 billion under the new Prime Minister 's plan. That is the truth. Regardless of how he is accounting and fudging the numbers, or whatever process he is trying to do, he is spending more. Canadians cannot afford it, and we need a change in government, bottom line."
"I am here too to focus on some history and a resolution. Today is the 95th anniversary of one of the worst economic policies our country ever made: the Smoot-Hawley tariffs. Don't just take my word for it. The Senate Historical Office has characterized it as ``among the most catastrophic acts in congressional history.'' So today I am introducing a resolution that commemorates this anniversary as a moment to reflect on the devastating impact and the consequences. It shows you what we can learn from history, and at its peak, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act placed an average rate of 20 percent tariffs on goods imported into the United States--just 20 percent. So we have had this big discussion about many other things, definitely well above 20 percent. The goal then was to bolster U.S. farmers and manufacturers by protecting them from foreign competition. But that goal, as we all know, if you study history, was not met. What it did instead was widen and deepen the Great Depression. My resolution recounts our major trading partners, including Canada and countries in Europe, responded to those tariffs placed on by the United States by raising tariffs on the United States' exported goods. So yes, let's say a trade war. And anti-United States sentiment rapidly intensified in foreign countries, leading to a consumer boycott of American products in Canada, France, Spain, Italy, and many other countries. The retaliatory tariffs and consumer boycotts caused farm and manufacturing exports from the United States to plunge from 68 percent, basically $5.24 billion, in 1929, to basically $1.6 billion--so from $5 billion to basically $1 billion in 1933, so a big drop in what the United States was able to do. The U.S. gross domestic product fell nearly in half, from $104 billion in 1929 to just $57 billion in 1932. And the unemployment rate rose from 3.2 percent to a peak of around 23 percent in 1932. So the Great Depression had arrived. In my State, the State of Washington, we have always been dependent on trade. Back then, lumber was our main export, and the trade war essentially destroyed that industry. Production dropped 70 percent, and the board feet dropped down to just 2 billion board feet in 1932--more than cutting in half what we had done before. More than half of our State's loggers lost their jobs. The unemployment rate in my State was 33 percent much higher than the national average. And where do we stand 95 years later? Do we want to take a moment and understand the lessons of Smoot-Hawley? The administration is running a very high tariff playbook. The world's economy is much more interconnected now than it was in the 1930s. Uncertainty is the enemy of continued economic growth. And at least the Smoot-Hawley tariffs were set at an established rate. American businesses knew what they were standing up against and could make forecasts and plans accordingly. These tariffs in the Trump administration change at the discretion of the President, creating huge uncertainty. Small business owners in my State tell me that while the tariffs are a challenge, the uncertainty is what keeps them up at night. The administration's tariffs are on par with Smoot-Hawley era tariffs. On that, the economic historians agree: That was a prolonged and deepened global depression. Last week, the President said the tariffs on China would be set at 55 percent. So what have we learned from this historical date? Before President Hoover signed the Smoot-Hawley Act, he got a signed letter from more than 1,000 economists--1,000 economists sent a letter. The economists warned that raising tariffs would cause the cost to rise on consumers; farmers and manufacturers would suffer; and retaliatory tariffs would make exports dry up. And they said that starting a trade war would damage our foreign relations. As early as 1934, Congress tried to right the ship. That year, we passed the Reciprocal Tariff Act directing Presidents to reduce us and world tariff rates. This year, my colleague Senator Grassley and I are trying to stop the administration by introducing the Trade Review Act of 2025 that establishes limits on the President's ability to impose tariffs. Why? Because this is the constitutional power given to Congress, not to the President. The courts have already said at certain levels that this President, as it relates to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, does not have this authority. So out of the ashes of World War Two, the U.S. led in a way of creating an open and rules-based international trading system. Tariffs were lowered in the U.S. and abroad--falling in the U.S.--from a trade weighted average of 20 percent in '33 to 7 percent in 1950 and continuing to fall afterward with trade agreements. So it means we established rules. That is what trade needs. We don't need a President whose authority isn't in this particular area to start trade wars with no end in sight. The rules-based trading system provided the stability we needed to drive investment and to drive growth. So the resolution I am introducing today asked the Senate to affirm the importance of a rules-based trade policy that reduces production costs for American farmers, for manufacturers, and one that opens markets to US exports. It is time for us to commit to encouraging trade policies, particularly when so many other countries are getting their products on the shelves in foreign markets, leaving our products at home. Let's avoid the repetition of this historical policy mistake and instead do something that reaffirms this institution's oversight of this issue and recognize the problems that tariffs are causing."
"I rise to speak to amendment 27, which would require the doses and types of lethal drugs to be properly licensed by the MHRA. It is important that I put it on the record that I do not think the Bill is safe. It does not provide adequate safeguards. Most importantly, it will deepen and exacerbate inequalities. On that, I know that I speak for tens of thousands of disabled people who rightly say, ""We need assistance to live, not to die."" Throughout the passage of the Bill, hon. Members across the House have received many letters and briefings from leading experts, including this week a letter from over 1,000 doctors across all areas of medical practice expressing their clear view that the Bill does not provide answers on how we can improve management of the end of people's lives. They said that the drugs expected to be used in assisted deaths should undergo rigorous testing and approval, as would be required for any other prescribed medication. Those requirements are missing from the Bill. Indeed, there is nothing in the Bill requiring lethal drugs to be regulated by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. That is contrary to good medical practice. Many of us will have heard that in Oregon, complications with drugs used for assisted dying occurred in about 7% of deaths and included vomiting, seizures and prolonged deaths of up to 137 hours. Where is the requirement in the Bill to inform patients about how those risks, including prolonged dying, might be managed? Where is the plan to identify the most acceptable medications? If they have not already done so, I urge hon. Members to consider this letter, signed by many leading experts. If we do not listen to them--the very people who would have to implement the Bill--who will we listen to?"
That is a matter of debate. I will let the parliamentary secretary continue.
"My constituents constantly tell me that Thames Water is failing in its duties and has no financial future. In spite of its failings, we are reliant on it for the most basic human needs of water and sanitation. Will the Leader of the House allow us Government time to scrutinise in detail the merits of turning Thames Water into a public benefit company?"
I yield 7 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).
"I declare the motion carried. (Bill read the second time and the House went into committee of the whole thereon, Tom Kmiec in the chair) (On clause 2)"
"Israel dealing with Hamas and Hezbollah is to be welcomed, but the continuing blockage on medical and humanitarian aid going into Gaza is not welcome. As we continue to talk, children continue to die. I hope that the Foreign Secretary will make it very clear that the continuation of children dying every single day is unacceptable, and that he will  stand up to the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon and to the Knesset and the current Israeli Government of Netanyahu. These deaths are just going on and on and on. How many more children need to die before something changes?"
"As Liberal Democrats, we have been concerned about the lack of a draft Bill on conversion practices, so I am relieved to hear what the Minister has said today. However, given the amount of fear and anxiety that there is among the trans community in this country, can she reassure the House that when the Bill comes forward, it will be UK-wide to overcome the Scottish Government's withdrawal of their proposals? Further, will the Government consider whether we need fresh legislation to deal with  all the issues in the Equality Act that have been raised by the Equality and Human Rights Commission's interim guidance and the Supreme Court judgment?"
"As part of the process that we go to from here, Great British Energy Nuclear will look at what is the right place for the SMR fleet and, absolutely, Oldbury is one of the candidates."
"I cannot believe it, but I agree with the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Ms Creasy). It is a shock to the system, but the Chief Secretary has announced the return of the public-private partnership. The last Labour Government were a byword for disastrous contractual negotiations, and that led to the infamous PS1,000 lightbulb. Given that Labour was so bad at these contract negotiations last time around, what confidence does the Chief Secretary have that he will be any better this time around?"
"I want to pay tribute to a true patriot and beloved member of our South Jersey community, John ``Ghost'' Carman. John recently passed away after an incredibly courageous fight with cancer that began November of last year. John fought until the very end with incredible strength and grace. At the age of 18, John married the love of his life, JoAnn. They shared 47 beautiful years together and raised two children, Cherie and John the third. He was a hardworking man who made his mark in Atlantic City's construction industry, contributing to many of the city's major casino projects. John showed his love for the community by serving in public office, including positions on Egg Harbor Township Committee and Town Board for Municipal Authority. He was devoted to our country, serving most recently as the Treasurer of the American Legion Post in Somers Point, South Jersey. As John's friends and family would say, ``to know John was to love him,'' and he will be greatly missed, but we are eternally grateful for his lasting legacy and love he left behind. God bless John and God bless our United States of America. The greatest country in the world."
"today, I come to the floor to speak about a favorite topic that my friends know I am proud of, protecting whistleblowers and the roles that they play in government. I have long held that government oversight can't be done without the patriotic work of whistleblowers. Even Department and Agency heads need whistleblowers to know what is really going on in their respective Departments and Agencies. I tell people that come to my office before their Senate confirmation that whether you are in a very small number of employees Agency or, you know, hundreds of thousands of employees in our Agency, you are at the top; you can't know what is going on at the bottom. And you need to listen to whistleblowers, and they usually come forward with very important information. When they don't get that respect from the Department heads, they usually end up coming to the Congress, and many of them come to the office of this Senator. Just this year, to show you the importance of whistleblowers, I made records public, exposing the political origin of Arctic Frost. Arctic Frost is the case that ultimately became one of Jack Smith's cases against President Trump. Anti-Trump FBI agents and Department of Justice prosecutors started Arctic Frost. Based on even more records that I have made public, those very same anti-Trump FBI agents were involved in the investigation and prosecution of Peter Navarro, now serving with President Trump in the White House, like he did in the first Trump administration. Those agents that took on Peter Navarro were Assistant Special Agent in Charge Thibault and Special Agent Walter Giardina. Whistleblowers have also disclosed to me that J.P. Cooney wanted to potentially open yet another case on Trump. J.P. Cooney was Jack Smith's deputy. Allegedly, Cooney wanted to use compulsory process to obtain more information. He improperly based that desire to do so, in large part, on partisan news outlets. And guess who was included in the communication about the new case against Trump? That same person's name shows up, Special Agent WalterGiardina. I will have more to speak on that matter later. Whistleblowers have told me that Special Agent Giardina openly stated his desire to investigate Trump, even if it meant false predication. I have been able to make all these records publicly available because of brave, patriotic whistleblowers. They are patriots to the highest order. And a lot of this information that I received from whistleblowers wouldn't have been made available or even known that it existed without the help of these whistleblowers. And because of those whistleblowers, it is now an absolute fact that these cases against President Trump and his associates were politically motivated. My investigative work won't rest. There will be much more coming from this Senator."
The hon. member has the floor.
"Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand."
"Mr. Chair, what is the number?"
"The long-term viability of pharmacies and, indeed, the whole NHS was under threat from the right hon. Gentleman and his party, but thanks to this Government, it is being made fit for the future. This is a serious issue for all our constituents, and we want to make the system work better. The right hon. Gentleman will see from the 10-year plan that we will make the NHS fit for his constituents, mine and those of every other Member."
"Does the Secretary of State monitor the number of private nursery closures? If so, can she tell us how many have closed since the Budget?"
"I rise today to urge my colleagues to approve my bipartisan legislation, H.R. 252, the Secure Our Ports Act. This bill is designed to strengthen our national security by prohibiting foreign adversaries from owning and operating critical infrastructure in the United States. China's influence and access to critical infrastructure around the world continues to grow. Some reports indicate China owns or operates ports and terminals at nearly 100 locations in over 50 countries. Last year, the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party issued a report highlighting its national security concerns over the influence of critical port infrastructure by Chinese-owned enterprise. More recently, the Defense Department included a number of Chinese shipping firms to a list of companies it identifies as military in nature. America's ports are essential gateways for trade and commerce which provide the foundation of our economy as well as our national security. Allowing foreign adversaries like China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran to own and operate port infrastructure would threaten that very foundation and creates a serious liability. Congress must take action and protect this vital infrastructure by passing the Secure Our Ports Act. In closing, I thank my California colleague,   John Garamendi, for cosponsoring this bill and making the bipartisan effort as well as Carlos Gimenez of Florida. I also thank the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, my friend Sam Graves, for steering this bill through the Committee. America's ports are vital to our economic and national security, and I urge all my colleagues to approve this bill."
"I recognise the benefit that the construction of Type 31 frigates has brought to Rosyth, and I have personally engaged with international partners to try to secure future orders. In addition to any orders that we ourselves may have, exporting that type of capability to our allies and friends is a sensible way of ensuring that we can keep production going at Rosyth."
"Mr. Speaker, I look forward to visiting my colleague's farming establishment in the Timiskaming area. Certainly it was good to see, as part of the “Canada Strong” plan, that there is a role for the regional development agencies. For us in northern Ontario, under the minister overseeing FedNor, our regional development agency, we are very pleased to see that there is going to be a role also for the Crown corporations that support our territory. In Timiskaming, there is a strong presence by the Farm Credit Canada corporation, and we look forward to a continued role for that organization in our territory."
"Order. Please, let us listen to the answer, even if you do not believe you are getting one. It is how the Prime Minister wishes to do it."
"Mr. Speaker, I welcome the hon. member opposite, and congratulations on your election. I can hear in your voice the genuine concern for the people in your riding, so I am wondering this: Will you join municipal councils and other people in this province to call on the province to increase ODSP rates and Ontario Works rates, to build affordable housing, to scrap the removal of rent control, to hire more judges and to build more courts?"
"This is a bit rich--unbelievable. With inflation above 11% and the biggest tax rises, I will take no lectures from the Conservative party. On this issue in particular, they cannot make up their minds. First, they said our reforms were taking too long, then they said they were rushed, then their Front Bench said our measures were too tough, and now they say they need to be tougher. No plan, no idea--I wonder why their party was left in such a mess."
"Oh, oh!"
"Mr. Speaker, it is the same old government with the same old failed solutions. The housing crisis did not just happen; it is the direct result of 10 years of Liberal government mismanagement. After only a decade, rent in Canada has doubled, the amount required for a down payment to buy a home has doubled and mortgages have doubled. The dream of owning a home in Canada is slipping away for many Canadians. When will the minister understand that doing more of the same and having the same failed policies is not going to result in a solution for Canadians?"
The hon. member.
"Mr. Speaker, I am rising on a point of order with respect to the upcoming votes at report stage on Bill C-5 . Page 788 of House of Commons Procedure and Practice , third edition, states: When the Speaker selects and groups motions in amendment, he or she also decides on how they will be grouped for voting, that is, the Speaker determines the order in which the motions in amendment will be called and the effect of one vote on the others. The purpose of the voting scheme is to obviate any requirement for two or more votes on the same issue. The Speaker delivers his or her decision regarding the grouping of motions in amendment after the order for the consideration of report stage of the bill has been read. The Speaker informs the House of the motions in amendment that he or she has selected and grouped for debate, the voting arrangements, and, where applicable, the motions in amendment that have not been selected, stating the reasons for this. Speakers have sometimes intervened at a later stage of the debate to revise the selection and grouping for debate of the motions in amendment. It is with respect to this latter point I am now rising. Specifically, Mr. Speaker, you have grouped Motions Nos. 18 and 19. Motion No. 18, sponsored by my Bloc Québécois colleague, seeks to add the Canada Labour Code to the list of laws that are carved out from the scope of clauses 21 and 22 of the proposed building Canada act, the so-called Henry VIII clauses in the bill. Motion No. 19, sponsored by the Green member , would seek to add the Species at Risk Act to that same list. One concerns workers' rights, and the other is environmental in nature. These are, I would suspect, very distinct policy fields and merit separate votes. Moreover, on procedural grounds, I would note that the Species at Risk Act is already listed in the building Canada act's proposed schedule 2. The member for Saanich—Gulf Islands had proposed a companion amendment in Motion No. 26, which would have removed it from the list, but this motion was not selected for debate today. This means that the substantive effect of the motion concerning the Canada Labour Code, if adopted, would be that this law may never be added to schedule 2. On the other hand, the combined effect of the rulings on Motions Nos. 19 and 26, if Motion No. 19, respecting the Species at Risk Act, is adopted, would be that this law may not be added back to schedule 2, should it ever be removed by the Governor in Council at some point in the future. In summary, Motions Nos. 18 and 19 are two separate motions proposed by members from two separate parties concerning very different subject matter and with two different procedural implications. In other words, separate votes on Motions Nos. 18 and 19 would not amount to two votes on the same issue. Accordingly, I would respectfully submit that this is a textbook instance for the Chair to exercise the authority described in Bosc and Gagnon to revisit and revise the voting pattern established for the report stage of Bill C-5 ."
"I know that many of my hon. Friends were concerned to hear about my generosity in the Tea Room. It was simply that we were very tired and I bought an espresso for the Minister, just once. I did offer one to the Lib Dem spokesman, but I have not delivered on that promise--"
"Mr. Speaker, as anyone who has been in private business knows, the two things we look for the most are predictability and stability. We have a Prime Minister now who cannot even be bothered to bring in a budget. I wonder what the hon. member across the aisle thinks of that."
"Madam Speaker, in response to the heckling, it was not zero. I will admit I do not know the number."
"Really badly delivered roadworks, which are often unco-ordinated, can be a huge blight on local businesses, town centres and others. I hear what the hon. Member is saying. These are the responsibilities of local councils and we are putting more money into making sure that roads can be put right, but I will definitely ensure that he gets a reply."
"I commend the Home Secretary for the dignified way in which she gave her statement. I associate myself with her apology to the victims and survivors of sexual exploitation and grooming gangs for past failures. I welcome the Government having accepted the recommendations of Baroness Casey's rapid audit and the announcement of a national criminal operation to pursue and convict perpetrators. Justice for victims of these horrific crimes must always be our top priority. West Yorkshire police have taken a proactive approach to securing justice for victims. As recently as January this year, eight men were given jail sentences of nearly 58 years for multiple sexual offences against two children in Keighley in the 1990s. Will she join me in commending the work of West Yorkshire police in bringing the perpetrators of those vile crimes to justice?"
"I intend to speak briefly, and I draw the House's attention to my role as chair of the parliamentary group for the GMB, the union that represents the largest number of workers on the parliamentary estate, and to my declarations to that effect in the Register of Members' Financial Interests. Parliament is, on the whole, a more professional, safer and more sober place to work than it once was. Such progress, however, is no excuse for complacency. Inappropriate and predatory behaviour can occur anywhere, but the risk factors are higher here, and I pay tribute to  all the workplace representatives who have worked quietly down the years to raise standards and challenge poor practice in this place. I welcome the steps outlined in the motion to clarify and strengthen the ICGS, and I also wish to comment briefly on the Opposition amendments. The shadow Leader of the House said that amendment (e) will not be moved, but we did not hear about amendment (a), which is in the name of a Back-Bench MP, but is co-signed by the shadow deputy Chief Whip, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Joy Morrissey). If I have understood the amendment correctly, it would strike out the scope for collective complaints, and it would block the investigation of complaints if a police investigation has not resulted in a conviction, even though the standard of proof is different for the two things. The amendments would also, as far as I can tell, prevent the reinvestigation of a complaint if a respondent succeeds in persuading or pressurising a complainant into withdrawing. That point was made powerfully by the hon. Member for Chelmsford (Marie Goldman). Amendment (a) could provide a cover for abuse, were it agreed. That is plain and apparent, and it is a matter of deep regret that it appears to have some degree of sponsorship from the Opposition. While I do not wish to depart today from the recommendations of the Kernaghan report, I will raise some matters on workforce representation. We have already heard that the workforce representatives in this place will continue to be consulted, and that is welcome. Can the Leader of the House confirm whether workforce representatives will be able to attend meetings of the assurance board in an observer capacity? It would also be good to hear whether there will be scope for direct representation of those workforce voices on the assurance board. That would improve its functioning. I know that she recently met GMB reps to discuss those same concerns, and I hope that she can comment further tonight. Finally, some 7,000 people provide support to parliamentarians. They all deserve to work in a modern environment, secure in the knowledge that there is a robust and independent process providing accountability and redress if they are mistreated. The politicisation of those processes in recent years is deeply regrettable, and I hope that cross-party support for them can be swiftly restored."
It is a disaster.
"Madam Chair, the member would appreciate that by reducing taxes, we are helping all Canadians. The measure we just announced will help 22 million Canadians."
"I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McDowell). Mr. McDOWELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Ezell for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 2351, which will strengthen the ability of the United States Coast Guard to respond effectively to opioid overdose situations. The Coast Guard is on the front lines of the fight against fentanyl, working to stop traffickers at sea and saving lives in the process. This bill will ensure that they have the tools needed to do just that, because when an overdose happens, there is no time to wait. This bill will give the Coast Guard broader authority to prosecute cases where illicit drugs are discovered on unmanned vessels or smuggled onboard without the knowledge of the crew. This bill also ensures that Coast Guard facilities have naloxone and other similar medications on hand to treat overdoses, bringing the Coast Guard in line with other branches of the military. By giving our coastguardsmen and -women access to naloxone, we are giving them the ability to save lives at sea and protect themselves should they come into contact with these deadly drugs. Put simply, we have their backs, and they have ours. This commonsense bill will make it easier and safer for our servicemembers to protect our maritime borders with confidence when intercepting these poisons before they reach our communities. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes.''"
"Efficiently and correctly, but also transparently, and I hope all local authorities do fully, properly and accessibly account for their spending to their residents."
"I was disappointed to see the findings of yesterday's Civil Aviation Authority airport accessibility performance report, which outlined that three airports--Edinburgh, London Heathrow and Glasgow Prestwick--received a ""needs improvement"" rating for accessibility. Can my hon. Friend provide an update on when the aviation accessibility task and finish group's recommendations will be published, and when the Government will be able to outline how they plan to introduce measures to support disabled people who wish to access air travel?"
"Mr. Speaker, I would first like to congratulate my colleague from Toronto—St. Paul's. She is an extraordinary colleague. I have had a chance to see her in action in so many ways. She held various senior posts in finance as well, and we could see that in her speech. I am sure the people of Toronto—St. Paul's have been watching tonight at home and listening to her and saying that this is someone who understands finance; this is someone who understands how to build a country; this is someone who is going to make a great contribution to the House of Commons. I think we should all be listening to her and learning from her. I even see my Conservative colleagues so enthusiastic about listening and engaging with her because they want to learn as well. I know them. They want to learn. It is great to see so many Conservatives wanting to learn from an hon. member who knows something about finance. She really provided to all the colleagues this kind of overarching chapeau about everything we are doing to support Canadians, and there are a lot of learnings. I saw that the Conservatives were taking notes. That is a good sign. When they are taking notes, they see all the good things we are doing. In particular, the member talked about the health transfer. She talked about equalization. She talked about all the transfers to help Canadians, the people in Toronto—St. Paul's and across the nation. However, there is one other measure she mentioned. Housing is an issue. It is an issue in Toronto, but also around the country. The member talked about one of the measures, which is the elimination of GST for first-time homebuyers. On a home of up to $1 million, people can save up to $50,000. This is very significant. I can see the impact it is having in Canada. That is the type of policy that Canadians want to see. I can see the enthusiasm even from the Conservatives because they voted in favour. For once, they did the right thing and voted for Canadians."
[ Chair read text of motion to House ]
"A recent cyber-attack on schools and early learning IT in my constituency knocked out online access, but also underlined the need for a positive interaction between Scotland's two Governments, rather than the constant constitutional bickering we have seen in recent years. With cyber-security about to move out of the Cabinet Office, can the Minister assure us about the way in which a positive cross-governmental and intergovernmental approach to these relationships will be secured?"
"Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am happy to chat with the member. He is speaking to me directly by using the word “you”, and in doing so, not answering the question."
"I declare an interest, as a member of the Modernisation Committee. I thank you, Mr Speaker, for standing up for us Back Benchers and for granting so many urgent questions--I say that as someone who speaks in most of them on behalf of the people of Harlow. Does the Leader of the House agree that part of the Government's remit is to modernise and to bring back trust in politics? Will she outline what she has been doing to that end and the work that the Committee has been doing to make this place more accessible?"
"Wales has incredible potential for the next generation of nuclear, but Labour's announcement yesterday is a fraction of what is needed. Green baseload power that stabilises our grid enhances power generation, as it has done before in Anglesey. Will the Minister give a clearer answer today to confirm that Wales will be a key part of new nuclear, building on Conservative work supporting Welsh nuclear, or will this be another failure to deliver for these communities under Labour?"
"My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We are engaging with the Scottish Government. Today's expansion creates more resources for the Scottish Government to ensure that direct bill support is provided  to more households. Alongside that, there has to be a plan to upgrade homes and to make sure that we are delivering homes that are warmer and cheaper to run. We will have a plan here, and we expect that, with the additional funding and the example that we have set, the Scottish Government will follow suit, but we are long past the stage of warm words and light action. We need to get on with it, because there are people across the country, including in Scotland, who are struggling. It is the responsibility of Government to get a grip and start to act."
"I see a huge role. I hope that my hon. Friend took the commitment that the Chancellor and I made, alongside the spring statement, to set a new target for direct defence investment in SMEs, as a sign of that commitment. While I am in the business of committing my ministerial colleagues to meetings, I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Defence Procurement and Industry would be only too happy to meet her and to draw on her expertise as part of the development of our defence industrial strategy."
"I have spoken about the perilous decline of the situation in the west bank and, indeed, the events of the past two weeks. I have also spoken about the importance of co-ordinating with allies, so I do not think that I have anything further to say about the timing of the announcement."
"We have to leave it at that. I am sorry. Resuming debate, the hon. member for Calgary Signal Hill."
"Mr. Chair, did KPMG report the government could save money by spending billions more?"
"I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time."
"On that point, will the hon. Member give way?"
"The clarity is that there will no longer be any checks. If they fly into Spain, they are flying into the Schengen area. If they fly into Malaga, they are free to drive to Gibraltar without checks--they would already have had those checks. The same applies in the other direction."
"This is a Chancellor who has brought stability and growth back to the economy and got wages growing once again; one who is driving investment in our public services, which will rescue them; one who has driven up public investment, which is crucial to showing that, once again, we are a country that can do the basics like building houses, filling potholes and the rest."
"When we speak of the mineworkers' pension, we speak of everyone who has sustained our pits, such as my constituents Anthony Peck, who joined the scheme aged 17, and Kevin Jowle, automatically enrolled when he became a deputy, without any consultation. Does the Minister agree that everyone deserves a fair pension and compensation for the PS3.2 billion that the Treasury has received to date?"
"Madam Speaker, I am always impressed by the member for Winnipeg North 's ability to warp reality. He is so darn good at it. Earlier, he was talking about what people heard while they were going door to door. I can assure him that, at the doors I knocked on, people were outraged about the government paying $34 billion to expand a pipeline. If anyone were to talk to Quebeckers today and tell them about plans to implement a bill that will help accelerate oil and gas infrastructure, not one of them would be okay with that. I would actually encourage his colleagues from Quebec to tell him what they heard, because I am absolutely sure that message would be very different from the one he heard in his riding."
The hon. member.
"Mr. Chair, assuming proponents bring projects forward, they will go to the designated minister, as the member says. They will use the criteria that was agreed by the Prime Minister —"
"Mr. Speaker, Canada is the third-largest oil-producing country in the world. That is something we should be proud of. In Saskatchewan, where I come from, we have a phrase: Lead, follow, or get out of the way. These guys cannot lead, and they are too arrogant to follow, so they should at least get out of the way."
What assessment he has made of the potential impact of extending the warm home discount to all households in receipt of means-tested benefits on people receiving those benefits
"Mr. Speaker, I agree that this is a crisis. Children in Kitchener are increasingly affected by food insecurity, with 14,418 children using the food bank in the last quarter of 2024. Every child in Canada deserves the fundamental right to grow up free from hunger. Food is not a privilege; it is a necessity. A transparent, well-funded national budget must reflect this priority, outlining clear, actionable plans to eliminate food insecurity and support families across this country. Will the Liberal government table a budget this spring?"
"Mr. Speaker, as I said, it is important. The government announced a cap on greenhouse gas emissions for the oil and gas sector last December. It held consultations, as it always does for this kind of regulation. It is one of the tools that we have in our tool box. We remain committed to achieving net zero by 2050."
"I appreciate my hon. Friend's welcome for the PS2.1 billion for the West Yorkshire combined authority, which will help pay for mass transit to connect Leeds and Bradford, but also Kirklees and Calderdale. In today's statement we were able to provide money for free school meals for 500,000 children, lifting 100,000 out of poverty, as well as continuing to roll out breakfast clubs and the warm homes programme, which will help insulate properties and bring down bills for millions of families. In addition, we have increased the national living wage by nearly 7%, and the Employment Rights Bill will ensure that more people have security and dignity at work--all part of our plan for change and lifting children and families out of poverty."
"The hon. Gentleman is a bright man. He knows that once a country has acquired the means to enrich to 60%, the expertise exists, and only a diplomatic solution can create the framework to eradicate and control that expertise. That is why, in the end, this can be dealt with only diplomatically. It is also why President Trump is urging Iran to return to the negotiating table."
"As if this situation could not get any worse, we now have damning reports that Israeli fire is killing Palestinians trying to access aid at militarised distribution centres that are not sanctioned by the UN. It shows complete disregard for human life. Does the Minister agree that enough is enough, and that now is the time to take immediate, stronger, further action against the Israeli Government?"
"Mr. Speaker, let us first start with a fact, which is that there is no ban on gas-powered vehicles. More to the point, once again, we are seeing the Conservatives talking down one of our most important industries, which is employing hard-working auto workers in our country at the very moment we are facing tariff threats from the United States. I find it rich that the Conservatives are choosing to take this position instead of talking up a growing and important industry. We stand with our auto workers."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to two exceptional constituents of Brandon—Souris. Last Saturday, Souris residents Murray Zuk and the late Bill Kirkup were inducted as honorary life members into the Manitoba Baseball Hall of Fame. Murray Zuk helped found the Hall of Fame and Museum, serving as a director since its inception in 1997, with a significant career as a baseball scout and organizer in Manitoba, all while maintaining a remarkable career as principal of Souris School. The late Bill Kirkup was a builder and loved the game of baseball. He committed countless hours to promoting teams and various leagues throughout Manitoba and western Canada, in addition to supporting countless other initiatives and causes in our community. If there was a project to get done in Souris, it was very likely that Bill Kirkup was involved. To Murray, his wife Donni and the Zuk family; and to Bill's wife Sheila and the Kirkup family, I thank them both for a lifetime of service to the great game of baseball, to our hometown of Souris and to Manitoba. We are certainly better off because of the lives of Murray Zuk and the late Bill Kirkup."
"Today, my constituent Isla presented her petition, which has over 200,000 signatures, to No. 10 Downing Street. It calls for more investment in, and political will for, the early detection of pancreatic cancer. She and her brother Tam started the petition the night before he died, just weeks after his diagnosis. I am presenting this petition on behalf of Isla and the hundreds of thousands of others who lose loved ones because of the lack of early detection. ""The petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Government to consider the resource needs in relation to the research and development of tests for the early detection of pancreatic cancer, and ensure the appropriate tools are available to General Practitioners across the NHS"", and across the UK. Following is the full text of the petition: [The petition of residents of the United Kingdom, Declares that there are life-threateningly few tests for early detection of pancreatic cancer therefore reducing the availability of life-saving early treatment to patients. The petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Government to consider the resource needs in relation to the research and development of tests for the early detection of pancreatic cancer, and ensure the appropriate tools are available to General Practitioners across the NHS. And the petitioners remain, etc.] [P003080]"
"Obviously, I agree with my hon. Friend in lots of ways, but it is really important to dwell on the point that he made at the beginning of his question. Through these changes, the vast majority of pensioners--  over three quarters--will receive winter fuel payments this winter. We can give them the necessary reassurance that they do not need to do anything for that to happen, even if they are on a higher income."
"Mr. Chair, will the minister make the promise today to recoup that money for Canadians?"
"Madam Speaker, I love the hon. member's assertion that we need to be bold, we need to be ambitious and we need to be audacious. This is not the time for Canada to be timid. We talked about this during the election campaign because of the threats coming from the United States, but this bill is anything but bold. It is anything but ambitious and audacious. It is a very timid bill because it does not repeal the things that are holding our natural resource sector and our economy at bay: Bill C-69 , Bill C-48 , the industrial carbon tax and other mechanisms that need to be repealed for us to be bold. I wonder if the hon. member can comment a little more about that."
This is a precautionary measure. The Government would be irresponsible if we did not account for all possibilities at this time.
"When my right hon. Friend discusses with SNP Ministers, through announcements made this week, the huge employment opportunities that this Government have created for young people in Scotland, will he impress on them the urgent need to finally tackle the persistent--and in some areas widening--attainment gap faced by pupils from poorer backgrounds, not only in Fife but in South Lanarkshire? These concerns are often raised by residents of Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse."
"The UK has a real opportunity to lead the world in the production of sustainable aviation fuels, and this Bill aims to provide the investment certainty needed to scale up domestic SAF production and achieve just that. My constituency is located a stone's throw from London Luton airport. It is a rapidly expanding regional airport, and that expansion will bring with it huge economic benefits, including jobs for thousands of my constituents and better connections for business and leisure. Indeed, airport expansion will help to bring millions of people to the Universal UK theme park--which I have to mention every time I stand up--and play a key role in driving local economic growth. But just as it is important to support the growth of airports such as Luton, it is important that expansion happens as sustainably as possible to ensure that we get as many of the benefits, and as few of the harms, as possible. This is the subject of a current Environmental Audit Committee inquiry, which I was pleased to secure, investigating how the Government can deliver airport expansion while meeting their legally binding climate targets. Some, such as the Climate Change Committee, say that it is not possible, and the Government need to square that circle. With around 7% of greenhouse gases derived from aviation in the UK, we should not underestimate the challenge, but it is clear to me that sustainable aviation fuels are an important piece of the jigsaw. In my constituency of Mid Bedfordshire, Cranfield University and local industry are already working at the cutting edge of developing new technologies in this area. I have heard from them and other experts about the potential of British-made sustainable aviation fuels. I have even learned about second-generation SAF--not something that I thought I would get into this time last year--which turns the waste we all put in our black bins every week into the fuel that powers us to adventures abroad. That is a remarkable thing, and I am glad to have learned about it since coming into the House. If we get sustainable aviation fuels right, we can create and support thousands of highly skilled jobs in places such as Cranfield. Doing more to stimulate the development of sustainable aviation fuels is an obvious route to economic growth, so will the Minister reflect on our global market position,  explain how the mechanism compares with other approaches, and give an assurance that the measures in the Bill will be enough to avoid the UK aviation industry needing to import SAF from abroad? It would be a huge missed opportunity to later find that this mechanism and related policies have not been ambitious enough, leaving foreign countries to benefit from domestic mandates. One thing that strikes me immediately as worthy of more thought--the Minister may wish to comment--is black bin waste. Taking waste that was heading to landfill and instead using it to power us into the sky would seem to be a simple way forward, although whether there is enough of it is another matter. I declare my interest as a Central Bedfordshire councillor, but will the Minister consider the merits of including, in this Bill or elsewhere, a requirement for the Secretary of State to provide local authorities with guidance on how they can take advantage of this opportunity to help in the national effort to scale up production? Unless it is financially prohibitive for them to do so, would it not be sensible and pragmatic to let them use our household waste in this way, rather than let it head to landfill or local incinerators? Finally, I have a few questions for the Minister on the costs of aviation travel. As we all know, times are tight for many of our constituents. UK air passenger duty is the world's highest tax levied on airline passengers, and following the autumn Budget, the OBR forecasts that it will increase 9% a year on average to a whopping PS6.5 billion in 2029-30. On top of that, it is estimated that the impact of the Bill through the levy and administration costs will raise the cost of a ticket to travel. I know Ministers say that it is a modest increase, but that is why some may prefer the Government to use an alternative funding mechanism, such as the industry's contribution to the UK emissions trading scheme. I am not saying that the Government should take that approach, but it would be worthwhile for them to explain why they have taken the approach they have. Reflecting on the fact that the costs of the Bill come on top of the increase to air passenger duty in the autumn Budget, will the Minister provide an assurance that the Bill will not clobber our hard-working constituents with yet higher prices when they jet off on their family holiday?"
"With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I will make a statement about the Prax Lindsey oil refinery. Today its owners have declared insolvency at the refinery, and the Government are urgently acting in response to that deeply concerning news. I know that will be extremely worrying news for workers at the refinery, as well as for the wider community in Lincolnshire. Let me say very clearly that the Government stand with the workers, their families and the wider community at this difficult time. They have been let down by the company, but we will ensure that they are supported. Let me take the House through the chain of events leading up to today, and the actions that we will take in response. There have been long-standing issues at the refinery since it was acquired in 2021. At the end of April, the Government were informed of ongoing commercial difficulties, and the Energy Secretary met the chief executive on 13 May to see how the Government could provide support. The Secretary of State was reassured by the company that there was no immediate closure risk at the refinery. A week ago, the business changed its position, and said that it feared that it could no longer be a going concern. We repeatedly asked it, at an official and ministerial level, what the financial gap was, to work out whether the Government could help to bridge that gap, but the company was unable to share that basic information. As a result of today's decision by the company, an official receiver and administrators have been appointed to take over different parts of the business. The Government will ensure that supplies are maintained, protect our energy security, and do everything we can to support the workers, including engaging with trade unions and industry bodies. Let me update the House on the Government's response. First, we will work with the official receiver over the coming days and weeks to manage the situation at the Lindsey oil refinery site, and to determine the next steps. The official receiver will take immediate steps to ensure safe operations at the site, ensure continued fuel supply and explore all credible options for a sale. Unfortunately, the refinery has consistently failed to make a profit since it was bought by the current owners from Total in 2021; it has recorded a total of around PS75 million of losses between its acquisition in 2021 and the financial year ending February 2024. That has left the refinery in very bad shape, and the company has left the Government with very little time to act. We are supporting the official receiver in carrying out its statutory duties, including managing the situation on the site to determine next steps. That will include urgently reporting back on the steps, including all potential uses of the site, prior to the wind-down of the refinery. As to the wider business, extensive operational and financing interdependencies in the Prax Group mean that the refinery's parent company, State Oil Ltd, has also been placed into administration today, along with a small number of other group entities. However, other parts of the group, including its UK retail business, have not gone into administration. The retail business will trade as normal, while the administrators look to secure a sale in due course. Secondly, there are questions that must be answered about how the owners allowed this situation to happen. That is why my right hon. Friend the Energy Secretary has today written to the Insolvency Service to demand an immediate investigation of the conduct of the directors and the circumstances surrounding that insolvency. Thirdly, as we engage in this work, our immediate priority is to ensure that affected workers at the Prax Lindsey refinery are supported through this difficult time. The Government believe that the business's leadership has a responsibility to the workers and the local community. We call on it to do the right thing and provide support to the workers through this difficult period. The wealthy owner cannot wash his hands of his obligations to the workers and their families. That is why we call on him to put his hands in his pockets and deliver proper compensation for the workers. The Government will now urgently work with the company and trade unions to explore what further support can be offered to the workforce, including the maximum possible help to ensure that workers can pursue new job opportunities if the refinery cannot be sold. Fourthly, we are committed more widely to securing the long-term future of the UK's refinery sector. It is important to say that the UK has a refining sector with a number of well-run operators. I met the refining sector earlier this month for a ministerial roundtable, and it told me that it had not had such a meeting with Government for 13 years. The reality is that the previous Government left the UK's refining sector facing significant long-term challenges. We know that there are global challenges too, including competition from larger refining operations in the middle east, India and Africa. We have already seen the effects of years of negligence from previous Governments, and this Government have been left to pick up the pieces. The UK Government are determined to work with industry, workers and trade unions to ensure that we safeguard our refineries for the future. That is why we are reviewing the methodology for the energy-intensive industries compensation scheme that we inherited from the last Government. The refineries sector is not covered by that scheme, and the review will help assess whether sectors such as this should be covered in the future, and whether more can be done to help their competitiveness. That is not all: in less than 12 months in office, we have invested in carbon capture, usage and storage, which can help key refineries, such as Phillips 66 and Stanlow, through Viking and HyNet. We have funded Project Willow at Grangemouth--a project that can help all refineries meet future challenges--and we are driving forward with the sustainable aviation fuel mandate, to help the refining sector maximise the opportunities created by the clean energy revolution. From the moment we were informed of these issues, the Government have been focused on securing the future of the Prax Lindsey oil refinery site and supporting its workers. Today, those workers have been badly let down by the company, but we are committed to supporting them and the wider community during this difficult time. The Government are absolutely committed to a long-term future for the UK's refinery sector, and over the weeks and months ahead, we will provide further updates on the steps I have set out in this statement. I commend this statement to the House."
"Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, on June 20, 1975, the legendary Gilles Vigneault performed his song, Gens du pays , for the very first time on Mount Royal in Montreal. On stage, three Quebec music greats, Gilles Vigneault, Louise Forestier, and Yvon Deschamps, sang the now-famous lyrics that ring out during our national holiday celebrations as well on as birthdays. Gens du pays is one of the greatest gifts to francophone song. It is a classic, an anthem for Quebeckers. It is a testimony to our collective memory. This year, our national holiday will give us an opportunity to pay tribute to this iconic song. The singer from Natashquan will be proud to hear his words, which unite us and bring us together, being sung throughout Quebec. I would like to thank Mr. Vigneault for leaving such a lasting impression on our culture. I wish everyone a happy national holiday."
"Mr. Speaker, my colleague asked me that question because I am often focused on this country's economy. The number that the PBO came up with is about $20.4 million per year in additional administration costs to get this program across, if it is approved in this way. That escalates going forward, of course, and that means more cost to Canadians. We can think about that as it continues down, with children upon children upon children. Eventually, we are going to have to deal with this, and the sooner the better."
"As a Member of Parliament, I am always delighted to come to work to talk about policies such as this, which will lift 100,000 children out of poverty and give 4,500 children in my constituency access to free school meals. As a parent, I know how much of a difference this will make to the lives of parents in my constituency. Does the Minister agree that policies that give any child, wherever they are born and whatever their background, the chance to fulfil their potential are exactly what a Labour Government should be doing?"
"The economics of the Green party are even more fantastical than the economics of the Conservatives and Reform; we all dread to think what things might be like under that party. We see that in the local council in my city of Bristol, and it is an absolute disaster. If the council could just get on with building council houses and social homes, it would help more people to live a better life, and would aid prevention. We are getting on with tackling social care. That was announced in the spending review, and that is what the Casey review will do."
"Israel must immediately allow rapid and unhindered aid into Gaza. The Foreign Secretary raised the humanitarian situation with Israeli Foreign Minister Sa'ar on Sunday. We recently announced PS4 million of further UK humanitarian support for Gazans, and we will continue to urge Israel to lift restrictions on humanitarian aid to allow the UN and other aid organisations to operate safely and independently."
The hon. member for Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan.
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the gentlewoman from Missouri for all of her work chairing the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, but, particularly, for the hearings that we have had on this bill. I look forward to working with her on this subcommittee for many years to come. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3394, the Fair Investment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act, offered by my friend and Financial Services Committee chair, French Hill. This bill is the first step in what I hope will be an effort to reform the definition of ``accredited investor.'' This bill moves us to add to that definition by noting that certain experience, licenses, and education can, indeed, make one an accredited investor. At the same time, I will point out that our definition of ``accredited investor'' was, I think, wrongfully decided that we should just focus on whoever is rich, then defined people as rich based on 1983 numbers. While $1 million may have made you rich then, Mr. Speaker, it does not mean that you are rich today. I rise in support of this bill. The accredited investor framework has long protected the general public from investing in high-risk, illiquid private securities. Unlike our public capital markets, in the private capital markets, companies don't provide anywhere near the same financial and other disclosures to investors. There are not the same legal protections for investors either, nor is there the same ability of the SEC or the State securities regulators to police these markets. When the accredited investor framework was first being debated, accredited investors were thought to be those who possess an intimate understanding and knowledge of the risks inherent in investing in private securities. These risks include heightened volatility, less transparency, difficulty obtaining accurate pricing, long lockup periods, and limited liquidity. Ultimately, industry argued for a simpler approach, so the SEC adopted the current definition, which is based around income and wealth. Today, to be an accredited investor, the investor must have a net worth, either individually or, with spouse, exceeding $1 million excluding the value of their home, or they must make more than $200,000 a year or $300,000 with a spouse. Those were definitions applicable in 1983 that may not have defined those with the requisite knowledge, but at least defined those who were high-income, high-net worth individuals. Of course, certain professional certifications or designations such as being an investment adviser could also qualify a person under the existing rules. The wealth and income thresholds, as I have said several times, were set back in 1983. Back then, roughly 2 percent of all Americans were considered accredited investors. As of 2023, that number had risen to 20 percent. Clearly either the standard was wrong in 1983 or it is wrong now, because it is an entirely different level of real wealth and real income. Mr. Hill's bill aims to return back to the original concept of accredited investor, which is that investors in private offerings should be fully aware and knowledgeable of the risks involved. As my friend and ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, Ms. Waters, has said during our markup of this bill:  Just because you have $1 million doesn't mean you understand the complexities of the private markets. On the other hand, you shouldn't be prohibited from investing in products if you have full knowledge of the risks involved but don't happen to have $1 million.  I would add to that that our definition of ``accredited investors,'' when we are done improving it, and this bill is an important step toward improving it, should focus on what percentage of net worth a person is investing in the particular private offering or private offerings in general. That is because one may be accredited to invest 5 or 10 percent of their net worth, but when you start betting the mortgage payments on one private investment, Mr. Speaker, then that is where our definition of ``accredited investor'' should protect you from that. So there should be diversification and limitation on the amount that an accredited investor can invest in any one or in all private offerings. Nonetheless, that is for a different bill. This bill simply makes one important improvement in our definition of ``accredited investor.'' It is critical for the SEC to revise and update the accredited investor definition to protect those who don't possess the proper knowledge or information about the risks of private unregistered securities. Mr. Hill's bill moves us in the right direction by indicating that certain credentials, such as someone with a master's in business administration, an MBA, or a FINRA certification, for example, should be deemed accredited without needing to meet income or wealth requirements. It alsoreconfirms Congress' mandate to the SEC that it must adjust the wealth and income thresholds to account for inflation. This is the right balance. I look forward to passing this bill, and I look forward to our subcommittee and the full committee making other changes in the definition of ``accredited investor.'' Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time."
"I was in the Chamber to hear the hon. Member's question. Obviously we are led by clinical advice when it comes to decisions on screening programmes, but I understand the case she makes. I would be delighted to ensure that she gets a meeting with the relevant Minister."
Will the hon. Member give way?
"As soon as we have legislative proposals on AI, we will introduce them to the House and let the right hon. Member know in the usual way."
"Mr. Speaker, allow me, first of all, as we start to debate on the bill, to take a moment to thank again the stakeholders across the country, including Don Chapman, who is the head of the lost Canadian website and who has been a tireless advocate for this. Let me also clarify the record. I look forward to the committee study on this, but the majority of lost Canadian cases were remedied by the legislative amendments that were implemented in 2009 and 2015, with approximately 20,000 people at the time acquiring citizenship. We know from history that not everyone is going to apply through this. We are here again to right a wrong. There is a constitutional issue in front of us, leaving us with no choice but to enact legislation."
"Mr. Speaker, what is in the national interest is creating and protecting jobs. That is the question that people in every Bloc Québécois riding and every riding here are asking themselves: Who can deliver the goods? Only one party can, and that is the Liberal Party. Only one government can protect and create jobs, and that is the Liberal government. We will get there by working with the Government of Quebec, of course, and by working with all the provinces. In this tariff war, it is essential to refute the White House's rhetoric and create jobs at the same time."
"Personally, I disagree with my hon. Friend, because I think Stoke has a great airport--it is in my constituency, and it is called Manchester airport. I can assure the House that I am not going to take any lessons on date nights from the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Luke Taylor). [Laughter.] But it is great to hear his expertise in this area. We do value that expertise in the House and I hope he makes the Public Bill Committee. He mentions ZeroAvia, which I worked with in opposition and in government, and how well it is doing with zero emission flights. He may have to run that equation past me again--I did not pick it up the first time. What a doughty champion for Doncaster Sheffield airport my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster Central (Sally Jameson) is. It was great to hear the Chancellor mention it in her statement today. I am glad that the hon. Member for Moray West, Nairn and Strathspey (Graham Leadbitter), the transport spokesman for the SNP, welcomes the Bill. It is really good to see how the military and our armed services are getting in on the decarbonisation agenda. The RAF Lossiemouth, in his patch, is showing good practice. My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk (Euan Stainbank) talked with passion about Grangemouth near his constituency. In direct answer to his question, we have no plans to review the HEFA cap. This is about security in a fragile geopolitical situation and also about competitiveness. I remind him and my hon. Friend the Member for Alloa and Grangemouth (Brian Leishman) that the Government are considering EY's report and recommendations regarding the refinery. The national wealth fund stands ready, and we encourage investors to come forward and secure the long-term future at Grangemouth. My hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Lillian Jones) is right. This industry produces well-paid, unionised jobs often in industrial areas that have been deindustrialised. I thank her for her work chairing the APPG for the wood panel industry, and I am happy to accept her offer to speak to it. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich North (Alice Macdonald) is another doughty campaigner for Norwich airport and its sustainable aviation hub. She is pushing that so hard. I was glad to meet her recently and I hope to visit Norwich in the near future. She talked about the jobs and apprenticeships that go with it. My hon. Friend the Member for Alloa and Grangemouth --I will refine my remarks on Jim Ratcliffe; as a Manchester City fan, I had better be careful that I do not say anything out of turn--is right to talk about deindustrialisation. I saw that in east Manchester growing up in the '70s, with the chemical and the mining industries. We are only now getting over that in parts of our great city. I just remind him that if we do this right, we are looking at 15,000 jobs and PS5 billion to the economy by 2050. I once tried a joke in the House and Mr Speaker said, ""Don't give up the day job."" I remind my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Chris Vince) of that advice. At every opportunity, he raises the work he does with Stansted airport. He ended his speech really strongly, saying that the country should be ambitious in this field. I completely concur. My hon. Friend the Member for North West Leicestershire (Amanda Hack) talked about her love affair with East Midlands airport and how important it is to freight. I have had roundtables with the freight industry on how we grow our freight industry in the UK. If I can get to her airport's 60th birthday celebrations, I will. I wondered where my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline and Dollar (Graeme Downie) was going with that police story. And then we got into a very geeky arms race with the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Max Wilkinson). He is right to say that aviation, while a small emitter now, becomes a much larger emitter, or the largest, by 2040. That is why it is imperative that we do this now--another call to arms to go faster. I think my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland (Luke Myer) said he was a supporter of the airport near his constituency. Alfana, Arcadia, Iogen and a plethora of companies could bid for contracts in the region and support a manufacturing renaissance. Just to remind him about carbon capture, which he mentioned, the Prime Minister recently announced PS22 billion of Government money to research carbon capture and technology at Stanlow. In the arms race for who loves their airport most, my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton North (Chris McDonald) talked about hydrogen, wind, solar and clean energy. Reform Members are not present, which is key because--[Interruption.] Oh, they are here now. Reform promises that it is going to re-industrialise these areas, but without a financial plan that adds up. This Government are actually getting on with it, and we will continue to get on with it. This Government have demonstrated that we are committed to supporting our world-class aviation sector through what we have done in the first short few months of this Government. We have the third biggest aviation market on the planet, which is world class and competitive, and we want it to remain that way. We want more people to be able to fly, and we want them to do it sustainably, and that is why the transition to SAF is not a mere aspiration, but an imperative. I recognise that there will be challenges, but SAF will have our unwavering support, which is why we are backing it in the Bill, and I am grateful for the support around this Chamber today. The revenue certainty mechanism will help new SAF plants to get off the ground, supporting good, green jobs in places like Teesside. Our SAF policies are helping to create the right environment for companies like Exolum, based in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Chester North and Neston (Samantha Dixon), which pipes the sustainable fuel to Heathrow, Gatwick and, of course, the UK's fastest-growing airport, Manchester. The Bill is delivering on our growth and clean energy missions and on our manifesto commitment to secure the aviation industry's long-term future through promoting SAF. I urge this House to give the Bill its full support, and I stand ready to work with Members across this House on that. I commend the Bill to the House. Question put and agreed to. Bill accordingly read a Second time."
"I rise to speak to new clauses 102 to 105 in my name. First, I thank the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Alex Davies-Jones) for her engagement on the issues I am about to discuss, and I pay tribute to UK Feminista, which runs the all-party parliamentary group on commercial sexual exploitation, to CEASE--the Centre to End All Sexual Exploitation--and to Barnardo's for its steadfast campaign on tackling violence against women and girls, and the protection of children. My new clauses reflect the recommendations of the very thorough recent review conducted for the Government by Baroness Gabby Bertin into online pornography. I am so proud that this Labour Government have made a commitment to halve violence against women and girls. I truly believe that regulating violent online pornography, which is viewed by nearly 40% of men once a week in the UK, will make a clear impact on that commitment. As the hon. Member for Gosport (Dame Caroline Dinenage) has already powerfully argued, sexual strangulation is one of the most frequently found acts across all categories on mainstream pornography sites. Despite its dangers, it is portrayed as perfectly safe and a normal part of sex. In a Google search, CEASE found 30 million videos immediately for ""choke her"" porn. I want to share the story of Hannah, who met her killer, James Morton, on the day she died. Morton ""was reported as being obsessed with strangulation, frequently watching porn featuring strangulation of women. Although the judge said Morton had strangled Hannah 'without warning or permission', Morton claimed he began to lightly strangle Hannah...before more forcefully strangling her."" Women and girls are paying the price of both an industry that seeks to profit from the most violent kinds of content and laws that are not fit for purpose. Despite the clear evidence of a direct connection between viewing strangulation content in mainstream pornography and undertaking such acts, the law requires the removal of this type of pornographic content only if the threshold  of ""life-threatening"" is clearly met. New clause 102 would ban pornographic content depicting all strangulation and, with the requirement in the Online Safety Act 2023 to remove illegal content, would place a duty on platforms to remove strangulation videos or face sanction. It is clear that we need stronger regulation. Offline, we have been regulating pornographic content since the Video Recordings Act 1984, which specifically prohibits offline content that the British Board of Film Classification would find unsuitable, yet our online regulation has not kept pace. Of particular concern is content that depicts sexual activity with children. Known as ""teen porn"" or ""incest porn"", this content features young-looking performers made to look under age through use of props such as stuffed toys, lollipops and school uniforms. Such content normalises children as objects of sexual desire and drives the demand for child sexual abuse material. Pornography producers have got around the ban on incest material by promoting porn videos in which there is step-incest. In a society where many of us have blended families, it is simply not right that step-daddy/daughter pornography is legal, no matter whether the actor is over 18 or not. New clause 103 would ensure that what is illegal offline is illegal online. We must also ensure that all illegal pornographic content is regulated equally online, regardless of where that content is hosted. Duties under the Online Safety Act to combat illegal content apply only to pornography websites that host user-to-user interactions or user-generated content, and pornography websites that host only commercially produced pornography are exempt from illegal duties. We must not allow that to continue. New clause 104 would ensure that all pornography sites must adhere to illegal content duties. Finally, it is important to remember that the acts of sexual violence I have spoken about today are perpetrated against real women and girls. This is not acting or performing. Women are often forced or coerced into this industry, and, once in it, even the most famous pornography performers are exploited. For example, Kate was trafficked from the UK to the pornography industry in America, where she suffered horrendous abuse and was forced to take part in dangerous and degrading sex acts on film. The consequences of what she endured have stayed with her despite her escaping the industry. The truth is, there is no way of knowing whether the women who appear in pornography have given their consent, or whether they are even adults. New clause 105 would ensure that pornography websites accessed from the UK must verify the age and consent of every individual featured on their site and, crucially, enable individuals featured in pornography to withdraw their consent to its publication at any time. I look forward to working with the Government and colleagues across the House to tackle the harmful impacts of this multibillion-pound industry."
"I agree that that will help to revitalise high streets, but the debate this afternoon is about how we assist the people in our communities, mainly the least well off, the disabled and the elderly who simply want a bank to use. As I mentioned, our high streets have been hollowed out, but we can share some community pride--or indeed some community shame--on this issue. We can start a move towards the former by moving much-needed services, like banking hubs, into the hearts of the communities that we all represent. To do so, we need proper regulation of the banks. It should be abundantly clear to anyone who has paid any attention that the banks cannot be allowed to police themselves. The FCA needs proper teeth and the Financial Services and Marketing Act 2023 should be amended to ensure essential face-to-face services are protected alongside access to cash. During the debate on Lords Amendments to the Financial Services and Markets Bill, before it was enacted, the then shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Tulip Siddiq), said: ""I am disappointed that the amendments will do nothing to protect essential face-to-face services. Analysis published by consumer group Which? found that over half of the UK's bank and building society branches have closed since January 2015--a shocking rate of about 54 closures each month--which risks excluding millions of people who rely on in-person services for help with opening new accounts, applying for loans, making or receiving payments, and standing orders.""--[Official Report, 26 June 2023; Vol. 71.] The Labour party is proudly in power, and I am sure that we will address these issues. We are now in government, and it is time to take action. We need to curb the power of the big banks once and for all. We need to start a review into the impact on communities that are losing bank branches. We need to change legislation to ensure that community factors and face-to-face services are considered when a closure is announced. We need to be bold with proposals for banking hubs by directing the funding, which should come from the banks themselves, to create thousands of hubs up and down the UK. It is firmly in the remit of the Government to do just that, and I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to take the cross-party support that we have seen already today and consider the steps to deliver justice to our communities."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. I will take a moment to recognize someone who has made a particular impact on myself and this body, and that is Transportation and Infrastructure Republican Staff Director Jack Ruddy, who is leaving the Hill after 15 years. Jack started out in my office as an intern. He liked it so much he decided to come back as an intern four more times. No matter what we did or how hard we tried, we just could not get rid of him. I am incredibly thankful that he stuck it out because this entire body has benefited from his public service and his expertise. Jack has come a long way from his days as an intern. He went on to serve as my legislative director in my congressional office. For the last 6\1/2\ years, he has been with me at the T&I Committee, first as deputy staff director and, most notably, as staff director, which he led my entire team since 2022. It is uncommon in this Chamber that a staff member makes such a lasting impact, but Jack is a very uncommon staffer. He is a trusted adviser, not only to me but to many members on the Transportation Committee on both sides of the aisle. Over the years, he has played an integral role in shepherding through Congress numerous major legislative priorities to improve America's transportation network and build our infrastructure. This includes: the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 and other important aviation safety legislation; multiple water resources development acts; Coast Guard authorizations; public buildings and Federal office space reforms; and pipeline safety reauthorizations, just to name a few of the things that are out there.  It takes hard work, skill, extensive knowledge, and a deep understanding of the legislative process to get these things across the finish line, and Jack has all of those qualities. It also takes sacrifice, and Jack, his wife, Paige, and their two boys, Joel and Barrett, know that all too well. I thank Jack and his entire family for the sacrifices that they have contributed in more ways than I can describe. Their sacrifices over the last 6\1/2\ years have contributed to the success of the T&I Committee and the House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, I close by saying that anybody who has ever worked with Jack knows that these things are very true: He is fair, he is pragmatic, and he knows how to get the job done. The most important thing that we know is that Jack is a true friend, and I can say that from personal experience. We are all going to miss him, and I wish him the best of luck as he begins his new chapter in life. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"I am sure the authorities have heard what my hon. Friend says. He does a really good job of championing working-class sports, particularly boxing and rugby league, and I know that that they matter greatly to his constituents."
"Mr. Chair, I also appreciate the minister's tone, but members will understand that I only have five minutes, so I would like short answers to my short questions. What was the timeline in 2018 when the government promised a rail bypass?"
"I hope something else we can all agree on is our admiration for the former Labour MP Ann Cryer, who exposed what was going on back in 2003, which was only five years into a 13-year-long Labour Government, and was disgracefully smeared as a racist for doing so. Let us belatedly make an apology to her and thank her for her courage."
"I welcome the announcement, which will help more than 4,000 working-class children in my community. The Minister rightly emphasised that the expansion of free school meals is  both pro-learning and anti-poverty, and we know that the appalling cost of living crisis, which the previous Government left behind, means that so many children are coming into school hungry and not in the best position to learn. Will he set out what else the Government are doing to tackle the poverty that is holding back so many children?"
"I, too, pay tribute to the work of my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth North (Amanda Martin) for championing the people of Gibraltar and their issues and for ensuring that, in coming into Government, we made sure that there could not be an agreement that Gibraltar's representatives were not content with. I should update the House that yesterday I also met the Opposition in Gibraltar, so they were fully informed of what I hoped would become a good outcome today. We will work at pace on the treaty. I cannot give my hon. Friend a timeline because of the technical legal detail that that will involve, but I will seek to update the House in the appropriate way if there are delays."
"Mr. Speaker, a growing number of people in Quebec are in favour of building pipelines. That is understandable. We have had pipelines in Quebec since 1942. In 2012, a pipeline was built between Lévis and Montreal that crosses 26 waterways, including the St. Lawrence River. It is so good and works so well that no one knows about it and no one talks about it. However, we know that building energy projects bolsters Canada's energy and economy. My question is for the Minister of Heritage . Will he say yes to pipeline projects in Quebec and Canada?"
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to support S. 160, the Aerial Firefighting Enhancement Act. This bill will amend the Wildfire Suppression Aircraft Transfer Act of 1996 to allow the Department of Defense to, once again, sell excess aircraft and aircraft parts for wildfire suppression. This will help facilitate the acquisition of excess military aircraft for the aerial wildfire suppression fleet. This lifesaving authority protects our aerial firefighters and brings in revenue from military aircraft that are not needed. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office anticipates this legislation will reduce government spending. Our brave first responders work tirelessly on the front lines, fighting wildfires that continue to get more dangerous every year. This bipartisan, commonsense bill gives these brave men and women access to more equipment that is critical in an emergency. Mr. Speaker, I thank Senators Tim Sheehy and Martin Heinrich for introducing this important legislation which passed the Senate unanimously in April. I also thank Representative   Dan Newhouse for introducing the House companion bill and leading the charge in this Chamber. I encourage my colleagues to once again support S. 160. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"The previous Government left us with one in eight young people out of work, training or education, and with 2.8 million people out of work due to long-term sickness, not only costing the economy billions more but costing people opportunity, hope and dignity, and now the Conservatives cannot even agree a plan among themselves to address that. Does the Minister agree that the Conservative party is in chaos, while this Government are bringing forward sensible plans to give the country a way forward after the mess the Conservatives left it in?"
"I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Mrs. Vernis Marie Miller Jackson of Portsmouth, New Hampshire--a pioneering educator, visionary community leader, and lifelong champion for civil rights, culture, and historical preservation. Born in Waycross, Georgia, Vernis' father, Bishop Clinton Miller, and mother, Lossie Butler Miller Randall, immediately moved their baby daughter to Savannah, Georgia, where she would grow up, attending Florence Street Elementary School and Savannah State College before receiving her degree from the University of New Hampshire. In 1963, Vernis and her husband, Emerald, a sergeant in the United States Air Force, relocated with their two young daughters from Savannah to Pease Air Force Base in Newington, New Hampshire, later moving to Portsmouth, where she would remain for the rest of her life. For 35 of those years, Mrs. Jackson served as a beloved teacher in the Portsmouth School Department, where her dedication to young people left an indelible mark on generations of students. Yet her contributions to our community extended far beyond the classroom. Vernis served on a task force for the Equity in Mathematics Education Leadership Institute, sharing the program citywide with students and parents. She helped charter an African American women's organization, named Kwanza, which provided scholarships for local students. She was also a charter member of The Greater Springfield, Massachusetts Chapter of The Links, Inc., a national women's organization, where she achieved Platinum status. Mrs. Jackson was a member of the Jonquil Garden Club, a lifetime member of the NAACP, the National Education Association, the New Hampshire Retired Teachers Association, the Crossroads Bridge Club, Friends of Portsmouth Library, and the Portsmouth College Women's Club. Vernis was a member of the Portsmouth Athenaeum and served a three-year term at the Currier Museum of Art and Seacoast Leadership Group. Vernis and her beloved husband, Emerald, also served together for 21 years on the board of the Salvation Army. In 2000, she co-founded the Seacoast African American Cultural Center (SAACC), an institution dedicated to celebrating and preserving the contributions of African Americans in the Seacoast region and beyond. Under her leadership as president and later president emeritus, the SAACC blossomed into a vital cultural hub, curating exhibitions, hosting performances and lectures, offering scholarships, and bringing generations together through history and art. Perhaps one of her most enduring legacies is her work at the Portsmouth African Burying Ground Memorial Park. After the discovery of the burial site in 2003, Mrs. Jackson became chair of the African Burying Ground Committee, guiding a multi-year effort to honor those interred in what is now recognized as New England's only known African burying ground dating back to the 1700s. Thanks to her leadership, the memorial park was completed and formally dedicated in 2015--a sacred space that invites reflection, remembrance, and justice. Mrs. Jackson continued her decades-long fight for equity, education, and civil rights, and her tireless work earned her recognition across the state, including as a ``Local Hero'' by New Hampshire Magazine, where she was praised for bridging generations and inspiring others through action and service. She has been recognized as a Paul Harris Fellow, a Granite-Stater of the month, and has been presented with both the Martin Luther King, Jr., ``Living the Dream Award,'' and the ``Spirit of the Prince Hall'' award. She was also a recipient of the City of Portsmouth Mayor's Award for her 11 years of service on the African Burying Grounds Committee. Vernis Marie Miller Jackson passed away in February 2025 at the age of 92. Though she is no longer with us, her legacy lives on through the institutions she built, the lives she shaped, and the history she preserved for future generations. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Vernis Jackson for her extraordinary life of service and leadership. May we carry forwardher example of dignity, compassion, and commitment to justice."
"Mr. Speaker, I am one who oftentimes provides a lot of commentary from this little corner here, but I did appreciate the member's talking through and bringing to light some of the details that should be shared. I would say that constituents in the riding of Waterloo would want to hear them as well. I do hear the concerns and the comments that were raised in the report. I appreciate that this new government has committed to following all the recommendations. The member made a comment in regard to how, oftentimes, a comment is made, yet there is not enough follow-through. That issue really did bring to light a bit more attention, because we have a new Minister of Government Transformation . I hear the two points that people want raised the most. With the member's experience and his background in law, as we are spending more on defence and as we are building one economy in Canada, what advice and guidance can we hear from him so that we can ensure the success—"
"I think the hon. Member is slightly confused. The statement today is about devolved transport funding to mayors for intra-city transport. He is asking me questions on the broader spending in the Department for Transport, which will be announced in the spending review next Wednesday."
"I am not a lawyer, but my hon. Friend has deployed a clear and compelling argument. At the beginning of his remarks, he referenced how amendment 19, to which I am a signatory, commands cross-party support. In advance of anything the Minister may say, is my hon. Friend able to indicate, from conversations he has had with the Home Office and individual Ministers, the Government's response? He seems to be making such a compelling case; it would be helpful if the Government accepted it."
"I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, as expected, my colleagues deviated completely from the task at hand today, and instead, like I said earlier, they wanted to continue these attacks on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. As I have mentioned repeatedly, Medicaid is not cut for those who need it. We are ensuring that American taxpayer dollars are going to help American businesses. The American Entrepreneurs First Act does not prevent people with temporary visas or other legal immigrant statuses from holding jobs at American businesses or from owning their own small businesses. It just says that if you want support from American tax dollars, you need to be an American citizen or a lawful permanent resident. Mr. Speaker, the Save SBA from Sanctuary Cities Act further supports that mission, a mission that the majority of Americans support, to end pro-illegal immigration policies by showing these cities that the SBA is serious and is going to move its offices if sanctuary cities do not start following Federal law.  {time}  1315  Mr. Speaker, we are here to further the great work that is being done by our communities to put a stop to the terrible overdose and substance abuse issues in this country through the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act. I do not believe that there is a person in this Chamber who does not see this as one of the most serious issues facing our Nation today. I support the rule and the underlying legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:  An Amendment to H. Res. 458 Offered By Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts  At the end of the resolution, add the following: Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 2753) to amend the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to provide for a point of order against reconciliation measures that cut benefits for Medicaid or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and for other purposes. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Rules or their rspective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit. Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 2753."
Time has elapsed. We have a point of order from the member for Sherwood Park—Fort Saskatchewan.
"Mr. Speaker, my colleague made an excellent speech. According to Dr. Sylvain Charlebois, a professor at Dalhousie who is among the national leaders in food pricing, Canada's food inflation is the highest in the G7. This is not a global issue; it is a Liberal-made issue. I would ask my colleague what impact Canada having the highest food inflation in the G7 is having on her constituents and the families in Oshawa."
"Why should the House of Commons, and those in the country that we represent, not be entitled to know whether their Government support or regret the American action? Does not equivocation on that issue bring succour to those who we say must be robbed, quite properly, of their nuclear potential?"
"Madam Speaker, I think it is just completely wrong for the Liberal federal government to meddle in a free economy by creating mandates like this to force people. Whether they like it or not, everyone is going to pay if this mandate is followed through with because all vehicles will get more expensive."
"Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise and participate in today's debate, and hopefully make some contributions to the discussion this afternoon. I think we can all agree that on the tail of the last election, where our government presented a fully costed platform to Canadians, we were returned to this side of the House, under new leadership, granted, but it is not as if Canadians had no idea what the plan for the government was. We have been relentlessly pursuing the objectives of that plan by our actions since the House came back, which has been only about 10 or 11 sitting days, and we have made huge strides towards realizing that plan. We should all agree that there is absolutely no value in trying to rush through a budget within a very narrow window. A budget document involves detailed analysis, policy checks and meticulous preparation. It would be challenging to prepare and present a spring budget with the remaining time left in the House calendar. In fact we feel it would be unwise and unfair to Canadians to rush through a major fiscal document in just a few weeks. Rather, the government intends to deliver a fall budget which will outline its fiscal priorities and provide a more detailed financial road map for the country. In the meantime, we have announced plans to support Canadians by boosting affordability and economic growth. It is those plans I am very excited to share a little more about today. Our government is taking immediate action to address the affordability crisis. Key to that plan is bringing down the costs that everyday Canadians experience, allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned paycheque and to spend it where it matters most to them. The government will eliminate the goods and services tax for first-time homebuyers on new homes at or under $1 million and lower the GST for first-time homebuyers on new homes between $1 million and $1.5 million. This tax cut will save Canadians up to $50,000, allowing more young people and families, in my riding of Whitby, for example, to enter the housing market and realize their dream of home ownership. By our eliminating the GST, Canadians will face lower upfront housing costs and keep more money in their pocket. Eliminating the GST will also have a dynamic effect on increasing supply, spurring the construction of new homes across the country in the segments of the housing market where we need more affordable homes built. We are delivering a middle-class tax cut, which I am very excited will provide relief for nearly 22 million Canadians and save dual-income families up to $840 a year. Canadians will start seeing these tax savings on their paycheque as early as July 1, when the rate is reduced. We are also now formalizing the cancellation of the consumer carbon price, which took effect on April 1. With these measures, we are delivering change to cut taxes, bring down costs and put money back in the pockets of Canadians. The measures send a strong and clear message to Canadians that they are and will remain our government's top priority as we build a strong, united economy for all. In addition to the measures I just mentioned, we are dedicated to protecting and strengthening the programs that have already been saving families thousands of dollars every year. First, we are dedicated to protecting and strengthening the child care program that we have introduced across Canada. Today approximately 900,000 children are getting high-quality early learning opportunities, setting them up for lifelong success. In only a few short years, the program has become a core part of Canada's social infrastructure and fabric, and we will not let it be taken away or weakened by Conservatives; we know they would cut the program down if they ever got to this side of the House, just like they would with the Canadian dental care plan. In its first year, the Canadian dental care plan significantly improved access to affordable dental care. More than 3.4 million Canadians were approved to be part of the plan, while 1.7 million have already received care. In my riding of Whitby, I have heard seniors and many other community members, including children under 12, families and parents, tell me how much the dental coverage means to them and their family. In March of this year, the government announced that all remaining eligible Canadians aged 18 to 64 would be able to apply for the plan in May 2025, with coverage starting as early as June 1, 2025. The newly expanded program will cover about eight million Canadians, saving the average person more than $800 per year. As outlined in the Speech from the Throne, our government has a bold and ambitious plan for the future. The key to that plan is bringing down costs so Canadians can keep more of their hard-earned paycheques to spend where it matters most. We will do this while making the best use of our talented public service and new technologies to save money. We remain focused on outcomes for Canadians and making sure they get what they expect from their government. It is time for Canada to have a government focused on maximizing investments that drive growth and delivering results. We plan to balance the operating budget by budget 2028, ensuring responsible fiscal management while making wise, long-term investments to build for Canada's prosperity in the future. A federal budget is a critically important financial and democratic document. That is why budget 2025 must be delivered in a logical sequence that takes both national and international priorities into account. As we all know, there is economic uncertainty on the international stage. As Canada forges a new relationship with the United States based on respect and common interests, it must stay hyperfocused on reinforcing Canada's strength here at home while safeguarding our workers and businesses and defending their interests here and abroad. These discussions are ongoing, and they are vitally important to our shared future. These uncertainties in U.S. trade policies and upcoming international events, such as the NATO summit in June, present broader challenges and opportunities. We want to take time to address defence spending and trade relationships in a more comprehensive fall budget. In conclusion, our government has a strong mandate from the people of Canada to define a new economic and security relationship with the United States, to build a stronger economy, to reduce the cost of living and to keep our communities safe. A comprehensive fall budget will allow our government to deliver a thoughtful, strategic financial plan for Canadians, a plan that is delivered within a timeline that is prudent, well calculated and not rushed, as the Conservatives would have us do."
I do not think I have very much to add on our approach to the conference next week.
"Mr. Speaker, what the minister failed to mention is that thanks to 10 years of Liberal inaction on crime, half of those 18 individuals were out on bail when they were arrested. Thanks to the good work of the Peel Regional Police, half of them were charged with violent crimes like arson and extortion. Incredibly, half of those individuals are already out on the street today. It used to be that in Canada, if someone was charged with extortion, fraud, drive-by shootings or arson, they would go to jail, but thanks to the Liberals' soft-on-crime Bill C-5 and easy bail laws—"
"Mr. Chair, I was looking for the number. How many investment properties does the Minister of Housing own?"
The hon. member.
"Anyone who saw the six-year-old girl fleeing the flaming shelter where her family were killed by an Israeli air strike will carry those horrific images with them forever. These are very dark days. Gaza is a stain on the soul of humanity, and it is a further shame that there is more moral clarity coming from Ms Rachel on YouTube than from many world leaders, who are complicit in silence. The Prime Minister said this week that Britain must be ready for war. I ask: after tens of thousands of deaths, after a generation of Gazans stunted by hunger and trauma, when will it be ready for peace? When will it help to stop this genocide? When will it hold the Israeli Government to account, and when will it recognise the state of Palestine?"
"Madam Speaker, I share the hon. member's concerns. These are the issues that I hear about very often when I speak with residents of Burnaby Central. Whether it is public safety, affordability or building a stronger economy, our government is focused on practical solutions that deliver real, measurable results for Canadians. People expect—"
"Does the Solicitor General understand the frustration, annoyance and anger of many people in the United Kingdom about the fact that we are paying the French authorities many millions of pounds to do what appears--at the moment anyway--to be very little to smash the gangs that we keep being told will be smashed?"
"As we have just heard, it is widely acknowledged that the crisis in social care is a cause of dangerously high occupancy rates in hospitals that lead to the horrors of corridor care, the dreadful ambulance waiting times that we have seen and a knock-on effect on the community. When I was contacted by the family of a terminally ill man in Wem in my constituency last month, I was reminded that not only is care often provided in the wrong place, but it is often not available at all. Will the Government bring forward the timeline for the horribly delayed Casey review to report back, get it done this year and heed Liberal Democrat calls for cross-party talks so that we can agree on a long-term solution for the crisis?"
"I suspect that my hon. Friend would be far better at doing that himself. His speech on Second Reading was a fantastic example of how we explain legislation matters and practice. It is important that we have certainty and consistency in how we measure things and that we have a clear legislative framework for the measurements that underpins all science. He gave us a historical sweep of those issues when he spoke on Second Reading. It is important for me to pass on my gratitude to all those officials who have supported us in the passage of the Bill, as well as the parliamentary staff who have enabled it to come through swiftly and smoothly. It will return to the other place for consideration of the amendments we have made in this place, and I am confident that--in the spirit of constructive scrutiny and co-operation that has characterised its progress so  far--it will continue on its way. This legislation is an important step in strengthening our domestic regulatory regime and ensuring that it is robust, future-facing and fit for purpose in a post-Brexit economy. I look forward to working with colleagues in the other place to ensure that the Bill finally reaches the statute book as swiftly as possible."
"Mr. Chair, what I know is that we must build Canada and Quebec. We will do so in close co-operation with the province and, I hope, with the co-operation of the members from Quebec."
"I cannot give the hon. Lady a commitment at the Dispatch Box today, but I can say that I take those arguments seriously and hear what she has to say. She is speaking up for her area, and they have some great strengths in her part of Lincolnshire."
"It being 10:30 p.m., pursuant to order made on Tuesday, May 27, it is my duty to end the proceedings. The debate in committee of the whole will continue on the next designated day. The committee will rise and I will now leave the chair."
"I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Whitney M. Young Magnet High School and its administrators, teachers, staff, parents, and especially students. Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, located in Chicago, Illinois, is a public, 4-year magnet high school known for its academic excellence and selective enrollment. It offers an accelerated program, called the Academic Center, for seventh and eighth graders. Admission is based on entrance exams, standardized tests, and elementary school grades. The school has a strong focus on developing well-rounded individuals with a variety of performingand fine arts programs alongside academic preparation. The school is comprehensive and excels in athletics, as well. For example, during the 2023-2024 school year, they were city champs in boys' water polo, girls' basketball, girls' golf, girls' softball, and girls' swim and diving. Whitney M. Young Magnet High School was also the State champion in the Academic Decathlon during the last school year. While the school and its students have always been outstanding in the world of academics, this year in 2025, for the first time in the history of the school or any school that I know about in the city of Chicago, 23 of its students achieved a perfect score on the ACT test. Of course, the ACT is widely used in admission decisions and as a predictor of college success. I am certain that, if the business, civil rights, and National Urban League leader, Whitney M. Young, was alive today, he would join with us to congratulate Principal Rickey Harris and the entire Whitney M. Young Magnet High School community, especially the 23 ACT perfect scorers, on this monumental accomplishment. Imagine 23 perfect scorers in one school and in one place. What an accomplishment. What an achievement. I congratulate Whitney Young students, and everybody associated with this great accomplishment."
"As the Secretary of State set out some moments ago, we are introducing the biggest improvement to employment support that the country has known. We will ensure that people receive the help they need to get into work and to stay in work."
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).
"I once again thank my hon. Friend for her kind words and recognise her force of feeling on the question of recognition. As I said earlier, I am sure I will be back in this House and continuing to discuss these issues with her."
"This Government will not give up on Gaza. I can confirm that the Foreign Secretary has raised Gaza in his engagements with the US. I have not forgotten about Gaza, and was speaking to Palestinian counterparts just last night. The situation in Gaza will remain a top priority for this Government."
"I will not, I am afraid. It is the manner and timing of their death about which the patient will make a legal, informed choice, having been thoroughly assessed. As Professor Aneez Esmail has said, ""I cannot think of any death that would be the subject of greater scrutiny in advance of the person dying than an assisted death. The process far exceeds the level of safeguarding that is in place for many of the deaths that are, at present, routinely reviewed by medical examiners and not referred to a coroner."" Of course, anyone can report a death--including an assisted death--to the coroner, or indeed to the police, if they have any concerns that it was not carried out in accordance with the Act, and if any offences have been committed, they will be investigated. Subsection (2) of new clause 15 requires that the medical certificate of cause of death must state the death as an assisted death, but it must also record the illness or disease that caused the person to be terminally ill and enabled them to receive assistance under the Act. This is really important for data collection and monitoring. In jurisdictions with similar legislation, around 70% of patients have some form of cancer, and the new clause would ensure that data is collected, not only in relation to how many people access assisted dying but in relation to the terminal illnesses that make them eligible. I now turn to new clause 20, which relates to the guidance about the operation of the Act, including with respect to devolution. Put simply, new clause 20 ensures that the right rules and responsibilities sit with the right people. First, it places the obligation to issue guidance with the Secretary of State. Secondly, it enables Welsh Ministers to issue guidance on devolved matters. The Secretary of State must consult the chief medical officers in order to have the benefit of their expertise, which is also really important. New clause 20 also adds a provision that ensures that the Secretary of State must consult people with learning disabilities and people with protected characteristics, which include disability, race, religion and belief."
"Mr. Chair, I would like to know if the minister thinks she has any responsibility for the department prior to her time, or is it all just new since she came here?"
"I will not say ""happy birthday"" to you again, Mr Speaker; perhaps we can arrange to sing it next time so that we do not all have to repeat it. The Secretary of State's statement is welcome. The other welcome news today is the Government's commitment to PS460 million of investment at Sheffield Forgemasters. That is primarily for defence nuclear, but it also provides extra capacity for civil nuclear. There is a bit of concern about Rolls-Royce's link with Czechia, so will my right hon. Friend commit to using forgings from Sheffield Forgemasters in the first-of-its-type SMR in this country and build the supply chain so that the vast majority of jobs are provided for British workers?"
"I totally agree. We know that Esther Rantzen and Jonathan Dimbleby want the Bill to be implemented, but our role is to be voices for the voiceless, so I totally agree with her. As opposed to the vague, ever-changing qualifying criteria that are held up as safeguards, at least these amendments would put ethnic minority people on the board: new clause 6 says that if they are on the ward, they should be on the board as well. The Bill seems to have neglected them altogether, so the new clause would provide real protections. We know that in a cost of living crisis, assisted dying could be quite attractive. BAME communities have lower disposable household incomes than standard households, and during a cost of living and housing crisis, it is possible to imagine relatives wanting to speed up granny or grandad's probate--or naani maa or dadima, even--to get a foot on the ladder."
"We have appointed new leadership. We are establishing new governance. We are looking at the incentives contained in the contracts on the civil engineering works. We will make sure that no stone is left unturned in providing value for money for the taxpayer on HS2, because this country is making a very significant investment and we need to ensure that every penny is wisely spent."
"Mr. Speaker, sometimes we are asked what the Bloc Québécois is good for. At the very least, it is good for having members of Parliament who do not steal $814 million from Quebeckers to write cheques for Canadians. Right now, there are 44 Liberal members from Quebec. All 44 of them voted to steal from Quebeckers, as did the 11 Conservatives from Quebec. They all rejected the National Assembly's unanimous motion calling on the government to pay back that money. Clearly, these members do not stand up for Quebeckers. The real question is not what the Bloc Québécois is good for, but what these people are good for."
I must interrupt the hon. member because I must give the parliamentary secretary time to answer the question. The hon. parliamentary secretary.
"Mr. Speaker, perhaps the member was not listening to my speech. I was highly critical of this particular piece of legislation because of its effects on unions and skilled trades and the opportunity for government corruption and graft, which there is a well-documented history of. I am not sure I agree with the member's analysis of the election results, but the voter is always right, and this is where we are. We will continue to attack what I perceive as—"
"Mr. Chair, we will be bringing forward criminal justice reform later in the fall."
"Mr. Speaker, a green and eco-friendly transition is obviously what we should be pursuing. Funding pipelines and oil companies will not achieve that transition. I forgot to say something in my speech. In 2023, the World Bank enumerated 73 carbon pricing mechanisms in 53 countries. That is five more than in 2022, 12 more than in 2021 and 69 more than 20 years ago. At the end of the day, if Canada does this, it will be the first to choose this path. That is not in everyone's interest, because we want to remain competitive internationally and expand into new markets."
"the mistakes we are making in this Congress, bill after bill after bill, will damage this Nation's strength at a time when we need unity and strength more than ever before. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill."
"With this it will be convenient to discuss the following: New clause 42--Alignment of basic and occupier's loss payments-- ""(1) The Land Compensation Act 1973 is amended as follows. (2) In section 33B (occupier's loss payment: agricultural land), in subsection (2)(a) omit '2.5%' and insert '7.5%'. (3) In section 33C (occupier's loss payment: other land), in subsection (2)(a) omit '2.5%' and insert '7.5%'."" This new clause, being an amendment of the Land Compensation Act 1973, would align the occupier's loss payments with the basic loss payments at 7.5% of the value of the party's interest. New clause 85--Compensation payments-- ""(1) The Land Compensation Act 1973 is amended as follows. (2) In section 30 (amount of home loss payment in England and Wales)-- (a) in subsection (1)-- (i) omit '10 per cent of'; (ii) omit 'subject to a maximum of PS15,000 and a minimum of PS1,500.' (b) omit subsections (3) and (4). (3) In section 33A(2) (basic loss payment), omit from 'payment of' to the end of subsection (2) and insert 'the market value of his interest in the dwelling'. (4) In section 33B (occupier's loss payment: agricultural land)-- (a) in subsection (2), omit from 'payment of' to the end of subsection (3) and insert 'the market value of his interest in the dwelling'; (b) omit subsection (3)."" New clause 107--Disposal of land held by public bodies-- ""(1) Section 209 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 (Power to direct bodies to dispose of land) is amended as set out in subsection (2). (2) In subsection (2), at end insert-- '(C1) Steps taken in response to a direction under subsection (A1) must-- (a) include a duty to consider disposal of land for the public good, and (b) provide that the difference between the unrestricted value of the land to be disposed of and the consideration for the disposal does not exceed PS3,000,000 or 40% of unrestricted market value, whichever is greater.' (3) Section 209 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 comes into force at the end of the period of two months beginning with the day on which this Act is passed. (4) The Local Government Act 1972 is amended in accordance with subsections (5) and (6). (5) In section 123 (disposal of land by principal councils), after subsection (2) insert-- '(2ZA) But the Secretary of State must give consent if the disposal is in accordance with subsection (7) of section [Disposal of land held by public bodies] of the Planning and Infrastructure Act 2025.' (6) In section 127(3) (disposal of land held by parishes and communities), after '(2A)' insert ', (2ZA)'. (7) Subject to subsection (9), a disposal of land under is in accordance with this section if it is in accordance with the Local Government Act 1972 General Disposal Consent (England) 2003 published in Department for Communities and Local Government Circular 06/03, as amended by subsection (8). (8) Those amendments to the Local Government Act 1972 General Disposal Consent (England) 2003 are-- (a) in paragraph 2(a)(iii), leave out 'and' and insert, at end-- '(iv) the development and availability of affordable housing, and' (b) in paragraph 2(b), for 'PS2,000,000 (two million pounds)' substitute 'PS3,000,000 (three million pounds) or 40% of the unrestricted market value, whichever is greater'; (c) after paragraph 3(1)(xii) insert-- '(xiii) a combined authority; (xiv) a mayoral combined authority; (xv) the Greater London Authority; (xvi) any successor body established by or under an Act of Parliament to any body listed in this subparagraph.' (9) The Secretary of State may, to reflect inflation, further amend the cash value that the difference between the unrestricted value of the land to be disposed of and the consideration for the disposal must not exceed."" New clause 114--Development corporations to provide green spaces-- ""A development corporation must provide or facilitate the provision of-- (a) green spaces, including private gardens, balconies, and community gardens; (b) the care and maintenance of the green spaces provided for under this section."" This new clause would ensure development corporations include provision for green spaces in new developments. New clause 127--Repeal of section 14A of the Land Compensation Act 1961-- ""In the Land Compensation Act 1961, omit section 14A."" New clause 128--Community benefit scheme for compulsory purchase-- ""(1) Within six months of the passing of this Act, the Secretary of State must by regulations establish a scheme for the purposes of providing members of a local community with certain benefits when a compulsory purchase order has been granted within the relevant area.

This new clause requires the Secretary of State to establish a community benefit scheme in relation to compulsory purchase. The scheme would require the equivalent of 20% of the sum for which a compulsory purchase is made to be paid into a community benefit fund by parties to the compulsory purchase. Amendment 151, in clause 93, page 122, line 2, at end insert-- ""(4) The Secretary of State must, as soon as is practicable after a period of twelve months from the passing of this Act has elapsed, publish a report assessing the impact of this clause on-- (a) the achievement of sustainable development, and (b) the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change."" This amendment would ensure the Secretary of State must publish a report into the success of development corporations in achieving their duty to have regard for sustainable development and climate change. Amendment 68, in clause 104, page 145, line 22, at end insert-- ""(za) after subsection (1) insert-- '(1A) Subsection (2) also applies if an acquiring authority submits a compulsory purchase order in relation to furthering the purposes of delivering housing targets set out in a local plan.'"" This amendment would provide that, where a compulsory purchase order is applied for to acquire land or property for the purpose of delivering housing targets set out in local plans, the prospect of planning permission being granted can be disregarded when calculating compensation (also known as ""hope value""). Amendment 88, page 145, line 22, at end insert-- ""(za) in subsection (2), at end insert 'unless the acquiring authority states that the whole of the land is being acquired for the purpose (or for the main purpose) of  provision of sporting or recreational facilities in which case subsection (5) shall not apply.'"" This amendment would enable hope value to be disregarded in calculating the compulsory purchase value of land, where it is being purchased for recreational facilities. Amendment 89, line 23, at end insert-- ""(ab) in subsection (5), at end insert 'unless the acquiring authority states that the whole of the land is being acquired for the purpose (or for the main purpose) of provision of sporting or recreational facilities in which case this provision shall not apply.'"" This amendment is linked to Amendment 88 above."
"I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Mr. Speaker, there is no cost. There is no cost to this particular bill, and it is necessary. Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that you cannot put a price on the value of life. As a matter of fact, no one should determine a person's quality of life, as far as I am concerned. God bless Charlotte for advocating on behalf of this bill and, of course, my good friends Mrs. Cammack and Mrs. Dingell. We have to get this done. Time is of the essence. Mr. Speaker, it is a responsible thing to do, and I yield back the balance of my time."
Agreed.
"I rise today to honor the 75th anniversary of the Veterans Affairs Fresno Medical Center and their commitment to providing quality health care and services to Central Valley Veterans. The official dedication ceremony for the Fresno Veterans Hospital was held on March 19, 1950. This marked the establishment of VA Central California Health Care System's (VACCHCS) primary facility on an 18.5- acre lot in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley. With the vision to empower veterans through partnership, the hospital partnered with the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Medical School in 1975 to enhance clinical studies and medical training opportunities, this partnership still exists today. Several construction projects were completed from 1981 to 1982 including a new outpatient clinic, 60-bed Geriatric and Extended Care Unit, Milo E. Rowell Auditorium, and Liberty and Education buildings. These new buildings housed numerous new and improved services such as primary care, community development and civic engagement, research and education services, and the Women's Health Program. In 2008, the Women's Health Clinic moved into their new office on the 4th floor where they continue to support the health and dignity of female veterans. Two years later, the Research and Development Department was established to develop VA scientists and innovations to advance health care practices in hospitals across the Nation. The Fresno hospital's mental health services and capacity were greatly expanded through the completion of the Valor, Freedom, and Independence buildings. Physical medicine, rehabilitation, and prosthetics services were also upgraded in this expansion. Most recently, the Community Living Center (CLC) was built, providing 60 additional beds for veterans that require long-term nursing and rehabilitative care. Today, more than 41,000 veterans choose to receive their healthcare from the VA Fresno Medical Center. The biggest contributors to the hospital's sustained success are the staff and volunteers dedicated to improving the lives of veterans and their families. They are the reasons the VA Fresno Medical Center has been a staple of the veteran community and the Central Valley for 75 years and counting. Mr. Speaker, for the past 20 years, I've had the honor of representing the Fresno VA Medical Center in Congress, and it has been a privilege to witness the continued success of the hospital over the years. I proudly invite my esteemed colleagues to join me to celebrate VA Fresno Medical Center's legacy of quality care. May we continue to support their service to Central Valley Veterans."

"As always, civilians are paying the heaviest price: there were 1,195 casualties on 7 October, with at least 74 hostages  since; there have been 55,000 casualties in Gaza; this weekend, 24 Israelis were killed by Iran, and 224 Iranians were killed by Israel. We need to de-escalate this conflict, and quickly. Those 55,000 people in Gaza deserved a future. I understand that the conference to be co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France on the two-state solution has now been delayed. What are we doing to get that back on track, and how will we progress that solution?"
"Mr. Speaker, how many years has the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity been in effect?"
"Mr. Speaker, here is the thing. In the middle of wildfires, where is the Prime Minister ? He is meeting with other premiers around the country to fast-track resource extraction projects, getting rid of environmental assessments and fast-tracking consultations with indigenous peoples. We need a couple of things to happen. We need proper consultation processes with indigenous people. The federal government has been in power for over eight years. It is time for it to stop sitting idly by and put in place the infrastructure necessary to deal with extreme weather events that have become the new normal."
"I should have got out of the way, because my hon. Friend has given a direct rebuttal to what was said by the hon. Member for Hornchurch and Upminster  (Julia Lopez). He is entirely correct in every detail of the important points that he has raised. A Labour Government investing in public services and ending austerity: that is what we will be hearing about in the House on Wednesday, and I look forward to hearing Conservative Members explain how they tried to support that spending while opposing every tax rise that was necessary to make it happen."
"today, I rise to honor a mother and community leader who calls California's 46th District her home. She serves as district director to Senator Tom Umberg where she advocates for 1 million constituents, making sure that their voices are heard in Sacramento. Ana received her bachelor's degree in legal studies from Chapman University and is a graduate of HOPE. Ana is also the mother of Victoria and Cyrus. I was honored to honor her by naming her as one of my 2025 Women of the Year.  Honoring Alicia Garcia"
"My hon. Friend has extensive experience of international coalition building and of taking steps against those who support corruption or who, as in this case, breach human rights. I can confirm that we will work with our friends and allies to try to preserve a path to a two-state solution at the conference next week, in the way that he sets out."
"I am grateful for that question, which raises something mirrored in many parts of this country. The duty to make sure that homes are safe is the responsibility of builders and owners. Where they fall short, there are legal powers for the local authority and for the fire and rescue service to compel them to change. As with all hon. and right hon. colleagues across the House, I would be happy to help, if I can, with any specific examples that the hon. Gentleman has."
"under the economic policies of Donald Trump and Republicans, America is now in decline. For the first time in 3 years, we have negative GDP growth. That means our economy actually shrank this year. It takes a special kind of stupid to take 12 consecutive quarters of positive economic growth and make it go negative. We also know inflation has increased, and Trump Republicans want to make it worse. They want to pass the big, ugly bill that is going to cut off healthcare for over 16 million Americans, all in service of massive tax breaks to billionaires. Tell them to take their heads out of the sand and stop harming the American people. Trump and Republicans should be working for the American people, not for billionaires."
"Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that there is no plan to pay for the $486 billion in spending that the Liberals have asked Parliament to authorize. It is not a plan to have no plan. If there were a plan, they would have presented it. Our GDP is struggling. Our productivity is down. Our purchasing power is crumbling. The unemployment rate is rising, and tariffs are hurting our industries. The purpose of a budget is to bring order to uncertainty, but the Liberal government has done the opposite. By refusing to present a budget this spring, it has deepened the volatility in an already fragile economy. Fiscal credibility is earned by showing the numbers respecting the process that has defined Canada for more than half a century."
"Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, I think that Canadians want us to work together. When it comes to national interest projects, Canadians want us to work together, not sow division. That is what our government will continue to do. As for the legislation related to such projects, I hope that the member—"
"I put on record my thanks to Max, Ken and many others who have done great work representing those who work in this House, whether it is for an MP or as House staff. The role that the trade unions play is absolutely important, and their role in this process should be recognised. Both the House staff and Members' staff trade unions are represented on the ICGS stakeholder group, and the ICGS has an obligation to consult with that stakeholder group before any proposals are brought to the assurance board. I put on record that I hope the ICGS continues to do that very closely, because the trade unions provide an invaluable voice in the operation of the ICGS, and that should continue. The assurance board will scrutinise the day-to-day performance of the ICGS and ensure that investigations are timely and of a high quality. It will also have responsibility for updating the ICGS procedures document, but only that document."
"I cannot believe that I did not hear the Opposition spokesperson welcome our announcement. It is a shame that when the Conservatives were in government tackling child poverty was not considered a priority. I feel a little sorry for the spokesperson, who claims to care about education, given that his only policy is to give private schools a tax break. Indeed, on the Conservatives' watch, child poverty grew to record highs and they wore the increasing numbers in child poverty as a badge of honour. Frankly, that is shameful. This increase in free school meals is fully funded, and that is possible thanks to the difficult decisions that this Government and the Chancellor have had to take to get the economy growing and put the public finances back on a stable footing. I am excited to hear the Chancellor set out more details next week. That is despite the  mess we inherited from the Conservatives. Why has the spokesperson not taken the opportunity today to say   sorry for his Government's shameful record on child poverty? He has nothing to say on education for our country. Unlike them, we will not sit by and watch more children fall into poverty. Unlike them, we are not offering a tax break for private schools. We are delivering positive change for our country. We are giving children back the opportunity to achieve and thrive. With this announcement, we are ensuring that every child, no matter what their background, gets the best start in life. [Interruption.]"
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I strongly oppose H.R. 884, which would repeal a law duly enacted by the District of Columbia because D.C. should be free to govern its own local matters. Republicans claim that Congress has a constitutional duty to legislate on local D.C. matters, but this is historically and legally incorrect. Republicans legislate on local D.C. matters only when they think they can score political points, such as by demonizing immigrants. Where is this passion and work on affordable housing for D.C. residents? Where is this impassioned work on ending gun violence for D.C. residents? They only bring it up to the floor when they think they can score political points, taking away the democratic rights of people here in D.C. and home rule. The Framers expected Congress to establish a local government for D.C., and Congress has established various forms of local government for D.C. since 1802. The Supreme Court has held that Congress may delegate to D.C. legislative authority over local D.C. matters. In 1973, Congress passed the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which gave D.C. an elected chief executive and an elected legislature, the Mayor and the D.C. City Council. The purpose of the Home Rule Act is to ``grant to the inhabitants of the District of Columbia powers of local self- government'' and ``relieve Congress of the burden of legislating upon essentially local District matters.'' H.R. 884 contravenes the purpose of the Home Rule Act. D.C.'s Local Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2022 allows D.C. residents who are not yet U.S. citizens to vote only in local elections--namely, for Mayor, members of the city council, the State Board of Education, attorney general, advisory neighborhood commissioner, and ballot measures. The D.C. law does not allow noncitizens to vote in Federal elections, which is a crime under Federal law. Regardless of your views on the merits of noncitizen voting for local elections, we have to acknowledge that D.C. is not the first nor are they the only jurisdiction in our country to allow this. At various points throughout American history, Congress and 40 States have allowed noncitizens to vote in local, State, and territorial elections, including the home State of the sponsor of this bill. Congress did not prohibit noncitizens from voting in Federal elections until 1996, and today, about 20 municipalities allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. I also want to address very specific concerns that we are hearing from our Republican colleagues. Number one, they are concerned that foreign diplomats might vote in local D.C. elections. We believe, number one, that that is highly unlikely, both because they have to renounce their right to vote in their home country and because D.C. has no authority over Federal matters and has only limited local self- government. In D.C., the penalty for voter fraud includes imprisonment for up to 5 years. To be eligible to vote in D.C., a person must maintain their residency in D.C. for at least 30 days before the election and cannot claim voting residence or the right to vote in any State, territory, or country.  In a letter to Congress, the D.C. Board of Elections made it clear that to vote in a D.C. local election, a foreign diplomat would have to ``effectively renounce their right to vote in their country of origin.'' The board noted that a foreign diplomat would have to ``swear under penalty of law through the D.C. registration application that that person is not claiming voting residence in another country.'' The board also noted that an embassy address could not be used to register to vote since it is considered a commercial or business address and that a foreign passport cannot be used to register to vote since it does not contain a residential address in D.C. While Republicans are concerned about foreign diplomats voting in local elections, I wonder if they are aware that currently in this country, United States citizens who are registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act are currently allowed to vote in elections at all levels of government in the United States, including Federal elections. That is right. Registered foreign agents who are currently U.S. citizens can vote anywhere in the United States. Republicans are also concerned that undocumented immigrants might vote in local D.C. elections. That is highly unlikely because the D.C. voter roll is a public record, and undocumented immigrants likely will not want to identify themselves, including their addresses. In closing, the House of Representatives is considering the wrong D.C. voting rights bill here today. Republicans claim that voting is a core right or privilege of American citizenship. Not only is that historically incorrect, but as I described earlier, it is also hypocritical. Republicans have fought tooth and nail to defeat legislation that would give the American citizens who reside in D.C. voting representation in the House and Senate. We, of course, continue to push for D.C. statehood. Madam Speaker, I urge the House to reject H.R. 884 and, instead, to pass H.R. 51. I reserve the balance of my time."
"Absolute rubbish! The UK and the US are the very closest of defence, intelligence and national security partners. The US was strongly behind the deal we have done on Diego Garcia, because it knows that that deal secures the operational sovereignty there of the UK and the US for the next 100 years and beyond."
"The Minister keeps referring to a loophole in justice. I do not understand why he cannot see that ""innocent until proven guilty"" should apply in these cases, as in any other. The idea that my winning an appeal would not automatically mean I was innocent,  as it does in every other case, seems a breach of a fundamental tenet. He is also not correct to say that the power is used sparingly. Since 2010, dozens of people have been denied citizenship on the say-so of the Home Secretary, despite there being nothing proven in court. That is what is different about these cases. This is effectively something that is done in secret, behind closed doors, without the facts necessarily being proven in any way. I have a lot of respect for the hon. Gentleman, but this is a case in which we should be even more reliant on due process, rather than trying to legislate judges out of the room, as we are trying to today."
"That is important, because people up and down this country still live with the impacts of the pandemic through long covid and mental health challenges. We see that huge impact still today on individuals and the NHS. We must remember how the country came together in the face of unprecedented events, about which we learned more every day. We had to adapt our approach to that changing knowledge. I am grateful to all Members from all parts of this Chamber for what they did. A few Members in the Chamber were in the House at the time, and they will remember the work of Jon Ashworth, which I recognise in particular. He was in this place at that time, and I remember his cross-party approach to so much that was done. I pay tribute to the emergency services, to councillors and to the people of this country, particularly those who worked in health and social care and those who lost someone. It was a traumatic time for the whole country. There are lessons that must be learned about planning for future pandemics and supporting those with long covid. The hon. Member for Honiton and Sidmouth (Richard Foord) was right--like so many, I have constituents who lost loved ones and family members who were affected by the vaccine, as has been recognised by a coroner. They have been dignified and courteous, but they call for the Government to review the vaccine damage payment scheme. I hope that the Minister will take that suggestion in the spirit in which it is intended. We owe it to this country to make sure that we are better prepared for any future pandemic. We owe it to those who lost loved ones and those who suffered in so many different ways: those with long covid, those with mental ill health, kids who were unable to attend school, domestic abuse sufferers and those who still suffer today. It is right that we remember, reflect and debate, as we do now, in order to learn. As a former Health Minister, I have memories that continue to surface. We will all of us live with our memories of that time till the end of our days. The least we can do is to ensure that this House and this country always remember and reflect carefully on what we can do better next time."
"The review describes responsibility for space policy within Government as ""fragmented"", so its proposal for a ""reinvigorated Cabinet sub-Committee"" to set the strategic approach to space is to be welcomed. That will clearly have significant implications for the development of a vertical-launch satellite facility at SaxaVord spaceport in Shetland. Will the Secretary of State ensure that hardwired into that Sub-Committee is a process of engagement for the operators at SaxaVord and the communities that host them, so that both might be empowered to deliver on this most important strategic objective for the country as a whole?"
Does my hon. Friend agree that the electrification of railway lines boosts capacity and enables them to ship more freight across our great nation?
"Mr. Speaker, I want to start by saying that I will be sharing my time with the member for Spadina—Harbourfront . I acknowledge that we are gathered on the traditional unceded territory of the Anishinabe Algonquin people. I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C‑3 and the transformative power of Canadian citizenship. Fundamentally, this bill is about people, real families, as well as their history, their sacrifices and their deep and lasting ties with Canada, regardless of where their careers or lives take them. I am an example of this myself. My two children were born in New York when I was completing my master's degree. Although they have lived in Canada for most of their lives and my ancestors settled in Batiscan, near Trois‑Rivières, in the 17th century, the law enacted by Stephen Harper's Conservative government could prevent my grandchildren from holding Canadian citizenship or require them to undergo security screening to ensure that they are entitled to citizenship should they decide to study or work in another country at some point in their lives. What the Conservative government did affects the choices of people who wish to study or work abroad because, if they do that, their children might not get Canadian citizenship. Citizenship is a legal status, but more than that, it is about belonging to a diverse, welcoming community bound by shared democratic values. In today's world, where migration and mobility are facts of life, Canada has a chance to lead by example. While some countries restrict access to citizenship, Canada is taking a more principled approach with this bill, an approach that encompasses diversity, cross-border families and the lasting ties that Canadians have with other countries. Many Canadians live and work abroad. There are Canadian expat communities in big cities all over the world. These expats work in a variety of fields, including international development, the arts, science, education, global trade and humanitarian work. These citizens have deep ties to Canada. They often move back here to raise children, take care of loved ones and build new communities. Taking action to make sure that their children can share this identity, even if they were born or adopted abroad, is not simply a matter of fairness. It also makes our country more cohesive and influential on the world stage. Today, I want to share what new Canadians told us about why Canadian citizenship is important to them, how becoming a citizen affected them, and what we should do to continue to protect the rights, responsibilities and shared values of citizenship. The act of becoming a Canadian citizen is often described as a very proud moment. As my Conservative colleague mentioned, people are proud to make Canada their home and proud of the journey they took to get here. Becoming a Canadian citizen is the culmination of years of sacrifice, hard work and perseverance, not just for the person themselves, but often for their whole family. It is a moment that connects them to their community. It is also an opportunity to take part in something greater than themselves. Many MPs have had the honour of witnessing the emotional impact of that moment. Newcomers, often accompanied by their children, clutch their certificates tightly, knowing that their family's future is safer in our wonderful country. That feeling of pride goes beyond borders. People around the world hope to get the opportunity to make Canada their home. To those fleeing conflict, persecution and hardship, Canadian citizenship represents a fresh start, a second chance at life. It is a privilege that most do not take lightly. The gratitude expressed by new citizens is profound. People often talk about the opportunities that Canada offers, especially when it comes to education, health care and peace. These pillars of Canadian life are the cornerstones of a better future, not only for new citizens themselves, but also for their children and future generations. Whether through volunteering, participating in local cultural events or simply getting to know their neighbours, new Canadians are actively involved in strengthening the fabric of our society. They embody Canada's spirit of generosity and contribute in many ways to the success of their communities. As a government, we must remain vigilant in ensuring that Canadian citizenship remains a beacon of and a commitment to inclusivity, fairness and security. That is why we have introduced Bill C-3 : to ensure that access to citizenship remains fair and transparent. At a time when disinformation and division, including division here in the House, can threaten confidence in public institutions, Canada must show that its commitment to fairness extends across borders. Providing thoughtful, inclusive pathways to citizenship beyond the first generation affirms that Canadian identity is shaped not only by place of birth, but also by connection, contribution and values. This bill aims to automatically remedy the status of individuals who would have been Canadians were it not for the first-generation limit. It also creates a forward-looking new framework for citizenship by descent. In the future, children born abroad beyond the first generation will be eligible for citizenship if their Canadian parents can demonstrate a substantial connection to Canada. This is important. In the future, as long as the Canadian parent who was born abroad spends a cumulative total of three years in Canada before the birth of their child, their child will also be born a citizen. There is no need to be conducting security screening on babies. The objective and structure of the Citizenship Act have been that children adopted abroad by Canadians and children born abroad to Canadians are treated as similarly as possible, and this will continue to be the case after Bill C‑3 comes into force. The great privilege of Canadian citizenship comes with great responsibility. It is a responsibility to engage, to contribute and to build on the values that make our country what it is. Citizenship is not just a destination. It is a journey and a commitment to community, justice and mutual respect. This is why, once Bill C‑3 is passed, Canadians born outside Canada who adopt children abroad will have to meet the same substantial connection requirement to have access to the direct grant of citizenship for adoptees as they would have to meet to pass on their citizenship if they had a child born abroad. These children, whether adopted abroad or born abroad, will also have to meet the substantial connection requirement to pass on their citizenship if they have or adopt children abroad in the future. In conclusion, obtaining Canadian citizenship is an important and emotional step. It is a privilege that entails opportunity and gratitude, as well as a responsibility to stay true to the values that unite us. Citizenship is not simply a legal matter. It is a reflection of who we are and who we include. By passing Bill C‑3, we will be choosing connection over exclusion, equity over limitation. We will be telling Canadians around the world and their children that their connection to our country is important and that their stories, contributions and sense of belonging are part of what makes Canada strong."
"Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has given notice of a gag order on Bill C‑5 . The House has been sitting for just three weeks, and he already wants to ram through a bill, and not just any bill. Bill C‑5 gives him the power to rule by decree on fossil fuel projects. Bill C-5 completely guts environmental assessments. Bill C‑5 threatens Quebec's jurisdiction and the rights of indigenous peoples. It makes no sense to let it go through without debate, studies or hearing from witnesses. Will the Prime Minister let Parliament do its job?"
"Mr. Speaker, is the finance minister saying that Canada's AAA credit rating is safe?"
"Rail services are important in Cumbria, but they are also important in Sleaford. For some time, I have been campaigning for lifts at Sleaford railway station for those who have difficulty with stairs. I was pleased when the previous Government included Sleaford in the Access for All scheme, and having raised it at previous Transport questions, I was delighted when the Rail Minister wrote to me to confirm that the feasibility studies will go ahead. When I met Network Rail yesterday, I found that it is stuck. Network Rail has done as much as it can, but the money ready for it has not been officially unlocked. Could the Secretary of State look into that and ensure that the work goes ahead as soon as possible so that people can access the second platform even if they have trouble with stairs?"
The chief government whip is rising on a point of order.
"I agree with my hon. Friend. We have agreed to implement all the recommendations from the two-year inquiry into child sexual exploitation conducted as part of the Professor Alexis Jay review. We are taking forward one of those--on aggravated sentencing for grooming offences--as part of the Crime and Policing Bill. We are also introducing similar, parallel arrangements for online abuse because we must ensure that we are also taking action on online grooming, which has escalated and accelerated since Professor Jay's work."
"That sounds similar to the Otter Trail in my patch, which would link Feniton to King's School at Ottery St Mary. Does my hon. Friend agree that these new active travel paths will enable young people to get to school safely?"
"Madam Speaker, it is a real pleasure to rise today to deliver my first speech in the House of Commons. I was reflecting while debate was going on earlier, and it is such an incredible honour to be in this place on behalf of the great people of Brandon and Westman. Members do not get here alone. I would be remiss if I did not start by thanking, of course, my partner Ashley, who has agreed to come along on this wild political journey. She has been a trooper in making the leap into federal politics with me, so I thank her from the bottom of my heart. I thank my parents, Darryl and Cherilyn. As an only child, I am sure it is a bit of a strange phenomenon for them to see their only child carted off to Ottawa to represent the rural areas of south-western Manitoba. They have been supportive of me through this political journey, so I thank them for being there through thick and thin. I have not always made it easy. I am sure they would reaffirm that, but they have been there with me through it all, so I thank them for that. I thank my in-laws as well, who have allowed a political junkie into their family with open arms. I thank them for their support. Members get here with a team, so I would be remiss if I did not also thank the members of my campaign team. They came together very quickly after my predecessor announced a sudden departure from politics. We garnered very good results. There is no doubt about that. We broadened our voter coalition. We increased the number of Conservative votes that were received in our constituency. I thank them for their hard work, which was done in very quick fashion to get organized to get up and running. I also must thank my predecessor, Larry Maguire. He is a stand-up individual. He has been a great advocate for rural Manitoba, for all of Manitoba and for western Canadian agriculture over his many years in politics. He has been a great friend and mentor to me personally. I thank him for his friendship and mentorship, and I wish him well in his retirement, although I am sure we have not seen the last of him in his involvement in politics across Manitoba and the country. I want to thank the Conservative Party, my Conservative colleagues and our leader, Pierre Poilievre, for supporting me and putting their faith in me in my stepping into Larry's shoes and fulfilling the responsibilities of this role. I do not take that faith lightly, and I plan to work hard on behalf of this team every day. Most importantly, I want to thank the people of Brandon—Souris. It is such a humbling experience to be a member of Parliament and to be their voice here in Ottawa. I am so privileged to be that voice, and I am going to work hard every day to ensure that their issues, their challenges and their experiences are raised here in the House of Commons. When I think about Brandon—Souris or Westman, the first word that comes to mind is “home”. Like any home, sometimes the house needs a bit of work, and that is certainly what we heard at the doors during this campaign. We heard that Westman industries are struggling. Young families are having a hard time paying the bills and buying affordable homes. Crime is up, both in our urban cities and on farmyards. This is not an acceptable state of affairs, and unfortunately, it gets worse. With Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola, and our oil and gas sector being suppressed by failed Liberal government policies, people are being left feeling like there is less hope than there has been in many years. Why are we here? The Liberal government seems focused, or have been focused, on offshore challenges. It is funding farming initiatives in Africa, but there is no support for Canadian agriculture. It is investing in the Asian Infrastructure Bank, building pipelines in Asia, but there has been zero major infrastructure, nation-building projects conducted here on Canadian soil in the last nine and a half years of the Liberals. That is a shame, and Westman residents have had enough. They made it clear with a decisive mandate vote for change in Ottawa. Part of this larger vote coalition was young people, people who have never voted Conservative or who have never voted at all, and they voted Conservative for the first time. They voted in favour of a Conservative plan that offers a very proud and important path forward for this country. Young people in Canada want very simple things. They want to be treated with respect and to be able to get a good job that earns them a good wage that allows them to buy an affordable home and start a family in a safe neighbourhood. These are not complicated requests. However, if anything, the Liberal government of the last nine and a half years has shown us that the Liberal Party's secret party trick is to complicate even the simplest of government tasks. We need to look no further than the Phoenix pay system debacle, where the Liberals could not even figure out how to pay their own civil servants, or the arrive scam issue, which complicated crossing the border with a Canadian passport as a Canadian citizen. These are just some of the smallest examples. I am not even getting into infrastructure, procurement and the other debacles of the last nine and a half years. Young people in this country voted for a common-sense plan, but even more than that, they voted for a plan full of hope. More young people in Canada under 40 voted Conservative than ever before because our plan inspired them with a path forward to a more hopeful future for this country. That is a credit to Pierre Poilievre and those in our leadership team, who have made this Conservative Party younger with a broader vote coalition. That bodes very well for the future of the Conservative Party of Canada. It is a plan to make life more affordable by reducing taxes; reducing government spending; cutting waste; building safer communities; targeting investments in nation-building projects, such as national energy corridors and pipelines; and having a jail, not bail, plan, which would put criminals behind bars and ensure that they remain behind bars to serve time for the crimes they committed to destroy our communities and destroy our families. This is the Conservative plan that young people across the country supported and will support again. To those people who bought into this vision, this path and this campaign of hope, I say this: Do not lose that hope now. We did not get across the finish line, but the team surrounding me is fighting for them. Day in and day out, we are working to implement that agenda from the opposition benches, and we will get some results. Look no further than last night, when the Liberals lost their first vote on their own throne speech, when we amended it to include the adamant statement that there be a financial update this spring, before the House rises, to ensure that there is a fiscal plan to support the challenges that are impacting them and their families. I know things are not good right now, but they can be better. We know they can be. With a lot of hard work, patience, persistence and determination, we can make them better. We can do big things in this country. We can make positive change so that those who come after us have a better country and more opportunity than we had when we were growing up. Without a doubt, this Conservative team, under the leadership of Pierre Poilievre, is the team to get that done. I am ready to get to work, so let us get to it."
"I thank the hon. Member for her opening comments. She knows that we have already taken steps on the carer's allowance, and those steps will continue. As she also knows, the welfare system is failing people. Labour is the party of work, but we are also the party of fairness. That is why our Bill will deliver the largest, permanent, real-terms increase to basic out-of-work support since the 1980s, invest in tailored employment support so people can try work safely, and ensure that those who can never work are properly supported."

"I thank everyone in Paisley who has been working on those practices--it is exactly the kind of innovation we like to see. Under the Conservatives, only one in six employers said they bothered to engage with their local jobcentre, which is exactly what we need to change with our reforms to Jobcentre Plus. I thank everyone in Paisley, but there is much more to do right across the UK."
"Mr. Speaker, the member for Edmonton Riverbend talked a lot about Alberta's economy, how proud he is to represent his riding and how proud he is of the Oilers. Obviously, I wish him all the best in the finals. He also talked about the Albertan economy and the province's entrepreneurial spirit. Does he actually appreciate what the Prime Minister and other Liberals are saying about creating one economy? They are ignoring economic differences between the regions as well as the need to intervene differently in Alberta, Quebec or elsewhere in Ontario. Does he support the idea of one Canadian economy?"
What steps she plans to take to reform the leasehold system
"The hon. Gentleman's story of his saving his local centre rings a bell with me. The Hunter Centre in Haslemere, which had been run by the Alzheimer's Society, looked like it was going to close in 2017, but because of some great work by Anne Downing, it was saved and is now thriving--in fact, I am a patron--so I am sure that this can be done not just in the hon. Gentleman's constituency and in mine, but across the country."
The hon. member for Windsor—Tecumseh—Lakeshore has the floor.
"I congratulate my hon. Friend on having hit the jackpot with the NHS benefiting from what Great British Energy is doing. He makes such an important point here, which is that the net zero agenda is about lower bills. For example, it is about cutting energy bills for frontline services and putting the money back into those services. Who could possibly be against that?"
"I thank the Defence Secretary for the urgent review he has launched, and the Minister for the leadership he is showing. I join Members from across the House in condemning the appalling attack at Brize Norton, which I was privileged to visit earlier this year with the RAF parliamentary scheme. As well as attacking military installations, Palestine Action has launched violent assaults on defence businesses, including in my constituency. As well as rightly holding a review of military base protection, will Defence and Home Office Ministers review what additional security measures and advice--through the MOD, the police and other bodies--our defence manufacturers may need in the coming years as we ramp up defence production?"
"The hon. Member is absolutely right about the point of due process. I can say to him and to my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing Southall that these powers are used very sparingly. Each and every individual case is decided on by the Home Secretary. I know that this Home Secretary has--and I am sure previous Home Secretaries have--taken these responsibilities incredibly seriously. Decisions are made carefully, on advice and in accordance with international law, and I am happy to give the hon. Member and others that assurance."
"Mr. Speaker, in 2017, our current Prime Minister said that most fossil fuel reserves are “unburnable” under any reasonable climate targets. In 2022, he said that transitioning our economies to net zero is an enormous opportunity and that the transition is “capital-intensive” and “job-heavy”, and is what the world needs for the future and right now. Given that growth in solar, 25%, and batteries, 50%, now outpaces fossil growth by a scale of 12 to 1, will the minister reallocate subsidies to match and fast-track critical minerals for batteries?"
"Mr. Speaker, let me congratulate you on your new role; it looks very good on you up there. I have a question for my friend and colleague with respect to our government's bold new agenda. Obviously we were recently re-elected, and I am very pleased to hear our Prime Minister commit to the 2% spending amount with NATO. I am wondering whether my friend could just comment on what that means for the armed forces in our country and what it means for our economy."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of my bill, the American Cargo for American Ships Act, and to express my thanks for the bipartisan leadership of Chair Sam Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and also Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee Chair Ezell, who cosponsored this important legislation. My bill strengthens the American merchant marine by guaranteeing that 100 percent of U.S. cargo generated by the Department of Transportation will be transported on U.S.-flagged ships. It is that simple. This bill is the maritime industry's version of Buy American. If the government is shipping cargo, it should be on American vessels. Starting with the end of World War II, the U.S. merchant marine has shrunk to an unacceptable level. My bill is an actionable step that we can take right now to improve the maritime industry, grow the U.S. mariner pool, and increase the number of U.S.-flagged ships. From a national security perspective, cargo preference remains an effective shipping strategy in maintaining our Nation's presence and economic viability in the international market. As the Department of Transportation is responsible for overseeing the majority of American maritime shipping, both domestically and globally, there is no reason why the Department cannot and should not set an example that is meaningful. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 2035, the American Cargo for American Ships Act, and I yield back the balance of my time."
"Beckie Ramsay is my constituent, and it was her son Dylan who drowned in that abandoned quarry. He will never be forgotten. The loss that she suffered, and that others have suffered, as has been mentioned today--none of us can imagine what they went through. I just want to say that Beckie does a great job of going into schools, educating and saving lives for others."
"The question is on Motion No. 2. If a member participating in person wishes that the motion be carried or carried on division, or if a member of a recognized party participating in person wishes to request a recorded division, I would invite them to rise and indicate it to the Chair."
"I rise today to recognize and honor the outstanding contributions of Ms. Ariana Leon, a compassionate leader, dedicated coach, and tireless advocate for authentic leadership. As a CongressionalExcellence Partner, Ariana has played a vital role in developing the leadership capacity of Members and teams here in the U.S. House of Representatives. Her guidance has helped create cultures grounded in authenticity, resilience, and service. With over 25 years of experience in management, cross-cultural education, and international development, Ariana has helped countless individuals and organizations communicate more effectively, lead more intentionally, and bring clarity and inclusivity to their missions. Her passion for empowering others is matched only by her skill in creating environments where diverse perspectives are not only welcomed but celebrated. Ms. Leon's background includes a Master's in International Affairs, certification as a Co-Active Professional Coach, and recognition from the International Coaching Federation. But beyond her impressive credentials, it is her human touch, her ability to truly listen, connect, and guide, that sets her apart. I want to express my deepest gratitude to Ariana Leon for her service as a leadership coach. Her work has made a lasting impact on me and the people she has coached and the institutions she has strengthened, including in this very Congress. I thank Ariana, for reminding us that leadership is about presence, coinage, and compassion. She inspires all who strive to lead with compassion and purpose. From the bottom of my heart, I thank her."
"Madam Speaker, I have a point of order. I would like to know what time the Adjournment Proceedings will be occurring today."
"Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the deputy House leader sharing such good comments today. I know that the member opposite did stand up on relevance, but I do believe that Bill C-4 is very relevant to this conversation. In the riding of Waterloo, constituents want to be reassured that the government will continue to fight climate change, because we know that climate change is real. As I said yesterday, all members in the House seem to believe it, except for the official opposition, for whom I guess the jury is still out. They have not seen that the environment is changing and that we need to do something about it. I would ask the member to share, because we both come from southwest Ontario, the benefits of ensuring that we take the environment seriously. Are the benefits to climate change and economic policy ensuring economic drivers or jobs for tomorrow?"
"Mr. Chair, Canadians have confidence in this new government. That is why they elected this new government. That is why they rejected your leader."
"Happy birthday, Mr Speaker. Today's brilliant announcement backing Rolls-Royce to deliver small modular reactors creates more skilled jobs while also delivering clean, secure energy that does not rely on fossil fuels, even when the sun does not shine and the wind does not blow. Does the Minister agree that the decision shows British business, supported by this Government, again leading the way?"
"Every medical college has retained a neutral position. By my count--[Interruption.] I will go on. By my count, two or three medical colleges have said expressly that they welcome specific amendments to the Bill, and all MPs will have received the letter from senior psychiatrists, who include a former president of the college, who said: ""We believe the draft legislation is workable, safe and compassionate."" A number of safeguards have been included in the Bill. Does the right hon. Gentleman recognise that additional safeguards have been included and have been welcomed by various royal colleges?"
I join my hon. Friend in wishing the group good luck with the award ceremony and their visit to Parliament next week. We want to see many more young people enjoy the creative industries. That is why our curriculum review is happening at the moment: it is vital that young people get involved.
"I was unable to vote today. Had I been present, I would have voted NAY on Roll Call No. 183."
"Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Windsor West . One of our primary duties as members of His Majesty's loyal opposition is to hold the federal government to account. Although the new Prime Minister wishes to reset the clock as if this were a new Liberal government, the reality is the team around him is made up of the same old scandal-plagued, tired Liberals, who are carry-overs from the previous era of Liberal incompetence. Canada continues to face several challenges. There is a housing crisis, there is a crime crisis, there is a fentanyl crisis, there is a federal spending and debt crisis, and there are many more. Today Conservatives are here to speak about how the government wastefully spent taxpayer money on a project for which it did not even confirm if the work was completed. Those are not our words. That is the recent finding of the Auditor General when it came to the federal contracting of ArriveCAN, which inspired this headline in The Globe and Mail on June 10: “ArriveCan's main contractor GCStrategies paid without ensuring work was done”. Although ArriveCAN was a Trudeau-era creation, its fallout is now the current Liberal government's problem. That is why I am here this afternoon. It is to take part in speaking to our common-sense Conservative motion, which states: That, given that the Auditor General found that ArriveCAN contractor, GCStrategies Inc., was paid $64 million from the Liberal government, and in many cases, there was no proof that any work was completed, the House call on the government to: (a) get taxpayers their money back, within 100 days of the adoption of this motion; and (b) impose a lifetime contracting ban on GCStrategies Inc., any of its subsidiaries, its founders Kristian Firth and Darren Anthony, and any other entities with which those individuals are affiliated. Truly, it is the least the Liberal government can do. Let me explain. The impacts of the disastrous ArriveCAN app are still fresh in the minds of my constituents. The city of Niagara Falls and the town of Niagara-on-the-Lake are tourism communities located along the Canada-U.S. border. We are home to three international bridge crossings that span the Niagara River and connect Canada to the U.S. All three are part of the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission. There is the Queenston Lewiston Bridge in Niagara-on-the-Lake and both the Whirlpool Bridge and the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls. Together, these bridges facilitate trade, travel and tourism. They were also on the front lines of the two-year-long ArriveCAN app disaster, from 2020 to 2022. When COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake were among the first and hardest hit by the consequences of restrictive government policies intending to preserve public health by slowing the virus's spread. The ArriveCAN app first launched on April 30, 2020, as a digital tool that was developed in collaboration with the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency. Between November 21, 2020, and September 30, 2022, the mandatory use of ArriveCAN was aimed at ensuring that all travellers to Canada complied with federal travel and border measures relating to COVID-19. In theory, this app was supposed to help limit the spread of the coronavirus, but, in practice, it instantly turned into a disaster. My constituency office was inundated with phone calls and correspondence from constituents and travellers who were experiencing a wide range of issues with the app. Many travellers could not access or use ArriveCAN if they did not have a computer, a cellphone or a data plan. At times, data coverage on the border can be sketchy; travellers can also accidentally incur expensive roaming fees. Language barriers were also a challenge, and seniors felt disproportionately targeted and discriminated against. The app failed on many occasions, when it glitched or faced other software issues. In fact, this is exactly what happened to Bernadette from my riding, a 75-year-old constituent at the time. Upon arriving in Canada from her trip to the U.S., Bernadette was told she would have to be quarantined for 14 days, despite being double-vaccinated and having a booster. Shortly after returning home, she began receiving threatening phone calls from the Government of Canada, harassing her to complete her testing requirements or face jail time and/or a $650,000 fine. Bernadette's case was not the only one. In fact, over 10,000 Canadians were wrongly ordered to quarantine as a result of a glitch in the ArriveCAN app. This glitch created undue and significant emotional stress and impacted people's lives in different ways, whether it was having to give up work shifts, cancel appointments or miss important family events. In addition to the personal impacts that the dysfunctional ArriveCAN app caused people, there is also the economic cost. In March 2023, the international trade committee, which I sat on as a member, published a report on the economic impacts of ArriveCAN. It reads, “The Tourism Industry Association of Canada stated that the mandatory use of ArriveCAN and its requirements had a ‘massive effect’ on Canada’s tourism sector, resulting in ‘a drop of 50% or more in the number of Americans coming into the country.’” Further, the Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Authority characterized the mandatory use of ArriveCAN as a “disincentive” and an “inconvenience” to discretionary travel. We felt these economic impacts in my region of Niagara. As a result of fewer American tourists arriving by auto, the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission experienced a 53% drop in auto crossings in June of 2022, compared to the same month in 2019. In addition to lower volume, travel essentially came to a halt. The report says, “The Customs and Immigration Union compared the country’s land borders to ‘parking lots’”, as the mandatory use of the app at the borders caused processing times for all travellers arriving in Canada to skyrocket. As of June 15, 2022, the Customs and Immigration Union observed that CBSA officers were processing 30 cars per hour at the Canadian port of entry, compared to 60 cars per hour in the years preceding the pandemic. Further, the wait times at the Rainbow Bridge rose from about one half hour during the 2019 Victoria Day weekend to just over two hours during the same weekend in 2022. These delays were felt not only at land borders; airports also experienced the pains and significant bottlenecks. In fact, the National Airlines Council of Canada stated that “following the requirement to use ArriveCAN, processing times for travellers at Canadian ports of entry were ‘about five times as long as they were before ArriveCAN’”. In addition to the direct impacts of the app, there were also concerns being raised about why the federal government mandated the use of ArriveCAN for as long as it did. In the report, testimony provided by McMaster University's Dr. Zain Chagla shows he openly “questioned the continued mandatory use of [ArriveCAN] in spring 2022,” when some public health measures were being lifted in time to welcome the 2022 summer tourism season, which in Niagara is our peak tourism season. Despite the measures' having been lifted, the Liberal government kept the mandatory use of ArriveCAN in place until the fall, when it finally made the app optional in October, 2022. This delayed action was a self-inflicted attack, there can be no other word for it, by the federal Liberals against the Canadian tourism industry, and it delayed any hope for a tourism recovery that year. Although the costs we are discussing today in the motion focus on the GC Strategies contract, the personal and economic costs incurred by Canadians as a result of the broken and dysfunctional ArriveCAN app that was implemented by the reckless and careless Liberals are enormous, perhaps immeasurable, and they are not recoverable. This is why our Conservative motion makes so much common sense. Getting Canadian taxpayers their money back and protecting Canadians from another arrive scam ever happening again by the same company or its founders is the least the Liberal government can do, and that is why I call on all my colleagues in the House to stand in support of the motion."
"moved for leave to introduce Bill C-216, An Act to enact the Protection of Minors in the Digital Age Act and to amend two Acts . Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to introduce a bill that would protect Canadians online while safeguarding their civil liberties. The bill proposes a tightly scoped legislative duty of care for online operators as it pertains to children's online safety, would strengthen mandatory reporting requirements for online child sexual abuse material by Internet providers, would update existing laws to criminalize the non-consensual distribution of intimate images to include deepnudes and would modernize existing laws to provide more protections for victims of online criminal harassment. It avoids the creation and use of ubiquitous and overbroad mechanisms that would impinge on Canadian civil liberties. The bill is a non-partisan plea for the government and all colleagues in this place to abandon previously proposed flawed approaches to this issue and to pass smart measures to protect kids online. (Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed)"
"I whole- heartedly thank the Minister for this much-needed announcement. Up to 5,600 children in my constituency will no doubt be grateful for the relief it brings to their families in easing the financial pressures that many face. Will the Minister confirm that this is just the first step in a wider strategy to tackle child poverty and that areas like Leigh and Atherton will be central to that effort?"
"I have a hearing issue, so if you would like to pick on my ear, please go ahead. Mr. Chair, I have forgotten the question."
"I thank Ranking Member Pallone, this body, and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for recognizing the national security interest of this legislation, H.R. 1737, to direct the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to submit to Congress a report containing an assessment of the value, cost, and feasibility of developing this transatlantic submarine fiber optic cable that has been discussed. Today, hundreds of undersea fiber optic cables connect North America to Europe, South America, and Asia, but not a single cable directly links North America to the African Continent. This represents both a strategic vulnerability and a missed economic opportunity. The diaspora link act represents an opportunity to establish a high- speed, secure telecommunications data connection to Africa from American soil to facilitate deepened economic connections and aid American regional security assistance. This link will allow America to establish a direct digital presence on the African Continent, both to capitalize on emerging economic opportunities and to protect our Nation against cyber and military threats. The study will examine Lagos, Nigeria, and Accra, Ghana, as potential African landing points. Both cities serve as established telecommunications hubs with existing undersea cable infrastructure linking West Africa to Europe and South America. The presence of American embassies in both locations offers critical security benefits for cable operations. Our adversarial nations are rapidly expanding their influence across the African Continent, and a direct American telecommunications link to the continent is a strategic necessity. China has systematically expanded its telecommunications and military presence across Africa. The Chinese multinational Huawei has constructed roughly 70 percent of Africa's information technology infrastructure. China is pursuing the same strategy in the Caribbean, where at least 10 nations have signed Belt and Road agreements that open their nations to Chinese investment and influence.  China's expansion into Africa and the Caribbean makes establishing our own direct telecommunications link to these regions a strategic necessity. Russia, as well, has destabilized Africa through disinformation campaigns and mercenary operations, positioning itself as an alternative to Western partnerships while fueling antidemocratic sentiment. This strategy has made Africa a flash point in the global strategic competition between Russia and the West. Moscow's support for authoritarian governments includes backing multiple coups in Nigeria, Mali, Sudan, Guinea, and Burkina Faso that directly threaten democratic progress. Our adversaries are systematically exploiting Africa's vast mineral wealth while we lack direct access. Russia and China are extracting critical resources across the continent: uranium from Niger, the world's seventh largest producer; gold and lithium from Mali's extensive deposits; cobalt from the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and bauxite and phosphate from Burkina Faso. These materials are essential to technology as well as defense industries. We cannot afford to remain on the sidelines. Additionally, there are many African countries that want to engage with us, that want to do business with us. Burkina Faso and Angola have reached out to our country to engage more, and this is an additional way for us to do that. Additionally, let's look at the populations. Africa has almost a billion individuals under the age of 30. The United States has only 100 million. The entire European Union has 140 million. These young people represent a growing economic as well as potential allyship for the United States, and we all know that social media and internet commerce is the mechanism by which we are able to engage them. An undersea cable linking the American East Coast to Africa via the United States Virgin Islands would create both a critical national security asset and a digital commerce expressway to strengthen America's global political, economic, and military positions. Such undersea cable development would leverage the Virgin Islands' already existing telecommunications infrastructure, which already connects the territory to South America and the mainland in the United States and facilitates additional regional links. The diaspora link act enables the United States to counter Chinese influence and global telecommunications while leveraging our existing strategic assets. The U.S. Virgin Islands not only hosts established cable infrastructure but maintains a National Guard installation on St. Croix with an adjacent military support airport, assets that could directly support and secure these telecommunications operations. The Virgin Islands, the most southern point of the United States, sits at the crossroads of centuries-old transit routes, and we now have a chance to transform this strategic location into a cornerstone of American telecommunications infrastructure. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Energy and Commerce Committee for its unanimous support of this legislation through regular order. This bill passed the House in the 118th Congress with bipartisan support and identical text. I thank my colleague, Congressman Fulcher, for his continued partnership to advance America's telecommunications as well as military and national security. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this critical measure. Congress must protect American security interests in the Caribbean and strengthen our partnership across the Atlantic with our African partners."
I call the Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee.
"The allocation has now been made to the Department for Transport. We have not set out every project that that will fund, but I am sure the Transport Secretary will come to this House or the relevant Select Committee in due course."
"Mr. Speaker, in my opinion, the one thing we can actually prove Stephen Harper built in this country was a whole bunch of division, a whole bunch of groups that were muzzled, scientists who were muzzled. Oh, and he also built what I believe was seven affordable homes during his decade."
"Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to my colleague's speech. We are talking about fiscal responsibility. Our Conservative colleague was right to bring up the fact that we still do not have a budget, even though the government is planning expenditures. The government is likely about to make a significant expenditure. There is talk of building pipelines across Canada. I remember Trans Mountain and the announcement the government made at the time about how it was going to buy and resell the pipeline and make money. As far as I know, that pipeline has not been sold, yet there is talk of building another one. Does my colleague think it would be fiscally responsible for the government to spend money on buying a new pipeline when it has not yet managed to sell the first one and it has not yet tabled a budget?"
"Mr. Speaker, this new government's agenda is to be tough on crime. We are going to make it tougher for violent criminals to get bail and will impose stricter sentences for repeat offenders. The topic of bail keeps coming up. It is the job of provinces to administer the bail system. Right now, the law states that people who are a risk to public safety or are a flight risk should not be given bail. The provinces really need to take a look at what is happening in their courtrooms."
"Madam Speaker, as this is my first opportunity to speak and to rise on a bill before the House in the 45th Parliament, I would like to take the opportunity to express my deepest appreciation for the people of Haldimand—Norfolk for putting their trust in me as their representative for a second term. I am truly inspired by the people of Haldimand—Norfolk, and I am truly honoured to be their voice in Parliament. It is important for Canadians at home to understand the broader context of this bill, Bill C-5 , the one Canadian economy act, which is before the House. Before U.S. President Donald Trump took office, the Liberal government was asleep at the wheel. The sweeping tariffs imposed by Trump and his America first policy and his post-Bretton Woods quest, which seeks to upend the international order, while challenging for Canada, are not the sole cause of the current trade problems we now face. Rather, this disorder has simply uncovered a deep fissure within our nation, which has been caused by a decade of Liberal policies that have left Canada weak and vulnerable. Far from being the maple leaf elbows-up patriots they presented themselves to be, the Liberals have questioned Canada's ethos and have undermined its national sovereignty over the last 10 years. They undermined Canada's sovereignty by diverting billions of taxpayer dollars to green revolution projects through the green slush fund that has been proven to benefit Liberal insiders. They bet against the oil and gas sector by shutting down pipeline projects while favouring the green investments from foreign, autocratic countries with worse environmental records than Canada. The social fabric of our nation and our society was also eroded during the last 10 years of Liberal leadership, creating disunity and making us vulnerable to external threats. It is surprising to see the same Liberal Party that attacked our national identity by changing the names of streets, by tearing down statues of national leaders and by removing national heroes like Terry Fox from our passport turn around and put their elbows up and become the flag-bearers of national pride. We have the third-largest accessible oil reserves on the planet, which we leave untapped. Once it is extracted, it goes almost exclusively to the Americans, who refine it and sell it back to us at a profit. This reality exists because the Liberal government failed to have a vision for future generations of Canadians and instead prioritized its own ideological goals for its own political survival. The Liberal government has blocked the production of ethical oil in Canada and blocked LNG and oil development from going to international markets. We have failed to build our export capacity, and we have nearly become dependent on the U.S. market. As the G7 meets today on Canadian soil, in the beautiful, resource-rich province of Alberta, we, sadly, have the unfortunate status of being the economy with the worst economic growth. The world's economic watchdog, the OECD, forecasts that Canada will experience the slowest growth in real GDP per capita among its member countries between now and 2060. Because of the Trump tariffs and the government's incompetence, workers are losing their jobs. Canadian families are anxious. Communities are shaken. In Haldimand—Norfolk, where I live and in the community I represent, there are thousands of residents who work at the Stelco mill. Stelco is a vital part of our community in terms of jobs, economic activities and business partnerships. Right now, our community is hearing rumours of layoffs, and they are deeply concerned. The Liberal government had 10 years of power. The current Prime Minister was the economic adviser for a large portion of that time. Liberals wasted the opportunity and resources, and they have left Canada vulnerable as a result. Conservatives want nation-building projects. We want to see projects accelerated. That is why Conservatives support the intent of this bill. However, the bill takes only baby steps. I am concerned, and many Canadians are concerned, that the Prime Minister is speaking out of both sides of his mouth. He told premiers that they will have a veto on resource project development and pipelines. The government's environment minister has also been directly questioned on the commitment to build pipelines but could not even utter the word “pipelines”. During the election, we had the Prime Minister engaging in doublespeak, saying one thing to one audience in Alberta and saying something completely different in Quebec, so please forgive us Conservatives if we are a bit skeptical that the government's business is not in pipelines. Actually, the bill is an indictment of the Liberals' own anti-resource law. If we are serious about removing barriers for workers, we need to also give professionals the ability to work across provinces, stop waste and allow international doctors who are qualified to practise rather than driving Ubers. We need access to health care. That is essential, especially in rural communities like Haldimand—Norfolk. We are hearing stories of Canadians waiting for hours in emergency rooms, who are in desperate need of urgent care. More and more we are seeing people dying on wait-lists, unable to get the critical surgeries and treatment they need. Many residents still do not have a family doctor, which means they are not getting timely access to care. I personally had to intervene in one of these situations and speak to the former immigration minister to help a doctor in Caledonia get paperwork sorted out so that thousands of residents would not be without a family doctor, and so that Dr. Marilyn Robertson in Caledonia could be replaced with a competent doctor from abroad. If this had not happened, many residents would have been left without a family doctor. There are an extraordinary number of bureaucratic hurdles that people have to go through in order to practise medicine in Canada. The government has missed the opportunity to introduce the Blue Seal standard and get thousands of qualified doctors and nurses working in Canada through passing a sound and rigorous national test. In conclusion, we, as a nation, have a great and historical opportunity before us. I am full of hope for Canada. We have the potential to be the most prosperous nation on this planet, the freest, the most advanced and the most just nation in the world. That is why Conservatives will always be committed to holding this Liberal government to account and calling for higher standards in service to Canadians. We will support even the small steps to strengthen this nation. Conservatives will keep fighting for a prosperous and sovereign Canada, and we hope the government will do the same."
"I missed a series of votes today. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 183 and YEA on Roll Call No. 184.  Personal Explanation"
"It is incredibly disappointing to find ourselves here to discuss this issue yet again, but this time on the vital matter of national security and defence. There was a remarkably similar urgent question before recess, and it was disappointing then, as it is now, to hear the Leader of the House attempt to justify not bringing major announcements to the Floor of the House first by citing the number of statements the Government have already given to Parliament. The ministerial code is clear: the Government do not get to pick and choose which significant statements they do or do not make to the House; whenever possible, they should be doing it every single time. While I agree with the premise of the question from the shadow Leader of the House, I must say that it is a bit rich given the Conservatives' appalling record of doing exactly the same thing when they were in government. However, that does not let the current Government off the hook. Will the Leader of the House please confirm that the Government will comply with the ministerial code, or shall we expect to do this little dance every week? Surely this time would be better spent making a statement to the House."
I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from the great State of Colorado (Mr. Crank).
"We have all been shocked by these cases; I am sorry to hear about what Liz has suffered. For so many years, those who were gay were not able to be in the armed forces. That they were treated in such appalling ways, getting criminal records and losing the jobs they adored, is truly shocking. I was really pleased that we recently had a debate on these matters on the Floor of the House, but I will absolutely ensure that she and other Members are updated on the delivery of that compensation scheme and of justice for those involved."
"This is obviously a dangerous and perilous time, and we need to do everything we can to bring about a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Can the Foreign Secretary assure us that no British weapons or components are being used to bomb Iran, which could be used as a pretext for saying that Britain is directly involved? What assurances has he had from the Government of Israel that they will not use or even consider using in any way the nuclear weapons that they possess?"
"I regret that I was unable to make the following votes. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 157; NAY on Roll Call No. 158; and YEA on Roll Call No. 159."
"Again, I gently say to the right hon. Member that, under his Government's watch, immigration increased fourfold, until it reached almost a million in a single year. They also created the backlog--400 hotels, which we reduced to just over 200 in our first 12 months in government. One million pounds a day ""spiffed"" up the wall because they were so incompetent. We are building the homes that they failed to deliver over 14 consecutive years of failure. They should apologise while we get on with the job of rebuilding Britain."
"Mr. Chair, under the new Liberal government, we have committed to getting approvals done within two years. That will provide the certainty to have proponents commit capital to get projects done. The Conservatives should be supporting the bill if that is what they are—"
Order. Many members are suggesting words the parliamentary secretary should use. The member has spoken many words; I am sure he can find them. I will let him finish his question and comment.
"If a person is out of work and is offered a job, they are required to accept appropriate work that is offered to them. The focus of our Get Britain Working reforms is to address the current situation whereby nearly 3 million people are out of work sick and not actively looking for work, and 1.7 million people are out of work but are not getting the help they deserve from the existing jobcentre system."
My hon. Friend has been a great advocate for his constituents on this topic and makes a strong case for the scheme. My officials are working with Cumberland council and across Whitehall to refine the business case he refers to. I know the Rail Minister looks forward to meeting him next week to discuss it.
"The banks have more or less abandoned my constituency, and it sounds like that is the case for many others. Some 6,500 branches have closed in recent years, as have more than 200 post offices. There are 23 separate settlements in my constituency with no access to banking. We do have banking hubs. It is an hour each way by bus to get to one, and it costs at least six quid to get there and back. I represent large numbers of people living in poverty, and it is hard for them to raise that kind of money just to have access to banking services. I will make two other points about my constituency and then a general point. The bus services are very poor. As I have just said, it can take an hour each way to get to the banking hub, and the banking hub does not provide all the services that a bank should provide. My other point about my constituency is that there are 15 zones for the internet, and 11 of those 15 zones are among the worst for internet provision in the country. How on earth is someone supposed to access banking on an internet system that is simply not working? It shows the extent to which Britain's infrastructure is creaking, and it is not acceptable that banks should abandon the people who helped to create them in the first place. I will just make this final point about mobility and accessibility. One in four households in my constituency has no access at all to a vehicle. That is more than 20,000 people without a van or a car to get them to a bank, even if a bank were available. It is a disgrace that the banks have turned their backs on all those people who were their loyal customers for so many years. Businesses that rely on cash and collect cash each day have nowhere to deposit it. People are driving home from their place of work or their business with cash in the boot and nowhere safe to put it. That is a dangerous thing. It is odd, ideologically, to hear Members from the party of free enterprise and the free market saying, ""We have to do something about capitalism withdrawing from communities."" That is what is happening, and that  is the nature of capitalism itself. We should just say that the financial sector in this country is worth PS17 trillion, which dwarfs our GDP of PS2.5 trillion. The banks are worth eight times more than the total output of the whole UK. As we have heard elsewhere, PS44 billion of profit has been made by the banks in recent years. It is time we brought the banks to order to serve our communities--"
"Mr. Chair, the answer is that Canada has an AAA credit rating. It is a great position to be in."
"I rise today in opposition to the widely irresponsible legislation that is before us now. Although our colleagues are calling it the Big Beautiful Bill, this bill would instead be a betrayal to our economic future, hard-working Americanfamilies, and some of our most vulnerable seniors, children, and people with disabilities. This bill will blow up our national debt, kick millions of people off of their healthcare, and take food off of families' tables, while cutting food assistance. And for what? What are our colleagues mortgaging our country's future for? What are they slashing healthcare and food assistance to pay for? Well, they are doing it for tax cuts for billionaires. So before my colleagues rush to pass this irresponsible, reckless legislation, let's take a moment to go through exactly how much harm this bill will actually cause and hear from the people in my State who will suffer if this bill becomes law. To start, this bill will blow up the national debt. Since President George Washington gave his Farewell Address, our Nation's leaders have warned against the dangers of accumulating a national debt. Fifteen years ago, ADM Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated:  The most significant threat to our national security is our debt.  The national debt is at an alltime high--$36.2 trillion. And just in the last 16 years, it has tripled. Our annual deficits frequently exceed $1.5 trillion, including a record $3.1 trillion deficit in fiscal year 2020 during the Trump administration.  Unfortunately, these are the first of many grave financial milestones that we face. Within the next decade, our country will spend more on servicing the debt than we do on any other Federal account outside of Social Security. Our fiscal house is basically on fire, but if our Republican colleagues jam through this bill, it is not going to pour water on that fire, it is going to pour gasoline on those flames. Democrats have tried to make efforts to pay down that debt in recent years. In fact, under the Inflation Reduction Act--a law that this bill attempts to actually gut--we reduced the deficit in that bill by nearly $250 billion. In 2023, we passed the bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act, which responsibly addressed the debt ceiling and had the potential to reduce deficits by up to $1.5 trillion. But, unfortunately, the bill before us basically wipes all of that away. I have always said that I am open to making smart cuts to spending, but those cuts should be matched with increases in revenue. Doing so would put us back on a sustainable financial path. Our Republican colleagues are doing the exact opposite. They are making drastic cuts to revenue, and according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the tax provisions in this bill alone would decrease revenues by $4.2 trillion and add--yes, add--$3 trillion to our national debt. This is a recipe for disaster. If we face another emergency like a pandemic or global financial crisis, we will be too hamstrung by our debt to respond effectively. We are on the brink of a financial disaster, and passing this bill could push us over that edge--all so my Republican colleagues can cut taxes for billionaires. At the same time, our Republican colleagues are not making smart, sensible spending cuts to cover the costs of those billionaire tax cuts. Instead, they are gutting healthcare for millions of Americans, including hundreds of thousands of Michiganders. It is reckless, and it is wrong. Medicaid is a lifeline for people in every single community across this country. It ensures that millions of Michiganders and Americans can have access to quality, affordable healthcare. Right now, folks across my home State of Michigan are scared--are scared about what this bill will mean for their families. I have heard from thousands of my constituents from every corner of the State of Michigan on how these cuts are going to hurt them. So today, I just want to tell you, through my constituents' stories, just how detrimental this bill will be for most Americans. Take Isaac from Lansing for example, who says Medicaid is the only lifeline he has to pay for the medicine that literally--literally-- keeps him alive. We have also seen how more and more Michiganders and people all across our Nation have shouldered the burden of serving as a primary caregiver for an aging parent. It is the ultimate gift that we can give to the people who have raised us. But the cost of critical nursing home and assisted living care continues to rise. Medicaid has become an essential way for our aging seniors to pay for the care they need. Take Gwen from Grand Rapids, who says that she wouldn't be able to pay for an assisted living facility for her grandmother without Medicaid. Many of us know someone or maybe even love someone who lives with a disability. Thanks to Medicaid, people with disabilities can get the care that allows them to live healthy and independent lives. That is the case for Wanda from Westland, who takes medication for an eye condition. Without Medicaid, she would not be able to afford her medication, and she could actually go blind. As too many of us know from personal experiences or from friends and loved ones, our country is facing a mental health crisis. Medicaid has become a saving grace for those who desperately need mental healthcare but simply cannot afford it. Take Allen from Fort Gratiot, who says that losing Medicaid would feel like losing the life he has been given back through mental health care through Medicaid. Under this bill, rural communities will be especially impacted by cuts to Medicaid. In some counties in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, there is only one healthcare provider, meaning some Michiganders will have to travel up to 50 miles to get routine or emergency care. Medicaid helps keep these hospitals open. If this bill passes, people in these rural communities are going to be cut off from basic health services. Medicaid also plays an essential role in making sure that children across Michigan get the care they need. I heard from Gladys, a mother from Flint, who says that Medicaid is the only reason her kids can get their asthma medication or have regular health checkups. Expecting mothers also reached out to share their concerns. While she is busy preparing to welcome a newborn baby into the world, Chelsea from Fennville is now afraid that she will lose her access to both pre- and postnatal care under this absolutely disastrous bill. I simply can't understand how my Republican colleagues would leave thousands--thousands--of people across Michigan without the care they need, all so they can give a tax break to billionaires. On top of that, my Republican colleagues are also proposing deep, harmful cuts to food assistance delivered through SNAP. SNAP serves as an absolute lifeline for millions of Americans, including children, seniors, people with disabilities, and working families. So, simply put, if this bill is passed, it will mean people in Michigan and all across our country will go hungry. They will not be able to put food on the table, while billionaires pay less taxes. That is just wrong. But it also makes no economic sense, either. Every dollar in SNAP benefits generates more than $1.50 in economic activities. This supports local grocery stores, farmers all across our country, and the entire food supply chain. So on top of jeopardizing families' ability to put food on the table, to feed their children, these proposed SNAP cuts would also hurt businesses and jobs, particularly in rural America and in low-income areas.  This bill produces the most amount of pain for the least amount of gain of any legislation I can remember in all the years I have had the privilege of serving here in the Senate. I can't believe that we are standing here debating this reckless, irresponsible bill. The harm this bill will do to the American people and to the people in my State of Michigan who are counting on Medicaid for healthcare and on food assistance to help feed their families is absolutely reprehensible. The damage this bill will do to our Nation's economic security is not only reckless, it is unconscionable. This is not what our constituents want us to be focused on. They want us to help make their lives better. But instead of focusing on that, here we are on the brink of passing a bill so irresponsible that it will destroy our country's economic health, harm millions of Americans--all so a handful of billionaires, the wealthiest of thewealthy, can have another tax break. I will never support such a reckless and catastrophic plan. I yield the floor."
"I rise today to honor Juneteenth, a day that holds deep meaning not just for our Nation but especially for the proud people of Galveston, Texas. One hundred sixty years ago, Union troops arrived in Galveston and issued General Order No. 3--delivering long-overdue news: that the enslaved people of Texas were free, in accordance with President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. Though that proclamation had been signed more than two years earlier, it was on June 19, 1865, that the promise of freedom finally reached our shores. Galveston, which I have the honor of representing, is where Juneteenth was born. And I'm proud that our community continues to lead in preserving this history. From the mural that commemorates where General Order No. 3 was read to the many community events held throughout the month of June, Galveston is living proof that remembering our history makes us stronger--not weaker. Not long ago, Juneteenth was not even recognized as a federal holiday. But in a rare moment of unity, Congress came together to pass H.R. 1320. I was honored to cosponsor this legislation and even prouder to see it signed into law on June 17, 2021. It marked the first new federal holiday in nearly four decades--and rightfully so. Juneteenth is a reminder that while freedom may be delayed, it must never be denied. We must always strive to live up to the founding principles of this great country: liberty, justice, and opportunity for all. Let us honor the past, reflect on our progress, and commit to forging a future that preserves liberty--not just in word, but in action."
"I assume that because the Minister cannot find the word ""sorry"" in his vocabulary this afternoon, he expects pensioners in North Dorset and elsewhere to be saying thank you to him for this screeching U-turn. However, just a few weeks ago, what he has announced today was predicted to cause financial Armageddon. When should the City of London, mortgage payers and everybody else now expect the run on the pound that was predicted by the Leader of the House of Commons?"
"I rise today to recognize E.J. Basler Co. in Schiller Park, Illinois. E.J. Basler Co., a family-owned manufacturing company, has been based in Schiller Park since 1957. The company was built on the core values of quality and customer service, founded by Erv and Anne Basler, children of immigrants. Now in its third generation of family leadership, E.J. Basler Co. is run by Dennis and Brian Basler. Their ongoing commitment to responsive service and high-quality manufacturing has supported strong, long-term relationships with clients and vendors in Illinois' fifth district and across the globe. E.J. Basler Co. has achieved lasting success by staying true to its original values while evolving with current times. E.J. Basler Co. offers precision machinery services that leverage different techniques, cutting-edge technology, and expertise to create the most cost-effective solutions for customers. They manufacture from iconel, brass, steel, plastic, and copper. Manufacturing is crucial to the global economy, and E.J. Basler Co. delivers high-quality solutions across industries, working with the best of agriculture, plumbing, automotive, industrial, defense, and medical companies. The close proximity to E.J. Basler Co. and its valuable services offer companies in Illinois' fifth district a competitive advantage and drive economic development within the district.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the longstanding dedication and success of E.J. Basler Co. I am honored to have such an exceptional company in my district."
"Oh, oh!"
"Mr. Chair, I have answered that question a number of times. I will try one more time. People leaving because of an expired visa or deportation, or anything of that matter, is the purview of the Canada Border Services Agency, which is not—"
"I join my hon. Friend in thanking all those who work with Tough Enough To Care, and thank him for highlighting the important work that it does. It is still absolutely shocking that the biggest cause of death for men under the age of 50 is suicide, and the work of Tough Enough To Care and others is vital in addressing that."
"I am afraid I cannot give the right hon. Lady a date today, but I can assure her that I am fully cognisant of this issue. We need to look at whether there is any requirement for any future schemes. As soon as we are in a position to provide updates, I will come back to this House and be sure to provide hon. Members will all the relevant information."
"Mr. Speaker, what I find sad is that, when faced with these challenges, what Quebeckers and Canadians voted for in the last election was a minority government. When I went door to door, a lot of voters said they hoped that people would co-operate and work together. However, what we are seeing is a government that is imposing time allocation on a bill that would fundamentally change the way the government operates. Should we accept this without asking any questions and without anyone being able to look at what is in this bill? To me, that is deeply concerning."
"Mr. Speaker, as you know, my mandate is to help diversify trade around the world for Canadian businesses. That is what Canadian businesses expect us to do, especially when we go through some difficulties with our neighbour down south, and that is what my focus will be as a trade minister."
"Thank you for your wisdom, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will move to the end of my speech. I have a simple ask. It is about the power that we give, but it is also about funding. I recognise that sometimes the reason the answer is no is that decisions have to be taken, and I have two thoughts on that. First, could we look at ways to make the decision-making process less expensive? One way of doing so would simply be to trust local knowledge more than we do. If necessary, could we not also mandate that councils put aside more funding for this area? As we have heard from interventions, this is clearly and evidently one of the top issues that our constituents raise with us. Residents have a right to know that when they speak with a collective voice, that voice gets heard and respected at all levels of government, from this place down to their parish councils. Councils are democratically elected, accountable and rooted in their communities. Residents' lived experience offers better long-term insight than one-off traffic monitoring snapshots. The current system prioritises administrative thresholds over genuine local need. The Government's commitment to localism and community empowerment should apply to road safety too, and I genuinely welcome their commitment to giving back control to the British people over many parts of their lives; this is another area where people are asking to have more control. Before I finish, it would be remiss of me not to put one more road safety issue on record, having unsuccessfully bobbed through two lots of Transport questions and the spending review. That issue is the future of the A66--an important piece of national infrastructure--and that future is decided not by parish councils, but by the Treasury. I would be grateful to know the timeframe for getting a response on that, because the dualling of the A66 is uncertain. It is an important piece of national infrastructure for the north of England--for people crossing the Pennines from east to west. Dualling would reduce the time it takes to get to the Lake district and would mean far fewer road closures, which really impact on people's lives. There have also been far too many fatalities in the area. I wanted to steal those last few seconds to put that on the record. I thank Members for their time this evening."
"Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's very insightful question. I cannot answer to what the government members were thinking by putting this forward, but I do know that there is a general trend that we have seen from the Liberal government, of trying to do omnibus legislation so they can advance things that are very unpopular or unconstitutional while hiding behind things that are popular and that all parties would agree with. I fear that is precisely what the Liberals are doing with this bill, by going after civil liberties while also offering things that are important that we could all agree on, such as the need to get tough on border security."
I just want to say how proud I am that my hon. Friend is here in this Chamber as an LGBT MP. Does he share my pride in everyone who is here taking part in the debate this evening?
"I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Congressional Record a letter containing the legal opinion of the Government Accountability Office, no. B-337200, titled ``U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management--Applicability of the Congressional Review Act to Central Yukon Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan,'' dated June 25, 2025. The letter provides notification that the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management Central Yukon Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan is a rule subject to the Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 801 et seq. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Decision  Matter of: U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management--Applicability of the Congressional Review Act to Central Yukon Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan File: B-337200 Date: June 25, 2025  DIGEST  The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued the Central Yukon Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan (Central Yukon RMP). The Central Yukon RMP provides management direction for 13.3 million acres of BLM-managed public lands within Alaska's Central Yukon planning area. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires that before a rule can take effect, an agency must submit the rule to both the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as the Comptroller General. CRA adopts the definition of ``rule'' under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) but excludes certain categories of rules from coverage. We conclude that the Central Yukon RMP meets the APA definition of a rule, and no CRA exception applies. Therefore, the Central Yukon RMP is a rule subject to CRA's submission requirements.  DECISION  In November 2024, the U.S. Department of the Interior (Interior), Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued a record of decision and resource management plan titled, Central Yukon Record of Decision and Approved Resource Management Plan (Central Yukon RMP).\1\ We received a request for a decision as to whether the Central Yukon RMP is a rule for purposes of the Congressional Review Act (CRA).\2\ As discussed below, we conclude that the Central Yukon RMP is a rule for purposes of CRA. Our practice when issuing decisions is to obtain the legal views of the relevant agency on the subject of the request.\3\ Accordingly, we reached out to Interior to obtain the agency's legal views.\4\ We received Interior's response on May 5, 2025.\5\  BACKGROUND  BLM Public Land Management Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended (FLPMA), BLM is responsible for developing, maintaining, and, when appropriate, revising ``land use plans which provide by tracts or areas for the use of the public lands.'' \6\ BLM land use plans, referred to as ``resource management plans'' (RMPs), establish goals and objectives to guide future land and resource management actions implemented by BLM.\7\ Pursuant to FLPMA, BLM established procedures for the development, revision, and amendment of RMPs.\8\ The objective of resource management planning is to maximize resource values for the public through a rational consistently applied set of regulations and procedures which promote the concept of multiple use management.\9\ An RMP generally establishes land use designations; allowable resource uses; resource conditions, goals, and objectives; program constraints and general management practices; areas to be covered by more specific plans; and other related information.\10\ Central Yukon Resource Management Plan The Central Yukon planning area comprises 56 million acres in Central and Northern Alaska.\11\ BLM manages about one quarter, or 13 million, of those acres.\12\ On November 12, 2024, BLM's Alaska State Director approved the Central Yukon RMP, which provides a comprehensive land use plan to direct the management of these BLM-managed lands.\13\ Ten days later, BLM published a notice of availability in the Federal Register.\14\ The Central Yukon RMP replaces two RMPs approved in 1986 and 1991 and portions of a 1981 management framework plan.\15\ It also provides RMP-level decisions for unplanned lands west of Fairbanks, Alaska.\16\ In addition, the Central Yukon RMP designates 21 areas of critical environmental concern or research natural areas covering 3.6 million acres.\17\ On January 20, 2025, the President issued Executive Order No. 14153, Unleashing Alaska's Extraordinary Resource Potential, which in part directed the Secretary of the Interior to rescind the Central Yukon RMP and ``reimplement the draft resource management plan and environmental impact statement referenced in the National Park Service notice entitled `Notice of Availability for the Central Yukon Draft Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement, Alaska,' 85 Fed. Reg. 80143 (December 11, 2020).'' \18\ On February 3, 2025, the Secretary of the Interior issued an order that, among other things, directed the submission of an action plan outlining the steps to execute those executive order provisions.\19\ In its response to us, Interior stated that the Central Yukon RMP is in effect and BLM is reviewing it for consistency with the executive order and Secretary's order.\20\ Congressional Review Act CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight of agency rulemaking, requires federal agencies to submit a report on each new rule to both houses of Congress and to the Comptroller General for review before a rule can take effect.\21\ The report must contain a copy of the rule, ``a concise general statement relating to the rule,'' and the rule's proposed effective date.\22\ CRA allows Congress to review and disapprove rules issued by federal agencies for a period of 60 days using special procedures.\23\ If a resolution of disapproval is enacted, then the new rule has no force or effect.\24\ CRA adopts the definition of a rule under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which states that a rule is ``the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency.'' \25\ However, CRA excludes three categories of rules from coverage: (1) rules of particular applicability; (2) rules relating to agency management or personnel; and (3) rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice that do not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties.\26\ Interior did not submit a CRA report to Congress or the Comptroller General on the Central Yukon RMP. In its response to us, Interior provided additional information about the Central Yukon RMP but did not state a position as to whether it is a rule under CRA.\27\  discussion  To determine whether the Central Yukon RMP is a rule subject to review under CRA, we first address whether it meets the APA definition of a rule. As explained below, we conclude that it does. We then consider whether the Central Yukon RMP falls within any CRA exceptions. We conclude that it does not. Therefore, the Central Yukon RMP is a rule subject to review under CRA. The Central Yukon RMP is a Rule Under APA Applying APA's definition of rule, the Central Yukon RMP meets all of the required elements. First, the Central Yukon RMP is an agency statement as it was issued by BLM, a federal agency.\28\ Second, the Central Yukon RMP is of future effect as it is to be used prospectively to guide the management of the Central Yukon planning area and later site-specific projects.\29\ Decisions made in the Central Yukon RMP became effective on November 12, 2024, when the ROD was signed.\30\ As of that date, according to BLM, the Central Yukon RMP will guide management of BLM-managed public lands in the planning area for the next 15 to 20 years for the benefit of current and future generations.\31\ Therefore, the Central Yukon RMP has future effect. Finally, the Central Yukon RMP implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy because it prescribes and implements a consolidated direction under one plan to address land and resource use and development on BLM-managed public lands within the planning area in accordance with FLPMA.\32\ Our conclusion here is consistent with our previous decisions finding that similar land use programs and RMPs implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\33\ For instance, in B-238859, Oct. 23, 2017, we found that an amendment to the Forest Service's Tongass Land and Resource Management Plan (Tongass Amendment) implemented law by establishing new criteria for the sale of timber to non- agency parties. We explained that with the Tongass Amendment, the Forest Service set forth its policy for timber sales and thus implemented its statutory responsibility under the National Forest Management Act.\34\ Similarly in B-329065, Nov. 15, 2017, we concluded that four RMPs issued by BLM prescribed policy by establishing available uses for the areas that each RMP covered. We     noted that each RMP implemented provisions of FLPMA and other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.\35\ The same can be said of the Central Yukon RMP here. The Central Yukon RMP implements FLPMA and prescribes policy by designating or foreclosing specific activities or land use on BLM-administer land. As such, the Central Yukon RMP meets the third element of the APA definition of rule. Having satisfied all the required elements, the Central Yukon RMP meets the APA definition of rule. CRA Exceptions We must next determine whether any of CRA's three exceptions apply. CRA provides for three types of rules that are not subject to its requirements: (1) rules of particular applicability; (2) rules relating to agency management or personnel; and (3) rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice that do not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties.\36\ (1) Rule of Particular Applicability Consistent with our previous decisions, the Central Yukon RMP is a rule of general applicability, rather than particular applicability. In B-238859, Oct. 23, 2017, the Forest Service proffered that its Tongass Amendment was a rule of particular applicability because it applied to a single national forest. We disagreed, noting that the Tongass Amendment governed all natural resource management activities, all projects approved to take place, and all persons or entities using the forest. As such, it was a rule of general applicability.\37\ Likewise, the Central Yukon RMP addresses land and resource use and development by any person or entity on BLM-managed public lands within the Central Yukon planning area, making it a rule of general applicability. (2) Rule of Agency Management or Personnel The Central Yukon RMP is not a rule of agency management or personnel. We have previously held that rules that fall into this category relate to purely internal agency matters.\38\ Because the Central Yukon RMP is concerned with public use of the areas it governs rather than management of BLM itself or its personnel, it does not meet CRA's second exception. (3) Rule of Agency Organization, Procedure, or Practice That Does Not Substantially Affect Non-Agency Parties Lastly, the Central Yukon RMP is not a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties.\39\ We have previously explained that this exception was modeled on the APA exception to notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements for ``rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice[.]'' \40\ The purpose of the APA exception is to ensure ``that agencies retain latitude in organizing their internal operations,'' so long as such rules do not have a substantial impact on non-agency parties.\41\ Following this interpretation in the CRA context, we have only applied CRA's third exception to rules that primarily focus on the internal operations of an agency. For instance, in B-329926, Sept. 10, 2018, we found that updates to a Social Security Administration (SSA) hearing manual governing SSA adjudicators' use of information from the internet qualified as a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice. There, the manual outlined procedures for SSA employees to follow in processing and adjudicating benefits claims. Because the manual was directed to and binding only on SSA officials without imposing new burdens on claimants, we concluded that the manual met CRA's third exception.\42\ In contrast, rules that are directed at and primarily concerned with the behavior of non-agency parties do not fall within this category.\43\ Thus, in B-274505, Sept. 16, 1996, we declined to apply CRA's third exception to a Forest Service memorandum on the Emergency Salvage Timber Sale Program, because it was not limited to the Forest Service's methods of operations. Instead, the memorandum established the standards by which program determinations would be made, thus directly affecting the area for and number of timber sales that would result in contracts. In essence the memorandum went beyond how the Forest Service organized its internal operations.\44\ Similarly, in B-238859, Oct. 23, 2017, we declined to apply CRA's third exception to the Tongass Amendment, because it was directed at land and resource use by non-agency parties.\45\ Here, the Central Yukon RMP does entail some changes to agency procedure. For example, it describes the mitigation measures BLM will apply to BLM-authorized activities within the planning area, which include an adaptive management process for implementing the RMP.\46\ Appendix E of the Central Yukon RMP sets forth detailed standard operating procedures and fluid mineral leasing stipulations.\47\ And the Central Yukon RMP discusses how BLM will develop an implementation plan, monitor the RMP's implementation, and periodically evaluate the needs for revisions or amendments at least every five years.\48\ However, like the Forest Service memorandum in B-274505 and the Tongass Amendment in B-238859, the Central Yukon RMP is not limited to changes in internal agency operations. Instead, the Central Yukon RMP is directed at, and concerns itself primarily with, the behavior of non-agency parties. Therefore, the Central Yukon RMP does not qualify as a rule of agency organization, procedure or practice. We must also consider whether the Central Yukon RMP substantially affects the rights or obligations of non-agency parties.\49\ When analyzing this aspect of CRA's third exception, ``the critical question is whether the agency action alters the rights or interests of regulated entities.'' \50\ Along similar lines, courts have determined that ``[a]n agency rule that modifies substantive rights and obligations can only be nominally procedural, and the exemption for such rules of agency procedure cannot apply.'' \51\ In previous decisions, we have consistently concluded that where an RMP designates use by non-agency parties in the areas it governs, it has a substantial effect.\52\ For instance, in B-275178, July 3, 1997, we reached this conclusion by noting that the Forest Service's RMP provided a ``management prescription'' giving general direction on what may occur within an area allocated to a particular land use designation. Similarly, in B-329065, Nov. 15, 2017, we concluded that four BLM RMPs had a substantial effect on non- agency parties where the plans limited the use of public land and prohibited mining and operation of off-highway vehicles in the areas they governed. Consistent with our caselaw on other RMPs, the Central Yukon RMP has a substantial effect on non-agency parties. For example, the Central Yukon RMP recommends that the Secretary of the Interior make 11.1 million acres of land eligible for selection by Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans through the partial revocation of certain withdrawals under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and prescribes actions veterans may take on those allotments.\53\ The Central Yukon RMP also makes land use designations and describes what activities may be conducted on the land, such as designating land as areas of critical environmental concern, to protect fish habitat, and closing off certain of these areas to mineral materials disposal or mineral extraction.\54\ The Central Yukon RMP also takes additional actions such as implementing mitigation management actions, including increased collaboration and coordination with other agencies and landowners,\55\ and designating backcountry conservation areas.\56\ As a result, BLM has foreclosed non-agency parties from mineral disposal and extraction and certain recreational activities in the Central Yukon planning area. Accordingly, the Central Yukon RMP fails to meet CRA's third exception.  conclusion  The Central Yukon RMP is a rule for purposes of CRA because it meets the definition of a rule under APA and no CRA exception applies. Therefore, the Central Yukon RMP is subject to CRA's requirement that it be submitted to Congress and the Comptroller General before it can take effect. Edda Emmanuelli Perez, General Counsel.

"Elon Musk has left the building. Yet, unfortunately, his legacy of chaos and corruption lives on. The zombie of DOGE lurches on here in the House with the delivery of a $9.4 billion rescission package to make those cuts permanent, a fiscal year 2026 budget delivered in front of the Committee on Appropriations to eviscerate Federal programs, and, yes, the disgusting abomination of reconciliation that is in front of the Senate right now. Though Elon Musk has exited the building, a new villain has entered the chat with OMB. Let's evaluate the legacy that leaves behind thousands fired, agencies dismantled, shattered lives, starving children, over 200 lawsuits, and a grift for the ages as Musk stole data, primed the pump for billions in contracts, and set our agencies on a path for privatization. Yet, let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. No one is above the law; not Elon Musk; not the OMB Director; not Donald Trump; not the grifter in chief. We will hold them accountable."
"I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman has apologised to his constituents for the total mess that the Conservatives made of HS2. We are fixing their mess and getting a grip of the project costs. Frankly, it is astounding for the right hon. Gentleman to raise HS2, given the mess they made of it."
"Mr. Speaker, Canadians love our proud heritage and proud nature coast to coast to coast. However, I will point out once again that there is a Minister of Canadian Identity and a Secretary of State for Nature who are responsible for those files. I am sure they will be happy to answer those questions."
"Mr. Speaker, Canadians want clean air. Canadians want innovation. Many Canadians, especially in my home province of British Columbia, are eager to embrace electric vehicles. I come from one of the most beautiful and most creative parts of the country. We are deeply committed to preserving that beauty, and we strive to find the technologies that will protect it. I am genuinely excited about the future of electric vehicles and the role they can play in reducing emissions and driving technological progress. I am also excited about hydrogen fuel cells, renewable fuels and many other breakthroughs revving up across the transportation sector, as well as the technologies that have not even been conceived yet. When innovation is allowed to flourish, Canada wins. Variety, they say, is the spice of life. On our vast roads and rugged terrain, Canadians want and need a full range of options, all the gears in the gear shift, so to say, from EVs to hybrids, sustainable fuels and even increasingly efficient internal combustion engines. I am so glad to see our entrepreneurs and our market delivering just that. What Canadians do not want and absolutely cannot afford are heavy-handed mandates from Ottawa that jack up costs, punish small businesses and stall out consumer choice in the fast lane of central planning. That is not welcome in my community. Unfortunately, that is exactly what the Liberal government's so-called zero-emission vehicle sales target does. It is being branded as a target, but it is a 10-year road to a ban, the “no more gas vehicles” ban, a regulatory sledgehammer disguised as a goal. Backed by fines and compliance quotas, this is not about helping the environment; it is about pushing all Canadians to the outcome the Liberal government wants, whether they like it or not. That is why our Conservative motion today puts the brakes on this policy and puts Canadians back in the driver's seat. We are calling on the government to immediately give Canadians the freedom to choose vehicles that meet their needs at a price they can actually afford. I have been listening to the auto sector. The Canadian Automobile Dealers Association has been sounding the alarm. It knows what the Liberals refuse to admit: that this plan is out of step with the reality on the ground. EV adoption has been growing, and that is a good thing, but it has happened because of consumer choice, smart incentives and infrastructure investment, not because of government strong-arming. Instead of encouraging choice, the government is taking it away. Federal and provincial rebates are being scaled back. Charging infrastructure is still patchy, especially in rural and northern communities. People in apartments and townhomes cannot plug in. Canadians want clean transportation, but they also want vehicles that fit their budgets, their geography and their daily lives. That is why the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association has warned that this Liberal policy is unrealistic and will lead to significant cost increases for consumers. The mandate forces car dealers to carry large, expensive EV inventories that often do not match local demand, especially in small cities like mine and in rural areas. The burden of compliance, along with penalties for non-compliance, is being downloaded onto dealers. That means it will ultimately find its way to consumers. The Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association has also raised concerns about supply chain readiness and the speed of transition. A decade may feel like a long time, but in the world of design and in the current context, 2035 is actually quite near. Canada still lacks the domestic capacity to fully support the shift at this speed. The automotive industry in Canada is already coping with tariffs and volatility. It does not need this on top of it. Under this policy, car companies that sell even one gas vehicle above the Liberal quota could face penalties of up to $20,000 per car. That cost gets passed down straight to the consumer. At a time when groceries are out of reach, mortgages are ballooning and food bank lines are growing, the Liberals want to make vehicles more expensive by design. How out of touch can they get? This is not just bad for drivers; it is a head-on collision with small businesses. Dealerships, especially in small cities like Nanaimo, are being forced to carry excess or even double inventories. They have to stock expensive EVs that may sit unsold alongside the gas-powered vehicles that are more affordable and more in demand in their showrooms. That is a massive financial burden, and then Ottawa penalizes them if they do not sell enough of the EVs that no one is asking for. That is not a policy. That is a lemon. It is going to hurt the very Canadians the government wants to help. In the rural parts of my community, people rely on pickups. In northern climates, they need vehicles that can handle snow, cold and long distances without worrying about where they are going to find a charging station. In all of the communities across this great country, people want choice. They want the freedom to choose what works for their family, what works for their job and what works for their wallet. What they do not want is a Prime Minister in the driver's seat deciding what kind of car they are allowed to buy. Conservatives believe in innovation. We believe in clean technology and we believe in reducing emissions. We also believe in choice and competition, and yes, we believe in common sense. The demand for electric vehicles is plateauing. It may be that the current economy is creating challenges for affordability. It may be that the demand for electric vehicles has reached its saturation. After years of growth driven by early adopters and government rebates, the market is now cooling because many Canadians simply cannot afford the high upfront costs, do not have access to charging infrastructure or might not be convinced that EVs meet their needs in our climate and geography. However, rather than adjusting government policy and adjusting course to help Canadians during these difficult times, the Liberals are demanding that we adjust course, that we change our behaviour to suit their needs and desires. They are not responding to market trends. They are trying to manufacture those trends and coerce Canadians with quotas. That is not innovation. That is desperation and control. We have an opportunity to steer Canada back in the right direction. Let us invest in infrastructure. Let us support a range of clean technologies. Let us let demand grow organically. Let us recognize that there is more than one route to an emissions reduction. Hybrid vehicles, hydrogen power, sustainable fuels and, yes, even better internal combustion engines all have a place on the road to a more sustainable future. Above all, let us listen to the workers who build our cars, the family-run dealerships that sell our cars and the Canadians who drive them every single day. The Liberal plan is broken. It is unaffordable, it is unrealistic and it is unfair. It is time to shift gears. Let us support this Conservative motion. Let us end the ban, and let us give Canadians back the keys to their own decisions and their own future."
"Madam Speaker, over the course of the past few weeks, we have watched as devastating wildfires have ravaged through my home province of Manitoba and the neighbouring province of Saskatchewan. Entire communities have been evacuated, homes have been lost, and the air quality has been so poor that everyday activities have been rendered very difficult. Unsurprisingly, in places like Winnipeg, my hometown, the community has responded with kindness and generosity. Can the Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience share with this House how other Canadians can step up in this moment of need?"
"Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to once again rise in the people's House. I always count it a privilege, and it is the first time I am addressing the House with a speech since being re-elected by the great people of Tobique—Mactaquac. I want to express my appreciation and heartfelt thanks to them and to my family for all their love, support and care. It is truly the honour of my life to serve here in the people's House, so I want to thank them. It is a privilege to rise on this opposition motion. Our motion is to hold the government to account and put forward alternatives that would serve the people of Canada. It is only responsible for any government, and let alone government, but any family or business, to bring forth a budget and to plan, to make sure to, at the end of the day, when at all possible, balance the budget and make sure there is enough there to pay the bills, meet the obligations and hopefully, if they are fortunate enough, have a little bit to set aside for the future. What is true for a household and a business should also be true for any government, especially the Government of Canada, but right now, we are going into one of the longest periods in our history without having a budget tabled. I think Canadians from coast to coast are wondering when that budget will get tabled. It is wonderful to have great ideas, have wonderful plans and talk a great game, but can it back it up with the dollars and cents, the budgetary means, to both make it happen and be responsible? I think Canadians are looking to us to provide reasonable alternatives and to make sure we hold the government to account in regard to this. I have a few remarks today. I guess, the way to sum it up is from my background. I like the use of alliteration, so I have four Cs, and I am going to try to cover them quickly in the short time that we have. There are four Cs to seeing our way clear. The first C we need to address here today is the challenges we face. When we start thinking about the challenges we face as a nation, none of us should be ignorant of these, as we have several. One of the first and foremost challenges is the rising cost of living. We have heard a lot about how our food inflation is the highest in the G7, but I do not have to look at an economics report to realize that. I just have to visit a local grocery store and talk to the seniors who are on fixed incomes trying to make ends meet or talk to the young families who are trying to make their mortgage payments and their vehicle payments, keep their kids in sports and maybe plan for a bit of a trip, if they could at the end of the day, while putting food on the table. When I talk to them, I soon realize the challenges we are facing as they relate to food inflation and the soaring cost of groceries. The challenges we face are not just what is happening at home, here in our country. We are also obviously feeling the effects of the global uncertainty happening right now: wars, rumours of wars, conflicts and riots. We are seeing instability. We are seeing things that once seemed so certain that no longer seem certain. With that, there is rising anxiety, fear and despair. We, as elected representatives, pick that up in our daily conversations and interactions with people. We hear it, and we cannot help but be affected by it. We are surrounded by those challenges, and yes, Canada's not immune to the external threats, but there are a lot of those that we do not have direct control over. We cannot affect what is happening overseas on a grand scale. We have a limited amount that we can say and do in regard to the vast geopolitical challenges facing our world. The greatest threat to us, far more than anything that may be happening externally or some strong southern wind that may blow in from time to time, is the threats that are within. We have gone through an era of Canadian self-sabotage. That is the biggest threat that the House has the responsibility to address. It was no external force that brought a carbon tax on our people. It was no external government that shut down pipeline construction and passed Bill C-69 and Bill C-48 . It was no external government that brought the highest levels of taxation in comparison to other advanced economies. It was our own government in our own country. That is the biggest challenge we have to face, which is to get our own house in order and have a massive course correction so that we can change the way we are going. If we deal with our problems within, we can face the challenges without with confidence. Though our challenges are many and that is the first C, I have to deal with the second C, which refers to contradictions. We are filled with contradictions when I consider the record of our dear friends on the other side. These were the ones who said that, if we do not put in a carbon tax, we will burn our planet. These are the ones who said that, if we do not put the cost on carbon, we are going to absolutely destroy our environment in this country. I am glad they contradicted themselves most recently and adopted our policy of eliminating, or reducing, as I think that, for now, it has been eliminated for the consumer, the carbon tax. They realized that it is a punitive tax that accomplished nothing as it relates to the environment and only had a diminishing impact on the pocketbooks of Canadians. I thank them for recognizing that the carbon tax served no purpose but to punish our own citizens. The contradictions continue. While they reduced the rate of the carbon tax to zero, as a result of the election, they kept the carbon tax on, and are going to put it on, industry, thinking, somehow, that the industries are not going to transmit those costs back to the consumers, who are ultimately Canadians. Talk about contradictions. It is really quite something. These are the same ones who were against pipeline construction, who talked down our oil and gas sector for 10 years and who said that it was dirty oil and dirty gas. All of a sudden, they are becoming champions for it. I am thankful for the road-to-Damascus experience my friends on the other side have had, and I hope it continues, but I cannot help but be struck by the contradiction. Canadians must be scratching their heads and asking if this is the same crew. They look the same. They sound somewhat the same but they are talking a new talk. I think that, if we are going to overcome and see our way clear, we have to overcome the contradictions between what they have done in policy and what they are saying in rhetoric. Let us get the policy fixed so that we can get the country on the right course. That is the third C. I have to get to my third and fourth Cs. The second was the contradictions we have to overcome. Do members know what that means, if we overcome the contradictions? We have to have a course correction. It is time to change course. It is time to stop pitting one region against another region. It is time to stop pitting rural Canadians against urban Canadians. It is time to stop pitting family against family and start bringing Canadians together to do something big for the country, which is, yes, to build the infrastructure necessary to get our energy and our resources to world markets so that we can lift our standard of living and tackle the food inflation crisis face on. It is time to get off the backs of our farmers, producers and workers and leave more of the money in their pockets, the money that they have worked hard to earn. It is time that we change course as a country and get on the right way. By doing that, we will start seeing our way clear. I challenge the House to consider a severe course correction from the error and the era of Canadian self-sabotage to the time and the season of great change that will bring prosperity, not just to a certain element of our society, the elite and the sophisticated, but to all Canadians, especially the working class, those who put boots on every day, carry their buckets to work and wait on our tables. They are those who have often been overlooked and forgotten. Let us change course and make sure that their needs are addressed in the House. The last C I am going to end on is this: There is a question that comes in the midst of a crisis. Oftentimes, we look at who can save us, what can save us, what can change it and what can help us. I think we have to ask ourselves what it is in our own house that needs to be addressed. If we look at what is in our own house, we can find the answers to our problem. Stop blaming that which is without. Stop looking everywhere else to escape our own responsibility. Let us change course within and unleash the potential of Canada's resource, energy and farming sectors, and watch us overcome any challenge we could ever face. It is time to get our own house in order."
"I know the Chancellor considers herself to be a world-leading economist, so can she tell me how it is that everyone in the country knew that hiking taxes on employers' national insurance contributions--making it more expensive to employ people--would destroy jobs, destroy businesses and destroy the economy, and the only people who did not know that were her and her socialist boss?"
"I start by welcoming reports that the Chancellor will give winter fuel payments to more pensioners this winter, although because we still await the details, we will reserve our full judgment. I recognise the efforts of the Prime Minister to pull out all the stops to avoid President Trump's damaging tariffs: a letter from the King, offering to water down online safety laws and even trying to send the Open to one of Trump's golf courses. The Prime Minister thought he had secured 0% tariffs for British steel, but now Trump is threatening us with 50% unless we comply with his new, five-week deadline. This is classic Trump--changing the terms of a deal he has already agreed. Does the Prime Minister share my fear that nothing will stop Trump messing the UK around, short of bunging a few hundred million pounds into his TrumpCoin?"
"Mr. Speaker, I think there are those who would argue that it is not the only measure that has brought down emissions, and I am sure the government will come forward with its plan in due time."
"Mr. Speaker, tents are not houses. The Prime Minister told us during the campaign that Canada was facing the biggest crisis of our lifetime. Well, here is a crisis: In 2015, housing costs were an average of 38% of Canadian household budgets. Today, it is overwhelming. It is 52%. A recent study found that Toronto residents spend more of their income on housing than nearly every other city in the world. We were told that the Prime Minister is the “man with the plan”. Canadians want to see it, and time is of the essence. When are we going to get a budget?"
"The all-party parliamentary group for Africa, which I chair, recently published its report on Africa's just energy transition to accessible and renewable clean energy. What assessment has the Minister made of the report's nine recommendations, including the recommendation on reforming carbon markets so that they work in Africa's interests, and the recommendation on ensuring that international development funding is blended with private sector funding for investment in that transition?"
"History repeats itself. In 1935, we spent just 3% of national wealth on defence, and because we rearmed almost too late, we almost lost civilisation. By 1945, we were spending 52% of national wealth on defence. Given that we face a crisis in Europe, with an unparalleled Russian rearmament almost as great as that of Germany in the 1930s, will the Secretary of State do the right thing by history and give this House a firm commitment to 3.5%, not as an ambition, but by a set date?"
"Mr. Speaker, the NDP agrees to apply the vote and will totally be voting in favour of the motion."
"Madam Chair, what I can guarantee to the member is that I will, like all my colleagues, fight for Canadian industry and Canadian workers, because we need a very strong steel industry to build Canada strong."
"Recently, I attended a service marking 40 years since William Heenan was murdered by the IRA for being a Protestant. While we honoured his memory, the self-proclaimed ""First Minister for all"" in Northern Ireland was visiting the newly erected statue of IRA terrorist Bobby Sands, glorifying the movement responsible for the cold-blooded murder of men such as William. Will the Minister agree to meet me and innocent victims from Northern Ireland regarding the review and improvement of the glorification of terrorism legislation that applies to Northern Ireland?"
The hon. member.
"reserving the right to object, I think it is pretty rich for the party of President Biden to talk about improprieties. I object."
"Mr. Chair, the gun buyback program is in its early stages. We have already bought back 12,000 firearms."
"Madam Speaker, it is interesting. The more we speak to our colleagues, the more we find that we have similar histories and stories to share. The contribution of immigrants to this country cannot be underestimated or minimized. Canada, in many ways, is a country of immigrants. In speaking to folks at the doors, sharing these stories and finding other affinities and similarities in our histories, it has really been an eye-opening and enlightening process. It is pivotal to remember that when we are looking at statistics with respect to immigration numbers, these are not just numbers; these are people. These are lives. These are stories being told. These are communities being built, with country building happening before our eyes. It is important that as a federal government, we continue to support immigrants who come here and continue to contribute."
"Mr. Speaker, there are many things I would like to say, but let me read something verbatim about this so maybe the person will have a better appreciation. This is with respect to strengthening the requirements for the procurement of professional services, which take effect almost immediately, on July 1. Measure 1 is entitled “Value Cap on Task-Based Informatics Professional Services and Task and Solutions Professional Services—Task contracts”. Another measure is “Duration Cap on Task-Based Informatics Professional Services and Task and Solutions Professional Services—Task Contracts”. The third measure is entitled “Amendment Cap on Task-Based Informatics Professional Services and Task and Solutions Professional Services—Task Contracts”. The point is that there are many different actions that the newly elected Prime Minister , with the administration, has already taken on the file, even given the government's focus on and goal of building one strong Canadian economy, the strongest in the G7. We can do other things too."
"Mr. Speaker, we are committed to ensuring that full retail-subsidy benefits reach northerners. To enhance accountability, we formed the nutrition north compliance and audit review committee with indigenous and regional representatives. We recognize that food is more than nutrition; it is also cultural identity and sovereignty. We are committed to ensuring that the subsidy goes directly to northerners."
"Mr. Speaker, again I will reiterate that we are doing our work and thoughtfully preparing the estimates and work that is required to make sure that when we bring the budget forward in the fall, it has the right figures. There are many things at play at this particularly challenging time. After we do that work, we will be in the House to defend it and make sure that we table the numbers as appropriate."
"I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Downing), my friend."

"Probably because being that prescriptive about every housing development is not sensible, even if the thrust of what the hon. Member describes--that as new housing development is built, we need to ensure that local infrastructure goes alongside it--is the right approach. I take what he says about the number of GPs, and as I have said, we do not pretend to have fixed all the problems in 11 months, but with respect, those are three more GPs than were there before. I know there is more to do, but give me time, and we will rebuild general practice for his constituents and anyone else's."
I call the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats.
"The largest ever devolution settlement--PS50 billion--is great news for Scotland and its local authorities, but under the SNP there are 840,000 cases on NHS waiting lists. This affects people in my constituency in North Northumberland, many of whom use cross-border healthcare and dental services, so does the Minister  agree that the SNP needs to sort itself out and start delivering change to the NHS, as Labour is doing in England?"
"Mr. Chair, I can answer that. The report to Parliament in October had these population numbers, but now they do not, so I am wondering if the minister was trying to hide the data of the population numbers."
The hon. member.
"After a decade of under-investment in our critical minerals industry, the Conservative Government have left the UK wildly over-reliant on Chinese supply chains. In order to strengthen our national economic resilience, does the Minister agree that the UK's industrial strategy must support rapid acceleration of domestic production and processing of critical minerals?"
"Mr. Chair, it is Finance 101: The member can look at “The Fiscal Monitor” and the estimates. It is a great read. I would suggest it to the member."
"I thank the Secretary of State for the actions that she has taken today. They were clearly necessary, and it sounds like we are on a better track. However, HS2 provides little or nothing for rail users in the south-west, other than ongoing delays during the construction and operation of Old Oak Common. Will the Secretary of State consider funding, or prioritising the funding for, the critical final phase of the Dawlish rail resilience work that will help businesses and rail users in Devon and Cornwall--and perhaps even in Swindon?"
"Oh, oh!"
"Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague from Oshawa on her win. We all know that in order to get to the House of Commons, we have to knock on a lot of doors, listen to our constituents, form opinions and campaign very hard. I would like to know if she has a story to tell from her door knocking, because every time we knock on a door, every story we hear stays with us and shapes us as young politicians. Could she share a story with us, please?"
Would it?
"Mr. Speaker, it is nice to see someone from our region in the chair. I agree that there is a lot of work to do, and I do believe that many hands make light work. I think there are steps that we need to take. I would ask the member if programs, such as the tax-free child benefit, the school nutrition program and the help for not-for-profit organizations, especially through challenging times such as the pandemic, also help in the conversation we are having today?"
"It is a pleasure to cover for the shadow Secretary of State, who is speaking to farmers at the 140th Lincolnshire Agricultural Show. Having visited many such shows myself, including North Sheep 2025 and Cereals 2025 just last week, may I say how disappointed I am by the Secretary of State's lack of attendance at these crucial farming events? At a time when our farmers are going through some of the most extraordinary pressures in a generation, we have now learned that this Government have chosen to slash the farming budget. To make matters worse, Ministers have spent the past week trying to sell cuts of more than PS100 million a year in real terms as a historic deal for farmers. If the Secretary of State has secured such a historic deal for his Department, where does DEFRA rank compared with others in terms of cuts in the spending review?"
"A British surgeon in Gaza described it as a ""slaughterhouse"", babies are starving, and roads to aid are being described as ""combat zones"" by the IDF, so I welcome the sanctions on Israeli Ministers, who stated that they are ""destroying everything that remains in Gaza"". Their actions bear all the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing and plausible genocide. It is clear that the majority of us in this place want to recognise the state of Palestine, as do many of the public. Will the Minister feed back to the Prime Minister our strength of feeling on recognising Palestine now?"
"Through the child poverty taskforce, we have been looking at the issue of incomes versus expenditures. We are taking steps urgently where we are able, but we will have more to say about that issue shortly."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, before I get to the specifics of this bill, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Congressman Ritchie Torres who has been an outstanding co-lead and steadfast advocate for the Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act. This has been a long journey leading up to today's vote, and I thank Representative Torres for his unyielding desire to put a stop to the scourge of abusive mortgage trigger leads. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2808, the Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act will literally impact each and every consumer that applies for a mortgage in this country. Currently, credit bureaus are notified when a consumer applies for mortgage financing. That information, which is referred to as a trigger lead, is then often sold by the credit bureaus to data brokers and other lenders without the consumer's knowledge or approval. Consumers are then often bombarded with hundreds of unwanted solicitations. The Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act would dramatically reduce the number of unwanted calls and messages that millions endure during the home-buying process.  {time}  1745  The bill prohibits a consumer reporting agency from furnishing a trigger lead to a third party unless the consumer has opted in. The third party must be a federally insured depository institution, a federally insured credit union, or an originator or servicer of a consumer's existing mortgage. Agencies can also furnish a trigger lead if a consumer has a preexisting relationship with a covered entity. Over the years, I have heard from individuals from all walks of life about their deep-seated frustrations when it comes to being inundated by abusive mortgage credit trigger leads. Being contacted dozens to hundreds of times a day after applying for a mortgage is simply unacceptable. Many abusive trigger leads occur at nearly all hours of the day and night. This is especially true if the trigger lead user resides in a different time zone than the individual that they are contacting. It is also important to note that many of these merciless trigger leads come from unscrupulous companies that misrepresent the important fact that they are not affiliated with the mortgage company the individual initially applied with. Another important factor to consider is that when consumers get flooded with trigger leads, they often blame their mortgage originator, despite that mortgage originator having no role in selling their information. Just this weekend, my own sister-in-law, who applied for a mortgage last week, was inundated with literally hundreds of these contacts, so this is very personal to me and my family. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"Mr. Speaker, the member is speaking about lost Canadians and the people who should not lose their citizenship. We supported that. I supported that in the previous Parliament. That was the whole purpose of the senator's Bill S-245 . It was to fix that problem. That was a simple bill that came forward. Then that member and her party, along with members of the NDP, hijacked that private member's bill, adding a whole bunch of things. They changed it far beyond what was originally intended. In fact, the purpose of making it really simple and easy to digest, about the lost Canadians, was to actually get it through the process, because many had failed before. That was the whole point. It was to make it simple and get it through, yet that member and the Liberal government complicated it, added to it, hijacked the bill and made it something that was bad for Canadians, something that we could not support."
"Mr. Chair, we have a robust mechanism of rules in the Canadian government and rules are being followed."
"I recognise that there is a range of views on nuclear weapons. I also recognise that there are thousands and thousands of people in Scotland whose jobs are dependent on supporting our nuclear fleet, who do superb work at the bases on the Clyde and support not just the submarines, but our entire nuclear supply chain, through small and medium-sized enterprises and larger companies in factories, engineering workshops and other businesses across Scotland. I am certain that, although the hon. Gentleman and I might disagree on nuclear weapons, he was not speaking for those people when he made his point."
"This was an important area of debate when we were framing our recommendations. We felt that where mayoral areas could show ability--that might be a limited number--they might be much better able to understand the needs of business and to ensure that local technical colleges in particular provide the right kinds of skills and of qualifications. Sometimes we take too much of a central planning approach to the skills  system, which means we are just not agile enough for the needs of employers today, and skills gaps therefore loom much too large."
"Mr. Speaker, what we need to look at is the whole border bill, what it entails and, as I mentioned earlier, the expanded definition in the bill. Would it just address certain portions of the border or would it address more? I ask because previously I have questioned the hon. minister, and while it seems the bill is very restrictive, some of the definitions have become very expansive. That is why in my question earlier, I said the bill goes everywhere but addressing its actual needs."
"Mr. Speaker, the Liberals were elected on a promise to make Donald Trump's tariff threats their priority. However, what the first ministers discussed in Saskatoon today was not the new tariff threats against aluminum and steel. The priority they discussed was how to force Quebec to accept a dirty oil pipeline from the west. Quebeckers voted for a government that would protect them from Donald Trump. They did not vote for pipelines. Will the Liberals get their priorities straight?"
"My hon. Friend is right. As the House knows, justice delayed is justice denied. That is why this Government have doubled magistrate sentencing powers and funded a record number of sitting days. However, the scale of the challenge is beyond what increased sitting days can achieve alone. That is why we have asked Sir Brian Leveson to propose bold and ambitious reforms to deliver swifter justice for victims as part of the Government's plan for change."
"Let me start by thanking all the members of the Bill Committee, the Clerks, and the officials whose joy at receiving our 78 amendments I can only imagine to have been unbounded. The House will be pleased to hear that I will now be focusing only on those that we have prioritised for this debate. On Second Reading, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru were the only parties to vote against the Bill. All the others were content to support it; Labour and Green party Members nodded it through, while the Conservatives--the official Opposition--abstained. I hope that they will all consider their position more seriously on this occasion, and reconsider supporting some of the measures in the Bill, but if today the Liberal Democrats are again the only party to vote against the Bill--"
"Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. member that we should always be shopping locally. As someone who lived in Quebec for four years, I am very fond of the great businesses there, and I think it is great that she shared with us today that she had bought something local from Quebec. On just procurement and best practices, this is why we have an Auditor General. There are a number of oversight measures that we have in place in our government to ensure that, when things are not working, we try to root out the problem, and then, when we realize that things are not going well or things have gone badly, we take immediate action to correct it. That is what we—"
"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General's report is damning. Contracts were awarded without tender, without oversight and without justification. While Canadians are getting poorer, certain companies are getting richer. Some of the ministers responsible for this fiasco have even been promoted. Can the Prime Minister explain why he is choosing to reward those who allowed such a mess to happen, rather than holding them to account?"
"I am grateful to be here to co- anchor this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour for the month of June. I thank my esteemed colleague and dear friend, Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan, a Democrat from Virginia's Fourth District, for her outstanding leadership and for leading this incredible hour. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight during National Gun Violence Awareness Month not just with sorrow but with a sense of urgency. I rise tonight during the National Gun Violence Awareness Month to shake the core of our very beings. I want to be abundantly clear that this is not about taking away anyone's Second Amendment right to bear arms. Mr. Speaker, don't be fooled by the gun manufacturers that want to continue to put profits over people, over children, and over people's lives. I am from the South. I am a gun enthusiast. I do believe in the Second Amendment, but I am a responsible gun owner. I am trained to use my firearm. I understand the importance of proper storage, protection, and training. I understand the importance of having reasonable waiting periods and the importance of being familiar with your weapon and making sure it is never left where children or untrained people can gain access. Yes, the Second Amendment stands, but our common sense stands, too. We must protect communities and make sure that firearms never find their way into the hands of people who are ill-trained, who have ill intent, and who seek to cause the damage that we have seen with our mass shootings. For far too long, our Nation has tolerated an epidemic that is killing our children, our friends, and our future. Gun violence has ravaged this country. While every American feels the impact, Black communities bear the brunt. Black communities die from gun violence at 2.7 times the rate of our White counterparts. Let me say that again: 2.7 times the rate.  Over 13,300 Black lives are lost every year to gun violence. That is not a statistic. That is our sons, our daughters, our neighbors, and our church members. That is an entire generation lost. In 2023 alone, firearm homicides in Black communities rose by over 23 percent, suicides by 50 percent, and unintentional shootings by 11 percent. These are not isolated tragedies. This is a pattern, a crisis, an epidemic. Yet, this Congress remains stuck in neutral. It has been 3 years since the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was signed into law by President Biden. Did I say bipartisan? Yes, it was bipartisan. I voted for it. I stood proudly with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take this important step. Let's be honest. It was just that, one step. It was a step that needs to be followed up with more steps, more action, more help, and more signals that we are bigger and better than the gun lobby. Since then, since that one step, mass shootings have surged. Right now, families are afraid to go to the mall, the movie theater, schools, grocery stores, concerts, and places of worship. No one feels safe because, oftentimes, nowhere is safe. The Gun Violence Archive has already reported that 133 mass shootings have happened this year, and it is only the first week of June. Every shooting leaves behind a shattered family, a traumatized community, and a ripple effect that lasts generations. Let's be clear. Black Americans are not just victims of community violence. We are also disproportionately impacted by rogue police violence, police shootings, and shootings of unarmed men and women, often young people. The truth can't be ignored when we talk about gun violence in our country. Accountability must be a part of our reform. We know that thoughts and prayers after these tragedies are important and powerful, too, but words alone can't do it. We must put our well- wishes and our prayers into action. I recognize that at this moment, we demand action because words alone won't stop a bullet. I know that being silent wouldn't stop a bullet. I know being complicit won't stop a bullet. I know pointing fingers won't stop a bullet. I know running from the scoring of the NRA won't stop a bullet. I know what can stop a bullet. It is men and women in this body standing up together and saying that enough is enough. That is because these lives are not just Black, not just White, not just Democrat, not just Independent, and not just Republican. They are Americans. They are our children, our seniors, and our neighbors. They are our friends, and they are our colleagues. Wake up. This is not about us against them. This is about us fighting an epidemic. It is an epidemic that is literally killing our community.  {time}  2030  Today, I said to my colleagues across the aisle, do not look away. Come to the table. Work with us. The cost of inaction is measured in lives lost in our neighborhoods, in our classrooms, and in our communities across the country. To my Republican colleagues, do not look away. Do not wait until the next shooting is in your neighborhood. Do not wait until it is your constituent, your relative, your friend, your fraternity brother, your sorority sister, your neighbor, your colleague, your loved one. Mass shooters don't care about your party. They don't care about your socioeconomic status. Unfortunately, they often think of hate based by race, based by who you are, by who you choose to love, by who you choose to worship. This is America, and these are all things that are a part of our strength. Let's not allow them to push us into the corner and fight against each other. We should not live like this. Gun violence is not a political issue. It is a human issue. The time for reform is not tomorrow. The time for reform is not next year. The time for reform is now, and the people who must do it are us. Let's rise to this moment. Let's demonstrate to the American people that while Republicans and Democrats may disagree philosophically on many things, let us agree that gun violence is no way for Americans to have to live. Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, Claudia Quaatey, a 16-year-old who dreamed of becoming a nurse, killed by gun violence. Cecilia Thomas, a 5-month-old, shot and killed in Chicago, a 5-month old. I now yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly)."
"Israel's recent action is appalling and counterproductive, and we strongly oppose the expansion of military operations, settler violence and the blocking of humanitarian aid. We have suspended free trade agreement talks and sanctioned extremists supporting settler expansion in the west bank. It is a long-standing principle that genocide is determined by competent international courts and not by Governments, and we do not sell arms directly to the Israel Defence Forces when that might breach international humanitarian law."
"There have been some incredibly powerful speeches this evening, and I feel really lucky to be participating in the debate. There is a lot to celebrate, but there is an awful lot to be really angry about as well. We owe an enormous amount to the Caribbean and broader black-British community for their contributions to our society, not least the Windrush generation's key role in building the NHS, and in my own region, the black-Caribbean community's role in profoundly shaping Greater Manchester's cultural landscape and social fabric. In 1966, Louise Da-Cocodia became Manchester's first senior nursing officer, having come from Jamaica in 1955. Confronted with relentless racism in her role, she channelled   her experiences into activism, becoming a key anti-racist campaigner, and her legacy continues through the organisations she helped to establish. In 1980, Kath Locke, a pioneering mixed-race community activist, founded the Abasindi Co-operative, a black, women-led community organisation based in the Moss Side people's centre. It offered essential services, including a drop-in centre for the elderly, a community health hub and a Saturday school to tackle educational underachievement and high youth unemployment. In 1991, the NIA centre, now the Playhouse theatre in Hulme, opened as the first large-scale arts venue in Europe dedicated to African and Caribbean culture. Its inaugural event featured none other than the legendary Nina Simone. Today, the Chuck gallery in central Manchester continues that legacy by showcasing and celebrating Afro-Caribbean and African art. It works to foster greater understanding and appreciation of Caribbean artistic perspectives. Here in the UK, far too many people's lives are still blighted by prejudice, discrimination and inequality. Racism is still far too prevalent in our society. We all have a responsibility to recognise that reality, but also to recognise the role that we can play in challenging that injustice. I am proud that the Lib Dems are committed to fighting for racial equality, and that means unequivocally condemning racism in all its forms and tackling injustice wherever we see it. In her opening, very powerful remarks, the hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Helen Hayes) rightly laid out that the previous Government failed to deliver the justice that Windrush victims so deeply deserve. The Government dithered and delayed on implementing the recommendations of Wendy Williams' lessons-learned review. Liberal Democrats will keep pushing the Government."
"I thank the Minister and the members of the Bill Committee for their hard work on this legislation. I regret, however, that the Minister has been so resistant to amendments from my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton and Wellington (Gideon Amos) and from others on the Liberal Democrat Benches, which I now rise to support. My constituents in Bicester and Woodstock want to see a planning system that delivers decent, affordable homes for those excluded from housing, that recognises that investment in infrastructure must come before housing development and that does not create a false distinction between development and protecting nature. Linda and Gary live in my constituency. Gary has complex needs and Linda is his carer. Their property is not suitable; Gary cannot shower or get to the garden by himself. Linda and Gary have been bidding to West Oxfordshire district council for a property suitable to meet Gary's needs for more than a year, but they have been continually unsuccessful. As many hon. Members have stated, we have a crisis of social housing in this country.  That is why Liberal Democrats want to see an additional 150,000 social homes built every year through amendment 15, and why new clause 112 is so important, preventing developers from ducking the delivery of social homes. We also need developers to develop the buildings that have been consented. In Cherwell district council in my constituency, more than 8,000 homes have been consented but not built. That has led to a crisis, with villages such as Ambrosden and Launton at the mercy of opportunist developers who have hoovered up sites not contained in the local plan. New clause 3 would put an end to the land banking of consented sites, forcing developers to use them or lose them. On Second Reading I highlighted to the Secretary of State that there are three nationally significant infrastructure projects proposed in my constituency. These mega-schemes relate to energy and transport. They may bring local benefit, but my constituents are deeply concerned by the way decisions are taken out of the hands of local representatives. They are especially concerned that these NSIPs sit outside local plans, so that their cumulative impact is not considered when other decisions are taken. Amendment 128 would ensure oversight of national policy statements and allow Members of this House to scrutinise the Government's approach to national projects. Local infrastructure is also critical. In my constituency, Bicester, Kidlington and a number of villages anticipate rapid housing growth in the coming years, yet our physical and social infrastructure is already struggling to cope. My constituents want assurance that housing growth will be preceded by sufficient investment in GP surgeries, dentistry and school and college places, as well as water infrastructure, energy capacity and transport networks. New clause 46 would require local infrastructure to be completed, while new clauses 4 and 23 would ensure that water and drainage infrastructure is sufficient for development. The Minister acknowledged in his speech that many organisations and leaders devoted to protecting nature, such as the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust and, I believe, the chief executive of the RSPB, Beccy Speight, are deeply concerned by the way Ministers have characterised measures to address the nature emergency as blockers to development. The Minister disputed that, so it is disappointing that the Government have not accepted new clause 9, which would have had the modest goal of encouraging swift bricks and other measures for wildlife in new developments. I hope he will also reconsider new clause 1, which sets out the Government's principal commitment to take all reasonable steps to avoid adverse environmental effects, and I urge the Government to accept new clause 17, which would ensure a fairer level of community benefit for new energy infrastructure projects. At the same time, this Bill misses an opportunity to raise the environmental standards of new homes. I welcome the Minister's commitment at the weekend that new homes will have solar panels by default, and the tribute he paid to my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Max Wilkinson) for campaigning on that issue. However, I regret that the Government have not accepted new clause 2, which would have set a zero carbon standard for new homes. The Minister and I have frequently discussed the written ministerial statement of December 2023 under the previous Administration, which undermined the effort of West Oxfordshire district council in my constituency to set a low carbon standard for the development of Salt Cross. I appreciate that he may not accept new clause 2, but will he at least agree today to withdraw that written ministerial statement and to release the development of high-quality homes that will be good for the environment and good for their new residents?"
"My hon. Friend is right to highlight the targeting. Setting the means test threshold at PS35,000 ensures that it is well above the income levels of pensioners in poverty and is around the average earnings level. On policy in Scotland, an important principle of devolution is that those are decisions for the Scottish Government, but they are also decisions for which they will be held accountable."
"I refer the House to my declaration in the Register of Members' Financial Interests. Can I push the Secretary of State on the  answer that he gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Dame Caroline Dinenage) about HMS Collingwood? My constituents will look for reassurance that it will have a long-term place in the defence estate. I also ask the Secretary of State about recommendation 40, which says: ""The Royal Navy should explore alternative approaches to augmenting the Royal Fleet Auxiliary to deliver a balanced, cost-effective fleet that maximises the UK's warfighting capabilities."" The RFA is already stretched; I have been on visits to the RFA where it has told me that it is stretched with the operational requirements placed on it. It sounds to me like this is a loss of operational independence. Will the Secretary of State commit to an expansion of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary consisting of ships managed purely by the Royal Navy under the defence estate?"
"The hon. Member will know that the pupil premium is additional funding to improve educational outcomes for disadvantaged pupils in state-funded schools in England. Pupil premium funding will rise to over PS3 billion in 2025-26, an increase of almost 5% from 2024-25. We are reviewing how we allocate pupil premium and the national funding formula deprivation funding in the longer term and, while maintaining the overall amount we spend on tackling challenges faced by children with additional needs, we will provide more information on those matters in due course."
"Mr. Chair, to go back to that question again, I have the same answer. My job is not to select the projects in the national interest. It is to make sure that we protect the environment in making the decisions."
"Madam Speaker, I do agree that interprovincial trade and removing the barriers is a good thing. I do agree that when those barriers are gone, we would be able to create billions of dollars in economic activity right across our country. The issue here now is the fact that the Prime Minister , during the campaign, talked about getting interprovincial free trade done by Canada Day, and the clock is ticking."
"Mr. Chair, again, we are looking backwards. We are trying to look forward. The one Canadian economy act would accelerate the development of projects of national interest. If the Conservatives want—"
"Madam Speaker, it is a question that I had posed to me many times during the recount from folks of all political alignments. I have full faith in the work of Elections Canada. There were elections workers who started very early in the morning and were counting very late at night. Ultimately, it is a human process with many checks and balances. I acknowledge that there were concerns with particular ridings. However, at some point, the work of government needs to proceed. People need to have faith in the electoral process, and their elected representatives need to get to work."
"I thank the Secretary of State and the Aviation Minister for their engagement while bringing forward this legislation. This Bill is vital not only to meet our national climate commitments, but to ensure strong regional economic growth, such as in my constituency of North Somerset, where Bristol airport, a beacon in the UK's transition to sustainable aviation, is located. Bristol airport has long demonstrated real leadership in this space. In March 2021, it became BP's first UK customer to receive a supply of sustainable aviation fuel. In March 2024, nearly a year before the Government's mandate, Jet2 began operating flights from Bristol airport using a blend of sustainable aviation fuel, reducing the emissions that these flights generated by an astounding 70%. In recognition of the airport's leadership in this area, in December this Government made the very wise decision to appoint it to the jet zero taskforce, where it will be able to share its years of experience and expertise with the group. The leadership and vision shown by institutions such as Bristol airport are not just laudable, but necessary, if we are to reach net zero by 2050. Aviation has been a domestic economic success story in recent decades. It now contributes PS40 billion to the UK economy annually, including PS20 billion in exports, and supports over half a million jobs across the country. With over 60% of the Members of this House having 500 or more constituents who work in aerospace, aviation or the wider supply chain, I will not be alone in recognising how vital it is for the economic future of our country to ensure that this industry remains a success. However, the ugly truth is that the sector accounts for around 7% of the UK's total emissions, and if we are to decarbonise the aviation industry while ensuring that flying remains affordable  and accessible, it is to innovations such as sustainable aviation fuels and hydrogen in aviation that we must turn. As the sustainable aviation fuel mandate begins to ramp up demand in the years to come, domestic production will sadly continue to lag behind, so this Bill's revenue certainty mechanism is essential. Learning from the success that contracts for difference have led to for renewables, the revenue certainty mechanism will unlock the UK's production by providing certainty for investors, and could see up to 60,000 skilled and well-paid jobs created by 2050. My constituents in North Somerset will welcome the news that the Government continue to balance the need to support regional economic growth with meeting our net zero commitments, and I look forward to seeing the local jobs and cleaner skies that this Bill will deliver in the years to come."
"Mr. Speaker, the minister wants to pretend all is going well, but the facts from his own department show that first-time homebuyers are struggling, as 60% “have had difficulties maintaining debt payments.” That is not all. Recently, TD Bank has cast doubt on the Liberal promise to build more homes, stating that new home starts are actually going to decline next year. When housing starts go down, the prices go up, and we have yet another failed Liberal promise. I will ask this again: On what date will we see a federal budget that includes a plan for housing so Canadians can afford a home?"
"The approach of the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation flies in the face of every established principle of humane and effective aid delivery, as has become quickly apparent. The head of the organisation has resigned and at least 42 Palestinians have been killed--killed--for simply trying to feed their starving families. That is an affront to all of us and to the basic principles of human dignity and respect. Does the Minister agree that there has to be full accountability for these atrocities?"
"I rise to present a petition, alongside a corresponding online petition, signed by hundreds of my constituents in North East Hertfordshire, demanding a planning system that puts people and nature before profit. The root cause of the housing crisis is the flawed developer-led model that fails to deliver affordable homes and manufactures a false conflict between housing and nature. The Government must put councils back in the driving seat, with the funding and tools to build genuinely affordable homes within sustainable communities. The petitioners therefore request ""that the House of Commons urge the Government to reform the Planning and Infrastructure Bill so it delivers for both workers and wildlife, redefining affordable housing based on local incomes, ensuring developers deliver on their housing promises, protects irreplaceable habitat like Chalk Streams and upholds local democracy in the planning system."" Following is the full text of the petition: [The petition of residents of the United Kingdom, Declares that the planning system should put people and nature before profit. The petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urge the Government to reform the Planning and Infrastructure Bill so it delivers for both workers and wildlife, redefining affordable housing based on local incomes, ensuring developers deliver on their housing promises, protects irreplaceable habitat like Chalk Streams and upholds local democracy in the planning system. And the petitioners remain, etc.] [P003081]"
"today I have the distinct honor of recognizing Chris McGuiness of Polson, MT, for his selfless and unwavering commitment to the safety of his community. Mr. McGuiness is renowned by his peers as being the epitome of a genuine volunteer. While maintaining a full-time engineering job and volunteering with local organizations, Mr. McGuiness has dedicated up to 15 hours a week volunteering with the Polson Fire Department for the past 25 years. During his time with Polson FD, McGuiness earned the title of captain and is consistently commended for his hard work and dedication to the department. In addition to his time spent volunteering with the Polson Fire Department, McGuiness also volunteers for the Polson Rural Fire Department Search and Rescue and with the Polson High School tennis team. McGuiness finds joy in helping others; from responding to emergency calls to his day-to-day life around town, he is constantly inspiring others to service. Volunteers are the backbone of many smalltown and rural communities around Montana. Often, our volunteers are overlooked and not thanked enough for all that they do to support the organizations that keep our communities thriving. It is the generosity and kindness of people like Mr. McGuiness that Montana became known as the Last Best Place. I am pleased and honored to recognize Polson Volunteer Fire Captain Chris McGuiness for his steadfast commitment to his community. I am confident that your dedication to serving others has not only inspired those around you but is making a truly positive impact on the people of Polson. You make Montana Proud."
"Mr. Chair, I am buoyed by this interest in “build Canada homes”. Certainly, on this side of the House, we want to make sure this effort is quick and nimble. We are focused on building these affordable homes as soon as possible, using all the tools of government."
Is it UK Government policy to pursue regime change in Iran--yes or no?
"The Minister has laid out with some passion the dystopian hell that Gaza has become and the unfolding and ongoing disaster in the west bank. Why, then, as many Members have asked, has he done the absolute bare minimum? We all know in this House, after the previous rounds of sanctions, that there will be absolutely no difference on the ground for the Palestinians. I said last week--I am sorry to be cynical about it--that I thought the House was being played. My confident prediction now, given this announcement, is that recognition, which was being advertised for the conference next week, is off the table. Can the Minister tell me that I am wrong?"
The hon. member.
"Once again, it is a great honour to speak about the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill. Today, we are focused on the amendments proposed following the Public Bill Committee, on which, in common with the right hon. Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Holden), I was honoured to serve; I was the resident metrologist. In Committee, we heard extensively from Members of the Opposition. They described in great depth their concerns about the Bill's implications for international alignment of regulations; we have just heard some of those concerns from the hon. and learned Member for North Antrim (Jim Allister). Today, those concerns have once again been presented to the House through various amendments to the Bill. I will explain, with reference to state-of-the-art metrology, why those issues should not be a significant cause for concern for right hon. and hon. Members."
"My hon. Friend makes a powerful case on behalf of her constituent. New clause 15 is a compassionate and practical clause, ensuring that the Bill works not only for the individual making the choice, but for the families they leave behind. Let us not turn our backs on people like Anthony and Louise; let us not make criminals out of the compassionate. The death of a loved one is always difficult. When someone has gone through the legal and safeguarded process of assisted dying, it is not right that their family should face an unnecessary, potentially lengthy and distressing coroner's investigation."
"I thank the hon. Member for Ashfield (Lee Anderson) for securing this debate, and I welcome the opportunity to set out the Government's position on the BCSSS. There are a lot of hon. Members in attendance. Many have long associations with the coalfield communities they represent, and I know that this is an incredibly important issue to many people across the country. It is also a matter of great importance to me, and I am pleased to be speaking to the House following a meeting I had with the BCSSS trustees this afternoon."
"Mr. Speaker, since this is the first time I am speaking in this new Parliament, I will take the opportunity to say a few thank yous. I have had the privilege and honour of representing the people of Laurentides—Labelle since 2019. This is my third term. First, I want to thank the 23,615 people who chose the Bloc Québécois. To all the others, as I said during the election campaign, I want them to know that I am there for and with them. I also want to thank my campaign team. I will take the time to mention them by name because their contribution was so valuable. They gave a great deal of their time. I want to thank Maryse, Samuel, Annie‑Claude, Annie, François, Michel and Lévis. I seriously would not be here without them. I covered 11,000 kilometres in 39 municipalities. Laurentides—Labelle is a very large but very beautiful riding. I want to thank all these volunteers. All of this already makes me feel very constructive. I am pleased to rise today to speak to the motion put forward by the Conservatives on their opposition day. I am going to break down the motion. I will begin by quickly explaining the essence of this motion. Then I will outline why the Bloc Québécois supports it. Obviously, this motion raises important questions about accountability and governance. I will also provide details. My colleague from Berthier—Maskinongé has already set the stage, so I will try not to be too repetitive. First of all, it is true that families will pay more for their food. In fact, this has already been the case for some time. It is perfectly reasonable to be concerned about this issue, given that families' grocery bills are expected to increase by $800 a year. I think that all parliamentarians have noticed the increase in the price of groceries. In addition, there has been a marked increase in demand at all food banks. I want to bring my colleagues' attention to a particular point in the motion, the one that states that the House should call on the government to present a budget before the summer. Summer starts on June 21, although it could also happen after that date. This budget is supposed to reverse Liberal inflationary policies so Canadians can afford to put food on the table. I have reread the motion several times. The first part is essential. It calls on the government to present a budget. I worked in community organizations for over two decades, and I am also an entrepreneur. Spending money without first identifying our revenue sources is simply not an option. Come on. That part caught my attention, and I wondered whether no budget was being presented because there was not enough time or because this new role came as a surprise. However, the Prime Minister is supposedly a world-renowned expert. Parliamentarians thought they were coming back to the House quickly so that the government could present an economic statement or a budget for them to vote on, but that is not the case. The government was trying to make itself look good. Parliamentarians returned quickly. However, the government was not ready. What should be done in such a situation? We should take our time. This might take a week or two. In any case, as of March 14, the first day the finance minister took office, he knew that he needed to immediately start thinking about what he would propose. There are 343 members in this minority House, and the government is accountable to them. The government is trying to make itself look good. It is talking to the media and announcing goodies like tax cuts, help for first-time homebuyers and all sorts of other things. Parliamentarians agree that anyone who has to put a budget together should have a full breakdown of their cash flow, so that they know exactly how much money is coming in and how much is going out. What we have here is the other extreme. I say this to everyone in Laurentides—Labelle. When I tell them that we are talking about tax measures and that we will agree with this motion because there is indeed an inflationary crisis, constituents ask me what we are working with. I tell them that we are working with nothing. When I talk to colleagues who are economists and accountants and to business people, they tell me that they do not understand why a self-respecting government is not even able to do the basics. I would have expected us to come back a month later than we did and sit until the end of July so that we would be ready to start again. As my colleague said earlier, the committees are not even sitting and cannot conduct any studies. I am lost for words. I just do not get it. Speaking of committees, I will be taking on new responsibilities in that area. I will be working on tourism and veterans' affairs. I will also be working on government operations as a member of the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates. This committee is responsible for analyzing costs. It is fortuitous that we have not started yet. Government spending on equipment purchases is rising from $3.7 billion to $10.8 billion, an increase of 190%. I find that very disconcerting. Governing with billions of dollars is nothing new. I therefore agree with my Conservative colleagues that a budget needs be presented, and quickly. That is the first thing I wanted to say. Furthermore, it has been six months since the House last sat. As I said, as of March 14, we expected to have something tangible to work on when we returned to the House. Instead, we are being presented with a bill called Bill C‑4 , which contains tax measures. However, we do not know how we can work on spending and approve it. The government is putting the screws on us, saying that surely we cannot oppose these measures, since they are intended to help people. To me, that is unacceptable. I want to conclude by saying that Bloc Québécois members are really here to work for our people. We are not here to poll higher, get re-elected and keep our voters in line as of day one in office. We have already taken action. My colleague talked about this earlier. The Institut de recherche en économie contemporaine, or IREC, conducted a study. Everyone says that groceries are expensive, but we all know why. It is because of climate change. Here is an example. I did some gardening this weekend. I can make plans based on the weather. If there is torrential rain, I will protect the garden. If there is a chance of frost in July, I will protect it. If the weather is too dry, I will water it. How well equipped are our producers to adapt to climate change? Basically, life is about supply and demand. If the supply is lacking, obviously things will cost more. The Conservatives care a lot about public safety, but I would suggest that food security is part of that as well, so let us tackle the root of the problem. We know that abolishing the carbon tax has done nothing to bring down the cost of groceries."
"I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way, particularly as it sounds as though he is coming to his conclusion, but I want to give him the best possible chance to talk about new clause 115. My constituency of Surrey Heath is made up of small villages divided by green-belt land and Ministry of Defence property. Without the protections afforded by new clause 115, I fear that the distinctiveness and sense of place of those villages will be gradually lost. Can he comment on how new clause 115 would protect the distinctiveness of place?"
"Our objective here is as it always has been, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend and others for all their engagement with us. We are making these changes because we have to both get more people who can work into work and try to begin to focus this really important benefit on those with higher needs so that it is sustainable for the future. That will not affect existing PIP claimants, who will have their incomes protected; that is a very positive change that we are making. The Timms review will look at those descriptors and the points that are allocated as part of a much wider assessment, because we have to ensure that this benefit lasts for the future so that it is always there for those in greatest need."
The terms of reference will be set out in due course. We have not yet appointed or determined the chair for the national inquiry. We will do so and set that out for the House. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's response on the issue of the national apology for the historical and current challenges that have led to victims being let down over very many years. I think his response echoes the way in which the whole House came together in 2022 around similar support for victims.
"Oh, oh!"
No. Members will be voting for reforms to open up opportunities for people who have been denied opportunities for far too long. We are putting that right.
"Resuming debate, the hon. member for Beloeil—Chambly."
"My hon. Friend is being most generous with his time, and I thank him for securing this really important debate. There is a busy bridge on the A171 in my constituency, which is used by pupils in years 7 and 8 based at the Airy Hill site of Whitby School, as well as the parents and pupils who attend Airy Hill primary school and tourists photographing the steam trains that can be seen below. It is a very noisy and windy bridge with heavy road and foot traffic, and it is high above the estuary. Despite that, there are no zebra crossings or raised kerbs, and the speed limit is 40 mph. Understandably, local residents are really worried. They have tried to lower the speed limit to 30 mph, but North Yorkshire council is not interested, so they have raised a petition themselves. Does my hon. Friend agree that this is exactly why parish and town councils should be given road safety powers, including the ability to introduce speed limits?"
"This House has heard many personal stories over the course of the Bill. Seeing a loved one die a long, protracted death is not an experience that I would wish on anybody, but once it has happened to you, the memory never fades. There are many important technical, legal and medical aspects of the Bill that are essential to ensure that it operates in the safest way possible, but supporting the principle of personal agency over a dignified death comes from the heart and from the personal experiences of each and every one of us. I am aware that the Scottish Parliament has its own legislation in progress on this very difficult issue, but I wish to share my own story with the House to help in the decision that it must take. My brother David was 52 years old when he arrived at work one day and the manager on the shop floor told him that he looked pale. He had worked a tough, physical job for 30 years and was a strong, full-of-life man. His manager was so concerned at David's pallor that he took him straight to the hospital. After two weeks in hospital, he was given the devastating diagnosis of an advanced stage of pancreatic cancer. Over the next 18 months, David tried everything he could to stay alive. However, after an unsuccessful operation to try and remove the cancer, and taking part in trials for new drugs, he slowly began to lose mobility. The last few months of his life were lived at home in a hospital bed. The strength and resilience of his wife, Jackie, to take care of him day in, day out remains an inspiration to me. As David's health declined, his painkillers were increased further and further. His painkillers became so strong that he could no longer speak, and we did not know if he could hear us. His body became skeletal and his speech gradually disappeared. In one of the last times when he still was able to speak, he called out to me from his bed and told me that if there was a pill that he could take to end his life, he would very much like to take it. David would suffer in silent pain for a further three weeks. He could never have known that I would ever have the opportunity to stand in this place and ask colleagues to make sure that others do not go through what he went through. I have done right by my brother by speaking here today. What David needed was a humane, safe and trusting process available to him at home that would give him agency over his last weeks and months. That is what this Bill offers. That is the choice that this House is finally today in a position to give to those suffering from a terminal illness, and I commend the Bill to the House."
"I offer my amendment to prevent the President and the Vice President from using their public office for personal enrichment. Donald Trump has already benefited enormously from his ability to issue stablecoins, as everybody in the world knows. His World Liberty Financial, in which he and his family have an overwhelming stake, issued a stablecoin just the other month. This stablecoin was chosen by companies throughout the Middle East to facilitate a $2 billion investment in Binance. The President's company will now reap interest in trading fees on billions of dollars while also raising concerns about undue influence and our national security. We shouldn't have to wonder if the President of the United States is favoring the interests of a foreign nation or a private crypto exchange like Binance because he stands to personally profit.  While this amendment specifically addresses the issuance and endorsement of stablecoins, I believe this prohibition should extend to all digital assets, including the President's meme coin. In other words, I believe the President and the Vice President and everybody who is a Member of this body and in the House of Representatives should not be in the business of speculating and issuing cryptocurrency-- stablecoins, meme coins, any of them. The Senate should not continue with the GENIUS Act unless the opportunities for corruption and conflict of interest on the part of executives are fully addressed.  Boulder, Colorado Attack"
Order. I do not think this is relevant to sun tanning. Let us move on.
"the voting machine did not register the vote. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 146."
"Does my hon. Friend recognise the value that development corporations have brought to new towns such as Harlow? New towns are a great example of where we can have affordable housing but also the environmental aspect, with green fingers and green wedges."
"Will the Government publish a list of sectors considered overly dependent on Chinese input, starting with critical minerals and clean energy components, to promote transparency? Will the Foreign Secretary outline any clear Government targets for reducing those dependencies?"
"Will my hon. Friend join me in congratulating the community in north Taunton on getting the first No. 1 bus of the morning--the 6.22 am service--restored? I had the joy of experiencing it this morning, tinged only with the tiredness that results from having got the 6.22. Does he agree that we need specific funding so that bus services can properly connect with hospitals, such as Taunton's Musgrove Park hospital and many others?"
"We welcome investment in warm homes following a winter in which millions of households were living in fuel poverty. The crisis was exacerbated by the Government's cut to winter fuel payments-- and we welcome the U-turn on that,  too. The former Conservative Government's stop-starts on home insulation policies left thousands of vulnerable people in damp, cold and unsafe homes, with lower energy-efficiency standards and higher bills during an energy crisis. Given that homes in this country are among the oldest and least energy-efficient in Europe, will the Government commit to an ambitious 10-year plan for home insulation, for which the Liberal Democrats have long called? Will they ensure that households on lower incomes will be eligible for free insulation as part of that plan? And, following the Government accepting the campaign of my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Max Wilkinson) for solar panels to be mandated for all new homes, will they now look to introduce a full zero carbon standard for all new homes and solar for car parks, as put forward by the Liberal Democrats in amendments to the Planning and Infra- structure Bill?"
"I am confused. If the individuals in question have done something so bad that they have to be deprived of their citizenship, why would we not simply jail them? Why would we need to deprive them of their citizenship?"
"I thank my friend from Kentucky for yielding. Mr. Speaker, a little over a week ago, America witnessed a horrific act of political violence that goes against everything the United States stands for. On June 14, a deranged murderer disguised himself as a police officer to gain entry into the home of Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman. He shot the senator and his wife, Yvette, a combined total of 17 times as Yvette shielded her daughter, Hope, who then called 911. Thankfully, Yvette Hoffman has been released from the hospital while John remains in serious but stable condition. He remains in our prayers. The killer, still disguised as a law enforcement officer, then stopped at the homes of two other Minnesota lawmakers, one whom was fortunately not home, and the other who was perhaps saved by a timely law enforcement intervention. He later arrived at the home of Minnesota State House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and assassinated her and her husband, Mark Hortman. Law enforcement then led a 2-day manhunt before capturing the killer and finding a list of more than 45 lawmakers and potential targets. As someone who has experienced political violence firsthand, this brings back a lot of emotions. The man who shot me on the ball field that day also had a list of lawmakers. I am grateful for the actions of the brave law enforcement officers who ran toward the danger and saved lives on the ball field that day and saved no doubt many lives in Minnesota on that day just a few days ago. This was a methodically planned attack on the people's right to be governed by their duly-elected Representatives and should be universally condemned, Mr. Speaker. America's differences must be resolved through debate and democracy, not through violence. The resolution we are voting on today denounces these disturbing and anti-American attacks and mourns the tragic loss of Melissa and Mark Hortman.  {time}  1515  H. Res. 519, introduced by the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Morrison), unequivocally condemns the horrific attacks on Minnesota lawmakers and their families in Brooklyn Park and Champlin, Minnesota, and calls for the rejection of political violence in Minnesota and throughout the United States. Political violence will never have a place in America. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle must unite to reject political violence in all forms across the country. Melissa Hortman was a dedicated public servant, and we join Minnesota and the Nation in honoring her life and the life of her husband, Mark. We also pray for the speedy recovery of John and Yvette Hoffman and for peace and unity in the face of tragedy and division. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the resolution."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member opposite mentioned “the new government” again."
"Mr. Chair, the Government of Canada remains committed to resolving outstanding pay issues while modernizing the public service."
"The hon. Member raises an important point, and we did inherit an unacceptable asylum backlog, including huge and unacceptable bills for asylum accommodation. We have already brought the bills for asylum accommodation down, saving hundreds of millions of pounds, with hundreds of millions of pounds more to be saved over the course of this year. That is a result of the action we are taking to clear the backlog that the previous Government left us with, and as part of that we are working with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government on how to co-ordinate support for local councils."
"Mr. Chair, I am certainly looking forward to speeding this process up. The idea with “build Canada homes” is that all the different departments and agencies of government are working in unison to deliver affordable housing across the country, leveraging federal land."
"The House resumed consideration of the motion, as amended, for an address to His Majesty the King in reply to his speech at the opening of the session."
"Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Terra Nova—The Peninsulas gave an inspiring speech. The member mentioned the importance of ferries. His riding and mine are at opposite ends of the country, but they have this in common: We are coastal provinces, where ferries for passengers and traffic are very important. However, in British Columbia, we are not even building our own ferries. I wonder if the member could comment on the importance of one strong Canadian economy to be able to at least build our own ships."
"Mr. Speaker, just to clarify, did the minister not read the report?"
"Mr. Speaker, if the Liberals truly cared about fairness and cared about fixing their legislation, they would clear the backlog that real immigrants are facing right now, instead of turning the bill and this opportunity into a vanity ideological project."
"I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith). Madam Speaker, it is an honor to follow some of our Chamber's most distinguished colleagues, including Speaker   Mike Johnson, on the anniversary of this historic day. Three years ago today, on June 24, 2022, our Supreme Court issued its ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson. Their decision overturned Roe v. Wade and restored the right of each State, including my home State of Indiana, to protect the lives of the unborn. Today, we reaffirm the sanctity of human life, both mother and child. I join my House colleagues in introducing legislation to designate June as Life Month. I have prioritized this issue in my time in Congress, and I will continue to advocate for every unborn child and offer compassionate care for expectant mothers."
"Mr. Chair, again, I have been in this seat for about three and a half weeks. I think the questions being posed on the other side are either totally misplaced or they are wrong."
"Mr. Chair, does the minister agree that regional connections are at the heart of Via Rail's mandate?"
"I thank the Chair of the Justice Committee, the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Chiswick (Andy Slaughter), working with the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Linsey Farnsworth), for making the pitch to the Backbench Business Committee to secure this debate. I join him in thanking the incredible staff who work across our criminal justice system. If I may, I will add that charities such as the incredible abandofbrothers in Eastbourne work with young ex-offenders across my hometown to tackle crime. As has been documented in this Chamber today, the last Government left our criminal justice system in a state. Our prisons were left in crisis and overcrowded, with increases in violence and self-harm incidents at their highest since records began. Our probation services were left high and dry, with an electronic tagging contract that left offenders with violent convictions unmonitored for far too long. Our courts were left dealing with staggeringly high backlogs, with tens of thousands of  open cases and victims waiting months and even years for justice. As has been mentioned by hon. Members, reoffending is through the roof, with 80% of people in our prisons being reoffenders. That is a symbol of more crime, more victims and more misery and harm. That carries an enormous price tag, with reoffending costing society more than PS18 billion a year. The consequences of that dire set of circumstances have been plain for us all to see; I saw them myself when I worked in this space before being elected to this House. I spent my career supporting young ex-offenders out of crime and out of gangs in the east end--very far from Eastbourne in many different ways. I remember working with a particular young person. I said to him ahead of his first day of work with us to come in wearing some smart trousers, and he did not know what I meant. He said, ""Josh, do you mean court trousers?"" What a sad state of affairs it is when a young person in our country has grown up more accustomed to the criminal justice system than to our education system. I am afraid that is a legacy of the last Government. I remember working with another young person who went into a young offenders' institution that was notorious for its issues with violence. He was working with us as a phone repair technician before he went in. He came back when he came out of that institution, except he came missing a finger as a result of some of the things going on in that place. Again, some of our institutions are out of control. As a victim, I have experienced what it is like to wait for years to have a case heard through an adversarial criminal justice system that seeks to beat down victims, as opposed to supporting them to rise up. That needs to change. Giving credit where it is due, I welcome the investment that this Government are making in our criminal justice systems through the spending review, but that investment is not a silver bullet, and it might not go far enough to right the wrongs of the past: it must be accompanied by reform. There is no mention in the spending review specifically of investing in our crumbling courts, which cause so much inefficiency and cost our system, victims and justice. As the hon. Member for Solihull West and Shirley (Dr Shastri-Hurst) mentioned earlier in the debate, the Magistrates' Association has been particularly concerned about the lack of mention of funding for legal advisers in magistrates courts. The lack thereof is resulting in one in 10 sittings being cancelled. While investment in creating new prison places has been announced, the spending review features no reference to extra funding for women's centres--an alternative to custody--despite David Gauke recommending that in his independent review and charities such as Working Chance telling us that women's centres are often at least 10 times more effective at reducing reoffending and are more cost-effective than the prison system. Although we welcome the PS700 million committed to the Probation Service, it is critical, as per the demands of Women's Aid, that some of that cash goes towards mandatory training for probation officers as far as recognising domestic abuse and protecting survivors of domestic abuse is concerned."
"over the weekend, the world once again witnessed a shocking act of terrorism committed against innocent civilians in Syria. Those who attended Sunday mass at the Mar Elias Church were not combatants. They were members of the community who sought to live in peace andrebuild from war. They were members of our community who had endured unimaginable suffering and faced an uncertain future with faith and hope. In the shadow of relentless terror and violence, it takes enormous courage to do many of the things that we take for granted. We can take inspiration from those who face down the cowardly perpetrators of destruction with faith and hope as they work to rebuild their nation. I join the Greater Lehigh Valley Syrian community in praying for the victims of this attack and for peace to return to Syria. May God bless all of those who stand up in the face of terror and violence."
"Mr. Speaker, how many jobs will be lost because of Liberal inaction?"
"I rise today to recognize Kai Weiss for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award. Kai has overcome many challenges along his journey to success, demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make the most of their education, like Kai, develop crucial skills and a work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This award is a testament to Kai's hard work, determination, and perseverance at Three Creeks K-8 and is clearly just the beginning of a bright and promising future. It is my honor to congratulate Kai Weiss on achieving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award."
"My right hon. Friend is right to put on record our thanks to former EU High Representative Baroness Ashton for all her work to get the JCPOA agreement. The previous Government and successive leaders of the Conservative party also worked to secure that agreement. It is hugely important that we get back to diplomacy. It is right to say, though, that the assessment of the IAEA is that there has been deception from the Iranian regime. How do you account for having stockpiles that are 40 times over what they should be, if you were sticking to the agreement? That is why we must come together, yes, calling for restraint, but we do need diplomatic action. Iran cannot have nuclear capability, full stop."
"With this it will be convenient to discuss: Lords amendments 2 and 3, Government motions to disagree, and Government amendment (a) in lieu. Lords amendments 4 to 7."
"Mr. Speaker, since I have been in the House of Commons, I have heard several Liberals and Conservatives say how proud they are to represent their Quebec constituents in the House. They thanked their constituents. However, I no longer hear this when it comes to defending Quebeckers on financial and other matters and making the voice of Quebec and this nation heard on issues that they believe are important, such as a healthy environment. The people of Quebec have developed through renewable energy. They have freed themselves from having to depend on international markets for heating. I think that we should be proud of this. We should be proud of what has been done. Quebec has positioned itself as a leader in the fight against climate change compared to many other states. It is a carbon market pioneer. We must seriously commit to the Paris Agreement and participate in the global effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the face of a climate crisis that is hitting almost every corner of the planet, as we are seeing again today with the forest fires. Canada was a little behind, and in some respects, it decided to join the global trend by putting a price on carbon. However, in a blatant attempt to win votes, the new Liberal leader decided to abolish federal consumer carbon pricing by signing an order in council on March 14. Then the election was called. Ten days later, on March 23, the carbon tax was officially abolished. On April 1, in the midst of the election campaign, there was no longer a price on carbon. However, we know why the Liberal leader at the time decided to do away with a climate policy that he originally said was important to his party. Many Liberals said that it was a good policy. The Liberal leader at the time even denied the work of his colleagues, such as the former environment minister, the current member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie , who said it was a good policy. Why did he do that? It is basically because the Conservative leader had been hammering away at the public for three years with slogans about axing the carbon tax. The Conservatives tried to demonize it in the public eye. Obviously, they wanted to take advantage of the electoral momentum. The strategy that we deplored, of course, was when the Liberal leader decided to axe this tax. Yes, the Liberals did away with those environmental policies in response to pressure from the Conservatives. However, Ottawa decided to still issue a rebate for a tax that had been abolished, with the last payment going out on April 22. Oddly enough, on April 22, the election campaign was in full swing. It is important to understand that this tax was supposed to be paid. The rebate was supposed to cover what Canadians would be charged in the following three months. All Canadians, except Quebeckers and British Columbians, received cheques, which were sent out in the midst of the election campaign. It is simple. We call that giving out election goodies. The cost was $3.7 billion. It was not funded by the proceeds from the oil and gas levy. It was funded directly from the government coffers. The cheques sent to Canadians ranged from about $220 to $456 per family. That $3.7 billion came out of the government coffers. It belongs to all taxpayers, including Quebeckers. Quebeckers paid for this election gift and did not get so much as a penny in return. In Quebec, we paid for this, but we got nothing. The Liberal government gave an election gift to the rest of Canada at Quebeckers' expense. I think that the situation is very clear. It is unacceptable. It is an injustice. Among other things, we are paying for the responsibilities of provinces that have not done their part. Quebec is responsible enough to have a carbon exchange with California and other states that are taking the climate crisis seriously. As we can now see, this crisis is not imaginary. It is hitting western Canada with forest fires, the smoke from which has spread as far as England. That $814 million was taken from the pockets of Quebeckers to send cheques to Canadians. That is $814 million that will not be invested in health, education, child care, public transit or the fight against climate change, when those needs are urgent. Everyone knows that. All the parties in the Quebec National Assembly agree. They adopted a motion calling on all the federal parties to commit to returning to Quebeckers, without conditions, the $814 million that was taken from their pockets. That money belongs to them. How did the new Prime Minister respond to this demand from the Quebec National Assembly? He said that Quebec had chosen a different system, that this system is still in place and that this final payment would apply only to the rest of Canada. Let us tell it like it is: This is nonsense. He refuses to acknowledge the very simple fact that the final cheque was not paid by the rest of Canada, as he claims, but that it was paid by all taxpayers. His argument is flawed. It does not hold water. We have been demonstrating this since this morning and we will continue to do so throughout the day in the hope that parliamentarians will listen to reason. Our motion gives the government and all parties an opportunity to correct the situation, to be on the right side of history, and to respond appropriately to the Quebec National Assembly's unanimous request to resolve this injustice. Beyond this specific injustice, we must recall the broader implications of eliminating this important part of carbon pricing in Canada. It does not augur well for the fight against climate change. We have seen this since the new government took office. Unfortunately, Canada is not on track to meet its international commitments. We are not the ones saying that eliminating carbon pricing was a bad idea; it is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the OECD. The federal government, including Prime Minister Trudeau and his ministers, often said that it was a good policy for most Canadians and that close to 80% of people got back more than what they paid, especially low- and middle-income households. Even the Parliamentary Budget Officer acknowledged this, and he was very clear about it. Unfortunately, the Liberals did not defend their policy well. They were unable to make people understand the urgency of the climate crisis, to stand up and implement policies to meet that challenge. Now, Quebeckers are the ones who are paying the price for their mistakes. It is a political decision, and it is clear that there has been no change in the Canadian oil monarchy's current goal of producing and exporting as much oil from the oil sands as possible. Unfortunately, the Liberals and the Conservatives, of course, like to confuse the interests of Canadian oil companies with Canada's national interests, but we have to be careful not to confuse them with Quebec's national interests, which are definitely not the interests of oil companies. Despite the fact that Canada is the world's fourth-largest oil and gas producer, in Quebec, we have decided to move away from oil and gas, and we are being penalized for that right now. It is costing Quebeckers $814 million because we are standing up and taking this climate crisis seriously. A choice has to be made. We are talking about climate justice and financial injustice. Here in the House, it is clear that the government is defending the oil and gas lobby. Now, we expect it to defend the interests and wallets of Quebeckers. The government needs to rebuild trust. It is a matter of justice and fairness for Quebeckers. We are hoping for a positive response from our colleagues to the unanimous request of elected representatives of the Quebec National Assembly. The message could not be clearer. Remedying this situation would certainly be a good starting point. We would be glad to discuss the policies that this government should or should not introduce if it seriously wants to fight climate change. Today, however, it is important that members of the House support this motion to require the federal government to remedy the situation. We, in the House, cannot accept that election goodies intended to directly influence an election and assist in electing a government should be paid for out of taxpayers' pockets, especially not the pockets of Quebeckers. In short, this is about defending the national interest and climate justice. The parties would send a clear message if they did the right thing and supported our motion. We are talking here about public funds that were used in a discriminatory manner for electoral purposes, and I think a red line was crossed. The least we can do is discuss the matter, but the most important thing is for members to vote in favour of this motion today."
"The Labour party is defined by work and by the dignity of work, and so is my community in Gateshead and Whickham. People have the belief that they should be able to work to provide for themselves, their family and their community, but too many in my community have been let down by successive Governments of all parties who have not created the jobs we need and by a failed system. Not one person who has spoken today--not one--has defended the existing indefensible system. What will the Secretary of State do to ensure that communities like mine, where work or a lack of work is the problem, receive the support we need?"
"Mr. Speaker, allow me to congratulate you on your appointment to the position of Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. I have had the pleasure of knowing you for almost 10 years, and I know you will do a great job. I would also like to congratulate my colleague from the Quebec City region on his election and on the quality of his speech. Obviously, I agree with him that we are here for our children. I have always said that we are in politics because of our parents. We inherit what our parents gave us. We are here to leave Canada in a better place for our children, our grandchildren, which I am blessed to have, and our great-grandchildren to come. The member was elected in the Quebec City region as someone with a background in the chamber of commerce, as a businessman and as someone who knows how to count. Could the member explain why his government refuses to table a budget? Let me be clear. On February 4, the former minister of finance said he was preparing a budget. The current Prime Minister and the current Minister of Finance have been in office since mid-March. During the election campaign, the Minister of Finance suspended his campaign—"
"First, I thank the shadow Home Secretary for his tone, and for putting the survivors and victims at the heart of his question. It is absolutely right that we all look at what has happened over the last couple of decades, and at the countless reports that we have had, and look to implement them. He is right to talk about the confidence that people must have in the independent inquiry. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary spoke about that earlier this week in relation to Baroness Casey's report, which we will take forward at speed. The inquiry will be independent, and it will have statutory powers. We will also implement the Jay report, which he will have known about, as the Minister in charge at the time. We will get on with taking action. I hope Conservative Members will adopt his tone, so that we can make sure that the whole House puts victims first, and that we all work together to get to the bottom of this."
"We have been here nearly every week talking about these issues. The sanctions are welcome, but every speaker is sending the Minister the clear message that we should recognise the state of Palestine. If we do not recognise the state of Palestine, there will be no Palestine to recognise. My question is this: what is preventing that  recognition from happening, especially given that the UK is among 50 countries that do not recognise Palestine? Do we need the permission of Netanyahu or any member of his Government to recognise it? If not, and if we are independent in making this decision, it should have been made long ago."
"It is important to say that internet banking is not going away. These two ideas--face-to-face banking and internet banking--should be two sides of the same coin. All our high street banks should recognise that they have a responsibility to both ways of working. I prefer to bank online because I am busy and spend half my life on trains, but there are people who do not have that luxury, as they are technologically reluctant to engage. I hear many people ask the Government, ""What can we do to get more banking hubs? What can we do to encourage more physical banks?"" That is something that I would support, particularly for towns such as Burntwood, where bringing those banks back could be that spark of regeneration--the thing that starts to reverse that unvirtuous circle, so that it becomes a virtuous circle, where those banks are present and they drive footfall: it is easier to get cash, easier for businesses to bank there and easier for the high street to come back. We all know that the high street is the physical representation of how people feel the economy is going. One reason people are so worried about the economy is that our high streets have been failing for decades. Governments have not supported high streets for far too long, and I am proud that this Government are saying that they will now do so. Getting banks back on to the high street, where they belong, can be that first step for towns such as Burntwood and the others that we have heard about in today's debate."
"The Health Secretary has rightly described Norfolk as ""the Sahara of dental deserts""--[Official Report, 23 July 2024; Vol. 506.] I very much welcome the 700,000 extra dentistry appointments since Labour took office, as well as the money for supervised toothbrushing, but East Anglia is the only region of England without a dental school, and consequently it struggles to recruit and retain dentists. Would the Leader of the House support a general debate on dental care so that we can discuss funding for dentistry schools, and what more can be done to improve access to dentistry across the UK?"
"For far too long, families across my county of Staffordshire, and indeed across the country, have been failed by the very system that was meant to support them. The breadth and depth of the crisis in SEND provision is such that this has to be one of the most, if not the most, frequently debated topics since the general election. Since becoming an MP, I have spoken with dozens of parents who are forced to travel long distances, often across county borders, just to get their child the support to which they are legally entitled. Recently, my team helped a family who had been waiting nine months to get into the school of their choice; others have been waiting for years. I have heard stories of poor communication, of documents being illegible to parents, who feel like outsiders navigating a system designed to exclude them, and of families having to repeat their stories multiple times due to layers and layers of decision making."
"Mr. Speaker, once again, what we have right now is a bill introduced in the House that we can debate and vote on. It is about determining how we are going to come together as a country and choose projects of national interest. When a decision like that has to be made, one of the factors to consider is how those projects will contribute to—"
The hon. member.
"Mr. Chair, again, I was clear. Part of the work of removing barriers to interprovincial trade absolutely includes making services frictionless and barrier-free, and allowing them to be provided across the country."
"Yes, we continue to keep that under review, especially ahead of the further expansion of childcare in September. The figures will be published in the usual way, and we will make sure that we have the workforce there to deliver on the commitments that have been made. I say to the hon. Lady that in addition to almost doubling the early years pupil premium, we put in place a PS75 million expansion grant to make sure that ahead of the further roll-out in September, all our early years settings can deliver the places that are needed."
"In judging particular applications, particularly when local authorities seek to release land as grey-belt land, they do have to have sustainability as a concern. When cases go to the Planning Inspectorate--for example, on appeal--all these matters will be considered, but the right hon. Gentleman can find the definition of what needs to be considered in the NPPF. I am more than happy to point him to that. I turn very briefly to nature, because the right hon. Gentleman did mention the environment. Our reforms will help to deliver the homes and development that our country needs, but we have been very clear that these must not come at the expense of the natural environment or rural communities. We are clear that policies and decisions should recognise the intrinsic character of the countryside, and we are maintaining the strong protections for the best and most versatile agricultural land. We have preserved protections for high-quality green-belt land, and for land safeguarded for environmental reasons, such as national landscapes. As I have said, we are ensuring that major new developments in the green belt deliver more accessible green space and support nature recovery. I thank the right hon. Gentleman once again for sharing his concerns on this matter with the House. While I appreciate that there is a principled and strongly felt difference of opinion between him and me on these   matters, I trust that I have clearly laid out the Government's position. As ever, I would be more than happy to speak to him outside the Chamber, and to discuss any issues of local concern. Question put and agreed to. House adjourned."
"The development and growth of our infrastructure must include superfast broadband, so that we can all benefit from it. Too many areas are missing out, particularly remote, rural areas. We need a strong economy that includes superfast broadband, AI and energy provision to ensure that we are supercharged for the future. The announcement made by the Government yesterday that British railways will use British steel is a welcome example. That commitment must be replicated in every infrastructure project across the country, in our nuclear ambitions, roadbuilding, munitions, prisons and hospital-building projects. What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that the industrial strategy gives priority to British companies while addressing our ambitious infrastructure commitments?"
"I rise to speak about new clause 127 and amendment 153, both of which are in my name. Compulsory purchase is a highly emotive and highly controversial subject. Indeed, much of yesterday's debate was taken up by discussion of precisely the new CPO powers that the Bill will grant to Natural England and local authorities. The fact that under the Bill a farmer in Keighley can be told how to use his land, on pain of a CPO, as a result of a development in Kent is complete and utter madness, but that is exactly the intention of the Bill. No matter where someone owns land, they may be put at detriment by a scheme that is taking place elsewhere. That is exactly what the Government intend to do through the additional CPO powers: to give Natural England--an organisation with which I have huge frustration and which, dare I say it, is not accountable robustly to a Minister--more power to use compulsory purchase orders."
"Paragraph 7.36 of ""Erskine May"" states the process for setting out the ratification of international treaties. The Government's treaty tracker says the global oceans treaty that the Leader of the House referred to earlier has not been ratified, and yet the BBNJ treaty--the global oceans treaty--was laid before this House on 16 October 2023. It appears the Government are misleading themselves in believing that they have to introduce legislation implementing the treaty before they can ratify it. Would she meet me to discuss the conundrum that appears to be stopping us going to the UN oceans conference next week and laying the instrument of ratification so that the treaty can come into force?"
"My sympathies are with my hon. Friend's constituent. It is vital that victims are notified. Those victims who are currently eligible for the victim notification scheme should be given a victim liaison  officer to find out about their cases, but we know that there is more to do. We are bringing forward a new victim notification scheme in our Victims and Courts Bill, which will for the first time provide a dedicated helpline to get such information to victims and survivors."
I call the Liberal Democrat spokesman.
"I thank my hon. Friend for the excellent role she plays as a clinician. Her expertise is really welcome; we want to hear from a wide variety of experts in this House--that is very valuable. She understands from her professional background, as well as from her constituency, how important it is to look at the entire pathway of care for patients, and to ensure that they have the best possible care as close to home as possible. We think that is better not just for patients, but for clinical outcomes, and it is more efficient and better use of taxpayers' money. The move from hospitals to communities is front and centre of our 10-year plan, as is delivering neighbourhood health services."
"Mr. Speaker, just for clarification, I believe it to be the case when sharing a spot that, although customary, it is not actually necessary for us to indicate who we are sharing it with. The only thing that is necessary is to indicate that we are sharing it. The individual we are sharing it with can change up until the moment they rise."
"Mr. Speaker, the promised Liberal magic is not working on Donald Trump, and Quebec is suffering the consequences. Tariffs of 50% are being imposed on our aluminum and our steel. Some 2,000 layoffs were announced in our forestry industry, and that is not all. Yesterday, we learned that our aerospace industry is in the line of fire, and that Washington is thinking of imposing tariffs by the end of the month. Yet, in Ottawa, there is still no support for our key sectors, still no budget. The Liberals are still improvising. It has been three months. Sharing our concerns is not enough. What is the government waiting for? When will it protect industries in Quebec?"
"Mr. Speaker, can either minister answer whether they were aware of the remission order that was signed prior to the election that would provide relief to Canadian companies that are facing tariffs?"
"Mr. Chair, the member should raise her questions in the House directly to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs ."
"I thank the Chief Secretary to the Treasury for his statement, and for providing early sight of it. Our ability to invest in public infrastructure is a positive for individuals, communities and the country as a whole, and it is right that the new Government set out their strategy. The last Government had to deal with a series of economic disruptions, including the impact of covid, the unwinding of quantitative easing across all advanced economies, and the consequences of  Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The global impact was disrupted supply chains, increased inflation and raised interest rates. Notwithstanding those shocks, under the last Government, public sector expenditure on capital increased in real terms, from PS81.7 billion in 2019-20 to PS117.8 billion in 2024-25--an increase of 44%. Today, the Chief Secretary has confirmed expenditure of PS725 billion, but has provided very little detail. There is no project pipeline today; will he commit to coming back to this House when it is published? In 2024, the last infrastructure pipeline analysis included an investment pipeline of 660 projects over a 10-year period, commencing from 2024-25. The Chief Secretary's last statement to the House was, in very large part, a restatement of the investments in local transportation projects that had already been announced by the previous Conservative Government. Will he confirm how many of the 660 projects in the previous pipeline will be retained? Will he advise the House which major projects are being abandoned, and give some insight into his reasoning for doing so? Translating a pipeline into reality requires a labour force of sufficient size and with a range of skills--in construction, project management and engineering, for example. Again, the 2024 analysis by the Construction Industry Training Board indicated that that project pipeline would create labour pressures in many of those skills areas. Since coming to office, this Labour Government have increased national insurance and are proposing new regulations on employment, both of which will disproportionately affect the construction sector. Does the Chief Secretary have any concerns about the impact of those changes on the availability of labour? Will he advise the House what assessment he has made of skills pinch points and what steps the Government are taking to alleviate them? Fulfilling these plans will require investment by taxpayers and private capital. Will the Chief Secretary advise the House on whether there has been any significant change in the mix of private and public investments--within discrete sectors or overall--compared with the last pipeline analysis in 2024? The Government created the National Wealth Fund, and said that it was their principal investor--a critical part of the Government's growth strategy for infrastructure. The Chief Secretary has given the National Wealth Fund PS7 billion, but has made no mention of it today. Why has there been no mention of the National Wealth Fund? We are moving through an era with a rapidly accelerating pace of change, in which the period from technological innovation to obsolescence can be vanishingly short. The risk that public investment in new technology solutions will become redundant is increasing. While being forward-looking, the Government should also be careful to nurture both existing technologies and new but proven ones, so what are the Government's priorities for technology choices in the energy sector, and what actions will he take to protect taxpayers from technology redundancy risk? The Pension Schemes Bill, introduced by this Government, includes a reserved power for the Government to mandate the investments of pension schemes. Has the Chief Secretary had any discussions about--or had the Treasury do any analysis of--the use of mandation powers to provide financing to the capital investments he has announced today? Have the projects announced  today been assessed according to the revised Green Book rules? If not, will they be reassessed at some point on the revised basis, and what assurance can the Chief Secretary provide that these projects will give value for money to taxpayers? As this Government have stated, and as we acknowledge, when pressures on public expenditure increase, it is frequently capital expenditure that suffers. What actions is the Chief Secretary willing to take if finances are tight to protect the budgets for the projects he has announced today? Investment in infrastructure benefits from a stable economic background, a clear set of priorities, efficient delivery, and optimal returns for taxpayers and investors. Madam Deputy Speaker, I miss the Chief Secretary in his old guise as Chairman of the Business Select Committee, when there was less of the rhetoric and the partisanship. These big decisions need open communication and critical analysis if we are to improve value for money and get projects delivered on time and on budget. In those endeavours, the Chief Secretary will always have our support."
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by assuring the member for Waterloo that I consider her a friend. She is my parents' representative in the House now, as they have moved up to Waterloo, and she does a good job at it. I listened to the throne speech. I read the throne speech. I found it platitudinous. The goals that are in there are great, but I saw no details on how to get there. Most of all, there is no budget."
"Our British fleet of submarines are the most awesome and lethal machines in the world, keeping the peace unseen and unheard below the waves for generations. As my right hon. Friend the Defence Secretary said, the power in that punch comes from Derby's Rolls-Royce workers, who give them their nuclear reactor cores. Will the Defence Secretary tell Members how we can be involved in the recommended ""national endeavour"" public communications campaign to make it absolutely clear how fundamental our at-sea deterrent is to our national security?"
"Mr. Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment. I want to mention that I will be sharing my time with the member for Hull—Aylmer . I also want to congratulate all members of the House on winning their seats. I am here today to support the Speech from the Throne. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the voters of Beauport—Limoilou for doing me the honour of choosing me as their member of Parliament. I will do everything in my power to live up to their trust. Next, I want to thank all the volunteers who believed in me and in my election campaign. We certainly did not have a head start, but we took the time to talk to the people. I want to thank Jacques and Louis-Philippe. I want to thank my family and especially my parents, Huguette and Paul-Émile, who instilled their values in me and made me the man that I am. I also wish to thank Mélanie, my partner in life, for her support. It is thanks to her that I am able to undertake this extraordinary commitment and embark on this amazing adventure. I also want to acknowledge the people for whom I am here today: my four children, Christopher, Léa, Tristan-Olivier and Emma-Rose, and my two grandchildren, Jayden and Mason. The reason I ran for Parliament was to work to build a more prosperous Canada for them. I love them all very much. I am the youngest of seven children raised on a dairy farm in a small village called Notre‑Dame‑du‑Lac in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region. I spent my childhood working on the farm, helping my father and siblings with the milking. Later, as a teenager, I followed my brothers into the bush, to work as a lumberjack until I was 25 years old. At the age of 20, I became a father for the first time. I was plunged into a life full of challenges that I was not yet ready to face. At the banks, where I worked for two decades, I was lucky enough to be in a position to help people. I could help families, like my parents' family, become homeowners. Later, I had the opportunity to help entrepreneurs fulfill their dreams and create prosperity in our community. I fully understand the impact that uncertain times like these can have on the people in our communities. I helped families who could no longer afford their mortgages. I helped business owners who felt they were at the end of their rope and were just days away from filing for bankruptcy. I took the helm of Quebec City's chamber of commerce and industry during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many business owners in the region did not know what lay ahead for their businesses. I know the value of things. That is why I was so deeply moved by the throne speech. For me, the most important words in that speech were these: “the economy is only truly strong when it serves everyone”. In short, if we want to create economic value in a lasting way, we must do so in a way that respects our deeply held values. We also need to make sure no one is left behind. In short, this throne speech, which I have read, is a government road map that aligns perfectly with my personal values and with my ambitions for the Quebec City region. We need to invest, not just spend. The throne speech we heard last week gives me confidence that the Quebec City region will not only make it through this period of uncertainty, but will emerge stronger than ever. The government will quickly address an issue that is a huge problem in Beauport—Limoilou: the housing crisis. The plan is simple yet highly ambitious. The government is going to launch a massive homebuilding project in order to lower prices. The vast majority of first-time homebuyers will also save up to $50,000 in GST on homes at or under $1 million. That will help young people get onto the property ladder. Earlier, I quoted this phrase from the throne speech: “the economy is only truly strong when it serves everyone”. That is why I am proud of the concrete measures our government has announced to directly improve people's lives. I am thinking in particular of the tax cut, which will put money directly into the pockets of the middle class. It will allow a couple to save over $800 and will benefit more than 22 million Canadian citizens. That is not to mention the popular existing programs that will be maintained and enhanced, such as child care, pharmacare and, of course, dental care. With respect to economic development, the Quebec City region has been at the heart of the government's strategy for years. Thanks in particular to the work of my colleagues from Québec Centre and Louis‑Hébert , the Davie shipyard's future is secure. The Quebec bridge, a critical link and vital artery for Quebec City, is now owned by a government that sees its restoration as a priority. The government is also a key financial partner in Quebec City's strategic public transit project. The work will continue. The throne speech signals a new era of growth for Canadians. In my discussions with the people of Beauport—Limoilou, one thing that often came up was the idea that economic development projects should not be pitted against each other. It is not either-or. We can build by saying “and” instead. The same is true for the environment. The greatest challenge of our generation is to build a sustainable economy, an economy that respects our planet. Some would have us believe that we must choose between economic development and environmental protection. We can do both. There is no point in dividing people. We should work together to build for the long term. I strongly believe that the Quebec City region has a major role to play in Canada's future. For millennia, my region has been a dynamic and essential trade hub. Quebec has always been and will always be the gateway to America. Having come to realize that our U.S.-centric supply chains are less secure than we thought, we are going to diversify our economy. Canada will increasingly look to Europe for its supply chains. My region was a builder yesterday and continues to be a builder today. It has always been a driver of prosperity for this country in the past, and that will not change. In Mandarin, the word “crisis” consists of two ideograms. The first one means “danger”. We have certainly felt that over the past few months with our neighbour to the south. The second is “opportunity”. We are entering a period of opportunity. We have the opportunity to remove barriers to internal trade and labour mobility, which cost Canada as much as $200 billion each year, and the opportunity to create a major energy corridor and become an energy superpower. Let us seize every opportunity to make our country a G7 economic leader. The people in my riding of Beauport—Limoilou are proud of this and intend to work on helping our country flourish and building a strong and united Canada. In closing, I am proud of my professional career, proud of the values that make me who I am today, proud of our government's ambitious vision for its citizens and proud to be here with all of my colleagues to build the strong and united Canada of tomorrow. The true north is indeed strong and free."
"I rise today to recognize the remarkable dedication and 25 years of pastoral service of Pastor Alton Bridges of Park Manor M.B. Church, located at 8328 S. Green St., Chicago, Illinois. Born in Chicago on July 23, 1964, Pastor Bridges is a true native of our great city. He received his foundational education at Chicago Vocational School before earning a Bachelor of Arts in Electrical Engineering from DeVry Institute of Technology. Pastor Bridges has been an integral part of the church community his entire life, ultimately answering a call to ministry. Before his pastoral journey, he held a supervisory position at a company then known as Eleck Tech. For a quarter of a century, Pastor Bridges has faithfully served his congregation and the wider community. His commitment extends far beyond the walls of his church. Annually, he provides crucial food services to the greater Auburn-Gresham, South Shore, and Ashburn Wright communities. He actively partners with local grammar schools, assisting families in need by garnering donations to provide them with clothing, funding, and food. In 2020, Pastor Bridges initiated a ``Garden of Church,'' offering fresh vegetation to anyone in need--a testament to his innovative approach to community support. He actively collaborates with neighborhood stakeholders and is a vital part of the ``1st Ladies of Initiatives.'' His generosity also reaches beyond Chicago, as he consistently donates to national relief efforts, exemplified by his fundraising for families impacted by the California fires. Furthermore, he makes annual donations to support college-bound students, investing in the next generation. Pastor Bridges is a devoted family man, supported by his wife, Phyllis Bridges, and their children, Symone, Markeeta, and Phillip. Pastor Alton Bridges's unwavering commitment to his faith, his congregation, and the well-being of the Chicago community is truly commendable. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring his 25 years of profound pastoral service and his enduring impact on the lives of countless individuals."
"today I rise to honor and remember Otto Frederick Warmbier as June 19 marks 8 years since his tragic death at the hands of the North Korea regime. Otto was a dedicated young man who graduated as salutatorian of his high school in Ohio before attending the University of Virginia. While on a school tour in North Korea in 2015, Otto was imprisoned and tortured by the North Korea regime. He died just a few days after his release at just 22 years young. Otto experienced what no human being should ever have to go through. May his story continue to remind us of all the atrocities the North Korea regime is capable of. Mr. Speaker, we remember, and we will continue to honor Otto and his memories. In Korean: ``Ulineun Otto-leul yeong-wonhi gieok-hal geos- ibnida.''"
"Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Québécois agrees to apply the vote and will be voting in favour."
"I thank the hon. Member for raising that issue. As he knows, the agreement was laid before both Houses on 22 May, and under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act both Houses have 21 sitting days--running to 3 July--to scrutinise and lay, as he said, anything they want to on that. We will ensure that the full CRaG process is followed at all times. He will be aware that, in addition, we will introduce legislation to implement the agreement, and there will be ample time for the House to consider the Bill to ratify the treaty."
"Order. There has been a lot of back-and-forth. I will ask members to try to keep the back-and-forth to a minimum if they do not have the floor. Resuming debate, the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources."
"Mr. Speaker, the hon. member well knows that the way we get things done in this country is by working together with indigenous peoples, with provinces, with cities, with unions and with private sector investment. That is the way we are going to move forward. We are going to move forward with consensus, getting investment decisions made while having good, strong, well-paying jobs involved in the construction and operation of these major projects. Consensus is at the heart of this very bill."
"I have been having regular conversations, as have the Foreign Secretary and colleagues across the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office. I was in Poland just last week discussing with our Polish allies our important collaboration. The week before that, I was in Rome with the Weimar+ group. These are all active and ongoing conversations and, as the hon. Member said, they are absolutely crucial at a time of such geopolitical uncertainty."
I take this opportunity to mark an important week for our armed forces. I welcome everything my hon. Friend says about support for our armed forces and their families by way of investment in their homes and more money in their pockets. Does he agree that supporting our armed forces goes way beyond just the equipment that they need on the frontline? It is about making sure that their families are valued through the support that the Government can give them and that they receive from the communities they live in.
I call the shadow Minister.
"Around our asylum hotel on Blackpool seafront, we see increased illegal working in our takeaways, bars and restaurants. Will the Minister outline to my constituents how this Government are tackling that illegal working, to ensure that we have safe spaces for people in the jobs in our vital tourism industry?"
"Housing is not the only issue affecting armed forces families. When a member of the forces moves, their family often move with them. My work experience student Amy, who is in the Gallery today, is from an armed forces family and attended three primary schools. One school provided dedicated support, whereas others had less understanding of the issues that children whose parents are in the forces may face. Will the Secretary of State work with the Secretary of State for Education to ensure that armed forces children receive consistent support at every school that they attend?"
"Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that on April 28, we elected, for the very first time to the House of Commons, the member of Parliament who is now Canada's Prime Minister , and our Prime Minister is, in fact, committed to ensuring that we build a stronger and healthier economy. Ultimately his goal is to achieve having the strongest economy in the G7. That is where the Prime Minister and the new administration's efforts are going to be. I am very proud of that fact."
"I have the greatest sympathy for my hon. Friend's constituents. I encourage Stevenage borough council to work with our National Fly-tipping Prevention Group, which shares best practice on tackling fly-tipping. We are also taking direct action on some of the littered items, because once there is litter, people think that they can fly-tip, and then they think that they can dump. That is why we have banned the sale of single-use vapes from 1 June, and I stand ready to work with his council."
"Mr. Speaker, as this is only my second time rising in this House, I will take a moment to once again thank my constituents out in Mississauga Centre for putting their trust in me. This past election, I heard from constituents day in, day out about a lot of issues and about their biggest priorities, things like affordability, health care and public safety. I also heard a lot about the confidence they have in this government to deliver. We are on the same page. This is problematic, which is exactly why we are acting, only we are doing it within the perimeters of the law. The way our government has responded—"
"Mr. Speaker, one of the things that the Conservatives are a little sore on is the issue that there is more turnover in the Liberal benches than there is in the Conservative benches. We are talking about a new Prime Minister and a new administration. The Prime Minister has been a member of Parliament for two months; Pierre Poilievre was a career politician. In terms of change, and this is the reason it is important to recognize it, we have a new Prime Minister with a new administration that is going to tackle the problems that my friend just raised in the form of his question—"
(Title agreed to) Shall the bill carry?
"Mr. Speaker, in all national security decisions, my utmost concern is that of the safety of Canadians. I will support law enforcement and national security agencies, who do their work impartially and effectively. In an abundance of caution, and to ensure that there is no perception of any conflict, I have asked the public safety officials to implement a screen on national security issues relating to the Tamil community."
"Madam Speaker, the member spoke about how, in the process of the elimination of the consumer carbon tax, there was a dissonance in the timing. I think we can clearly see that this was very political. The government wanted to be able to have things look as good as possible during the election and then not worry too much about the consequences afterwards. When it comes to regional accounting, there are a lot of different things that are coming and going, and it should be viewed in a macro way. What is most important is that the Liberals have left in place the industrial carbon tax and other policies that clearly, according to today's numbers, are killing jobs and opportunities."
"When my hon. Friend talks about the increased risk smaller local authorities would face through franchising, he could be talking about my local authority, Isle of Wight council. Does he see anything in the Bill that is appealing to small unitary authorities, or is this really just a Bill for bigger metropolitan areas and large towns?"
"I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I was just curious why, if buses are so popular and important, as he rightly says, so few of his Back-Bench colleagues are lining up to speak in this important debate?"
"Mr. Speaker, the new government is working to build new economic and security relationships. One of the most important sectors of economic and export potential is defence. Earlier this week, the Prime Minister announced a $9.3-billion investment. This is a generational investment that will create thousands of jobs. As part of the new government's plan to expand into new export markets, can the Minister of International Trade tell the House how he plans to help diversify defence and trade?"
Order. It will help others if Members can keep to four minutes.
"Mr. Chair, again, as of today, the average time to process these claims is 14 to 18 months."
"Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my colleague on his speech and on his election. I welcome him to Ottawa. He used to be a member of the Quebec National Assembly, which brings back many memories for us. I definitely remember. I must begin by congratulating him on the thoroughness and accuracy of the facts he shared. He did not say that carbon pricing is a bad thing. He simply said that the government lost the communications battle to the Conservative Party, which has been talking about axing the tax for several years. I wanted to point that out because I think it is worth mentioning. I would like to understand something, however. When my colleague was a member of the Quebec National Assembly, he said that Quebec was proud to be part of a carbon market of its own making. In April 2015, he even said that when Ontario joined the carbon market, he was proud that two-thirds of the Canadian economy was now participating in the cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions. He said that at the Canadian green economy round table in Quebec City. When he is in Quebec City, the carbon market is a good idea. However, when he is in Ottawa, it is a bad idea. I would like my colleague to explain this to me, because I want to understand."
"Mr Speaker, The Times has told the world how old you are today."
"Mr. Chair, the member is a very experienced member, but the number is $1.27 trillion."
"As my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon and Buchan (Harriet Cross) made clear earlier, the ONS statistics are very clear: 109,000 fewer on payroll in May alone and 276,000 fewer since the autumn Budget. As UKHospitality points out, the NICs changes were ""felt most intensely by foundational sectors like hospitality,"" which ""necessitates an urgent review"". My question to the Minister is simple: where will his red line sit? How many more jobs have to come off payroll before the Department for Business and Trade will stand up to the Treasury on this? Another 100,000? A million? Where is the line?"
"Madam Speaker, you have handed me a golden opportunity to say hello. You know how much I appreciate you, and I am delighted to see you again. Congratulations on your election to this position. Please know that you are in my thoughts. I also congratulate all my colleagues who have been elected. It is true in life, it is true in love, it is true in general, but it is especially true in politics: One should never take anything for granted. Over the past few months, we have learned that we cannot take democracy for granted. I am a sovereignist, a separatist here in the House. Our voices must be heard. It is a voice from Quebec. We are lucky to live in a democracy. We are lucky to be able to share these ideas and debate them. It is a great privilege. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all 82,525 voters in the riding of Mirabel for their trust. I include those who voted for another party, those who did not vote and their children, those who will be voting in a few years, those to whom we must leave a clean and healthy planet and a healthy environment. We do not count them in our voters, but they exist. I would like to thank out supporters, because before being members of Parliament, before being elected, we are first and foremost political advocates, carriers of a cause and ideas that we hold dear. We devote a great deal of our lives to them. However, there are costs. A few minutes ago, my wife texted me to tell me that my six-month-old boy had just sat up for the first time. I was happy, but it shows how much we sacrifice to be here, for our ideas. This work must be respected. I would like to thank the campaigners, everyone who supported me and, of course, the citizens of all the municipalities in my riding and their elected officials. We have worked on many files, but some are not finished. I will continue to carry them. I carry them with me, in my heart, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I will be worthy of them. Being the member for Mirabel is one of my greatest honours in life. It is hard to find the words to express how fortunate we are to be doing this work. There was talk of elections. Everyone knows that there was an election recently. The circumstances were unusual, with the arrival of Donald Trump, tariffs and a new Prime Minister with new polls. Under those circumstances, we were told that we needed an election quickly. What did the Liberals do? They found a new leader and formed a new cabinet, including some ministers who were around for the length of a reality TV show. One of the ministers who had been around longer was the Minister of Finance . He was told to draft a budget because that is all he has to do. He was told to work on the budget because we were going to have a new government and a new Parliament, and we could not table estimates without a budget. Why? It is a matter of transparency. In our work as elected officials, especially in opposition, our main tool is information. The government has the information, such as the budget forecasts, the deficits, the debts, the revenue; when we are not given that information, we cannot do our job. They are not even doing the bare minimum of what needs to be done in the first week of a sitting, yet the Liberals tell us there is a precedent. Earlier, I heard the member for Winnipeg North talk about Stephen Harper as though he were a disease in need of a cure. That is the precedent he gave for not tabling a budget. At the time, Mr. Harper's government had just arrived after years and years of Liberal governments. The senior public service had been appointed by the Liberals. There was no cabinet. These people had not sat in the House. There was no global crisis. What is more, the election was not called because a budget needed to be tabled. That is not what happened. That is the precedent we are being given for not tabling a budget. This is a 10-year-old, worn-out government, repackaged under a new name and with a new CEO. That is what we have. The Liberals had time to table a budget, or even just a budget statement. It could be something shorter. The previous finance minister got us used to shorter updates. I worked with the Minister of Finance and National Revenue when he was industry minister. We worked on his Bill C‑27 on artificial intelligence. He is a brilliant man and a pleasure to work with. We call him the Energizer bunny because he is super energetic, but his drawback is that he has a tendency to not finish what he starts. I think that in some drawer in his office there is a half-finished budget. He has certainly started working on it. Why will he not table it? It could be a budget statement. Instead of doing that, the government is turning into an oil projects department. Maybe in the end, it will be all about vacuum cleaners. I guess we have to wait and see, because it changes all the time. The risk is that we are being told that, in two years, we will be able to approve all sorts of projects that will quickly save the economy. We are told that the projects are going to go ahead and that is the only way we are going to get by. We have seen this strategy before. It was called the Canada Infrastructure Bank. That bank had the same mandate for the same projects, and the provinces were all in on it. Everyone was happy. Supposedly, many projects were going to be implemented, including public transit projects. However, things went so wrong that when the minister appeared before the committee, we asked him why he was not changing the name of the bank, since it was no longer even a bank and was not building any infrastructure. That is how badly it was working. The Liberals say they are going to approve everything in two years. They are introducing a huge bill that could infringe on the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces in many ways. We will have to study it. In short, that is the Liberal plan. No budget is being presented, and no budget forecasts are being made. Bankers are not what they used to be. What immediate action do we need to take to protect our economy? We must fully protect supply management through legislation. That is what we need to do. There has been progress, but the Liberal discourse has me worried. We know that, in the beginning, the Prime Minister was new to this, that he was taking one step forward and one step back. He was being advised and sometimes he listened to the adviser and sometimes he did not. We are not sure what happened, but in the beginning, he said he would protect supply management. I believe that is his intention. I want to believe it. He told us that we do not need a bill. Then he realized that Parliament exists, even though it is not always obvious that he knows that. He realized that a bill had already been drafted, that a bill was already ready to go and that it was two senators short of being passed. During the leaders' debate, he said that the Liberals would vote for the bill. Now, the Liberals are back in the House saying that they will protect supply management, but not through legislation. They came up with new reasons. Yesterday in the House, the Liberals gave us new reasons not to fully protect supply management through legislation. The first reason they gave us is that there is no point in doing this through a bill, because bills can be undone. Someone can introduce another bill and undo the first one. Imagine if I took my car to a mechanic, and the mechanic refused to repair it on the grounds that it would break again eventually. That is pretty much the same thing. While we are at it, we might as well stop regulating firearms and stop amending the Criminal Code. What are we here for as legislators if not to pass legislation? This is what they tell us every time. The Bloc Québécois has introduced this bill 13 times. If the government had said yes the first time, we would have the bill by now. The second reason they gave us for not protecting supply management is that it would take time to get through the House and that, by the time the bill received royal assent two years from now, the negotiations would be over. Still, the government claims that in just two years, it can build an energy corridor in a country the size of a continent, make major infrastructure investments, build a port way up at Hudson Bay and launch a major federal project office, while consulting all indigenous peoples. It says that, yet it seems that two years is not enough time for this same government to move fast enough to pass a bill that has already been drafted, introduced, put on notice and passed. Apparently, the government lacks faith in its senators. The Americans will respect this legislative approach because U.S. negotiators are appointed by Congress. The bulk of negotiations are handled not by politicians, but by professional negotiators within the departments. That is a good thing, considering that the last time Liberal politicians went down to Mar-a-Lago to negotiate with President Donald Trump, they were treated to a T-bone steak with ketchup followed by threats of annexation. The task needs to be entrusted to non-elected professionals who are required to perform their work transparently and appointed by Parliament. The Americans will respect that. The matter is urgent. No matter what their reason is for not supporting a bill to protect supply management, it is basically an admission of failure. After all, the Canadian government is not going to be the one deciding what is on the table. When two people negotiate, if someone puts something on the table, it stays on the table. Now they are telling us that if supply management is on the table, they will hold out. However, the last three times they told us they were going to hold out, they did not, and nearly 20% of our market was sold to the Americans for compensation. Having a business' list of customers sold off in exchange for a cheque, which is what they did to our dairy farmers, is not a career plan; it is a retirement plan. We need to protect our supply management system. They talk about creating one economy out of 13. As we know, that is the Liberal line they keep repeating. The Prime Minister 's cabinet prints that in bold and underlined and they repeat it. What problem do we have with that? What problem does the National Assembly of Quebec have with that? That rhetoric suggests to Quebeckers and people from the other provinces that if the provinces and Quebec do not give up their jurisdictions and do not allow Ottawa to walk all over them, then they are rejecting the others and engaging in protectionism. The Liberal government makes it sound like there is a guard at the Quebec border with a fleur-de-lis on his face and a blue cape at his back monitoring the containers, examining them gun in hand and sending them back to Manitoba. I have the data in front of me. Quebec's biggest trading partner is Ontario. Our imports and exports are higher with the rest of Canada than they are with the rest of the world, including the United States. There is free trade, but let us not forget that even the Supreme Court, in Comeau, said that if we had perfect free trade within Canada, that would prevent the provinces from regulating in a way that protects the public. Saying that it takes just one economy is just cheap rhetoric to tell people to give up their jurisdictions, allow pipelines through, or they will be seen as Trumpists and just as bad as the orange man to the south. That is what we are being accused of. If they want us to work together, then this sort of rhetoric needs to stop. They cannot tell us that they want everyone in Canada to sit at the same table and work together and celebrate the good times all while they keep up the rhetoric of creating one economy out of 13. What do we need to do to address the crisis? We have been saying it for a long time: We need to be competitive. We need to be more productive. We need to invest in training. We need to invest in education, modernization, automation, home automation and artificial intelligence. We need to invest in our universities, our CEGEPs, our vocational training programs. We need to do all kinds of things to make Quebeckers and Canadians produce more per hour worked. That is what we need to do. It is also the solution to the labour shortage. That is the job of Quebec and the provinces, but there is a specific agreement with Quebec on workforce training. The same goes for taxation. If we want to attract investment, we need a competitive tax system, we need to be able to offer export assistance programs, and Quebec has a role to play in that. Quebec knows what it is doing. It is a geographic reality. Canada is a big country, and Ottawa is far away. It is a geographic reality. How can we ensure that the provinces and Quebec can do their job so that we can move on to the economy of tomorrow? They need to have the means. The reality is that in Quebec's public finances today, health care eats up approximately half of the Government of Quebec's program spending. Technology is costing more and more, the population is aging, infrastructure is failing and, as health care takes up more and more room in the Government of Quebec's program spending, there is less and less money for the children I mentioned at the beginning of my speech. They are the ones who cannot vote yet, the ones who are going to work, study and grow in the most competitive economy in the history of humanity. There is no more money for universities, for CEGEPs, for vocational training, for assistance to businesses, for support, for adjusting our tax system. It is a tragedy. When we say that we need higher health transfers and that the deal with the federal government is that 35% of health costs should be paid for through unconditional transfers, that is what the funds are for. The government tells us that health transfers have increased. Granted, an agreement was entered into with the federal government, but the amount is not enough. When the Prime Minister met behind closed doors with the provincial premiers in Saskatoon, was he aware that each and every one of them has called on the federal government to increase those health transfers to 35%? That could be done over several years if the government budgeted for it. It can be done, preparations can be made, but evidently the government does not budget. That is what it is for. It is for the economy of tomorrow. What is the government doing instead? It is talking to us about pipelines, oil and gas, when our energy security is already taken care of. As for the plan for one economy instead of 13, the economic benefits were calculated by the Montreal Economic Institute, or MEI, though they were not verified. Between 1999 and 2019, the MEI defended the oil and gas industry 97.5% of the time during its media appearances. This information comes from a doctoral thesis. I am one of those people who reads them. The MEI said that climate science was mafia science. While we do not know who funds this institute, some people assume that it is backed by oil companies. Here is why: At the time of the energy east pipeline, the CEO, who is one of the highest-paid non-profit CEOs in Canada, complained that TransCanada was not giving him money. Perhaps he held off complaining about the others because they were giving him money. The other study that was held up as proof that this plan will have infinite benefits was done by the International Monetary Fund. It is an econometric, statistical study. It was very intelligent, a well-crafted academic document that was summarized by the National Bank of Canada and published widely during the election campaign. It made the rounds. Those folks engaged in a thought experiment and asked themselves what Canada's GDP would be if there were no more provinces and no more geographic borders. According to HEC Montréal's Centre for Productivity and Prosperity, the main reason people in Newfoundland do not do business with people in British Columbia is not because we have 13 economies instead of one. It is because those two places are as far apart as Quebec is from Venezuela, which is something to consider if they want to build a pipeline. That is the situation. There is one last thing I would like to address. We have to promote Quebec's businesses and business sectors. Why does the auto sector get $4 billion the moment they say “ouch”? Why has oil become a “nation-building project” when we do not have a national aerospace strategy? Why are we one of the only countries in the world capable of manufacturing an aircraft or a helicopter from A to Z, in a long-cycle, high-value-added industry, where more than half of the research and development jobs are in Quebec, and yet we have no government strategy? Why is Bombardier is able to produce reconnaissance planes that are purchased by a number of countries, but Canada chooses to pay more to buy from Boeing? That is what it did a few months ago, without going through a call for tenders, to buy aircraft that were about to become obsolete. The other countries that are buying this military equipment from Bombardier are asking us why our own country is not buying it. Why is there no strategy? We asked the then minister of industry, but he did not know. The Liberals will not tell us. There is no strategy for this long-cycle industry. Do they realize how privileged we are to have such an industry here? This industry is present in my riding, Mirabel, and in Longueuil—Saint-Hubert , whose member is playing on his phone. Do the Liberals realize what a privilege it is to have such an industry in a country the size of Canada, which, given its GDP, should not even be part of the G7? I believe there is a lot of work to be done. There are intelligent people with good ideas on both sides of the House. That is a good thing because the government is a minority. I, personally, am all in favour of cross-party collaboration. However, we are going to have to share ideas. We will need to go beyond rhetoric, pipelines, “one economy out of 13” and other things that, frankly, make no economic sense. I think I am qualified to speak on that. I am now ready and more than willing to take questions."
"I thank my hon. Friend and relatively near neighbour for her question. We are in constant dialogue to achieve exactly that objective. She will have noticed last week's announcement on the extension of free school meals to everyone on universal credit, which is a key plank of our food strategy. It is exactly those kinds of initiatives that we think will benefit British producers."
"Madam Speaker, I have spent a lot of time listening to speeches from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons since the beginning of this Parliament, and it is just getting started. I should also point out that we heard from him a lot in the previous Parliament, as well. What fascinates me is how he always speaks with such conviction. He truly believes what he is saying. I find that interesting, because he has spent the past four years selling us the NDP platform, with his hand on his heart and the utmost conviction. Now he is selling us the Conservative Party platform, with his hand on his heart and the utmost conviction. Can he explain how he manages to swing from one extreme to the other so easily and with such conviction?"
"Madam Speaker, I understand this matter involves Correctional Services Canada and is subject to the release by the parole board. Of course, Bill C-2 has a number of important measures in place to protect the border, including ensuring that in regard to those who are predators, especially on the Internet, using child pornography, for example, law enforcement has the right tools to be able to do its job more adequately."
"Many happy returns, Mr Speaker. Chipping Community Energy in my constituency is a brilliant ground source heat loop feasibility project. We know that grid infrastructure is weaker in rural areas, and there is a risk that more remote areas get left behind in the move to decarbonisation, in the same way that they did with the broadband roll-out. Will the Minister share what role she sees local initiatives, like Chipping Community Energy, playing in our overall plans for energy security and affordability, and what steps she is taking to help such projects to provide more cheap energy to our rural communities?"
"Mr. Chair, I do not believe I alter reports. That is not my job."
"I am grateful for my hon. Friend's work in this area. He will recognise that Gibraltar, as an overseas territory, is at the strong end of tackling issues of illicit finance and is paving the way. There is more work to do on this issue and particularly on beneficial ownership. I intend to take this forward, working alongside our new envoy in this area, Baroness Hodge, and culminating, I hope, in an event in London next year."
"Mr. Chair, the minister failed to answer because the answer is zero. The Liberals failed to deliver any. Under the federal lands initiative, 4,000 units were to be built by 2028. It has been seven years and the government has only built 309. How does the government plan on building the remaining 3,691 units when it takes seven years to build 309 units?"
"Mr. Speaker, does Canada trade more internationally than within its own borders?"
"I rise to support a number of new clauses and amendments to the Bill. The common thread running through all of them is a need to address some of the gaps in the safeguards and oversight. Should the Bill pass, I at least want to ensure that we improve its protections and remove some of the risks that it contains. New clause 4 requires the chief medical officer to monitor the operation of the legislation, rather than depending solely on the assisted dying commissioner. Alongside the requirement for a High Court judge, oversight by the CMO was removed during the Committee stage. This means that, essentially, the assisted dying commissioner would mark their own homework. New clause 4 returns the safeguard of independent oversight, which is sensible given the significant concerns expressed by many experts and organisations, which were often neutral on the principle, but concerned about the Bill. They include the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Association for Palliative Medicine, the British Geriatrics Society, the Royal College of Physicians and many experts such as Professor James Monckton Smith, a leading criminologist, Baroness Finlay, Parliament's leading expert on palliative care, Sir David Haslam, former head of the British Medical Association and of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence--my previous employer--and many more. All have expressed concerns, even when neutral on the principle of the adequacy of the Bill. Hence new clause 4 requires an annual report to include ""information about the application of the Act in relation to-- persons who have protected characteristics, and any other description of persons specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State."" I fervently hope that that includes domestic violence victims. Amendment 13 very sensibly adds the requirement that the commissioner appointment is not the sole remit of the Prime Minister at the time, by requiring the consent of the Health and Social Care Committee. This provides a safeguard against ideological and politically motivated appointments, and I would be very critical of anyone who would want to prevent that. Amendment 15 addresses the significant concerns about the involvement of private--for profit--providers of assisted dying. There are concerns that, when there is a commercial relationship between providers, there will be a gaming of the system. That risks compromising the relationship between the co-ordinating doctor and the independent doctor. Likewise, the existence of such providers does not allay concerns about doctor shopping, as was raised in the previous debate. Hence amendment 15 will require private providers to be transparent and provide reports on service members, service numbers, costs and revenue. In previous debates and in the public discourse I have found it very disconcerting that, in response to legitimate concerns, all that we have been offered--as we have seen today--are some promised, unspecified future regulations that will fix the gap--[Hon. Members: ""Hear, hear!""]"
"Okay, shadow Secretary of State. Let us see if it is a point of order."
"Again, my hon. Friend is making an excellent point. May I remind him that there is a great deal of underused brownfield land that can sometimes be made available for parking? In my constituency, I worked previously as a councillor on a scheme to tarmac an unadopted road, which my hon. Friend the  Member for Norwich North (Alice Macdonald) mentioned, and unadopted roads and other areas of hardstanding that are not formally used for parking can be converted without any loss of green space."
I call the shadow Minister.
Will my hon. Friend give way?
"I cannot believe it was 30 years ago that my hon. Friend was learning about green energy. We have been sprinting to deliver clean power. When we came into government we set a mission to do it by 2030. There were naysayers, and there continues to be naysayers, but we were not deterred by that. So whether it is removing the ban on onshore wind, whether it is record investment in nuclear, or whether it is a record renewables auction, we are very clear that we are putting in the investment--we are putting in the hard yards, the hard graft--to deliver clean power. Why are we doing that? Not because of ideology, but because we recognise that we inherited an energy system that was not working on behalf of consumers. We recognise that people were under huge pressure--a status quo that we were not willing to accept. We will deliver clean power, so that we can bear down on bills and ensure that we drive down energy bills for good."
"In the spirit of the day, I suggest that the hon. Gentleman waits for the Defence Secretary's statement that is coming soon. I am very aware that when people go to a gig, they want the main act, not the warm up, so I look forward to him speaking in due course."
What steps she is taking to increase the number of school-based nursery places.
"I am normally reasonably impressed by the hon. Gentleman on defence matters, but let me say politely that we have PS5 billion extra in the defence budget this financial year thanks to the decisions by the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. By 2027, we will have over PS13 billion more in cash terms compared with the situation that his party left. When it comes to increasing defence spending, we are doing it three years earlier. It is worth reminding him that the last time this country spent 2.5% of GDP on defence was under the last Labour Government. It is something that his party never achieved for a single day when it was in power."
Do Ministers agree with the Trussell Trust's recent estimate that the weekly cost of basic essentials is PS120 for a single person and PS205 for a couple?
Will the hon. Lady give way?
"Mr. Chair, if the bail system is quite sound and working, why are police chiefs, premiers and victims' families saying the opposite?"
"Mr. Speaker, I am going to split my time. I rise today in support of the Conservative motion in opposition to the government's authoritarian, misguided and altogether nonsensical ban on gas-powered vehicles. A ban on gas-powered vehicles sounds like some kind of conspiracy theory or something straight out of a science fiction novel, but it is real stuff. It is happening right now, and the Minister of Environment told us as much last week. She did not tell us that it was some aspiration or some kind of 100-year plan. She told us that it was a hard ban, a concrete requirement the government is going to bring in less than 10 years from now. We know that members across the way like to think while wearing their radical thinking caps or their CN Tower-climbing jumpsuits, but let us take them off for one second and really consider what a policy like this does for Canadians and the Canadian economy. It would mean that we would need nearly 700,000 charging ports from coast to coast in less than a decade. We have 60,000 right now, and get this. In 2024, last year, the government managed to install fewer chargers than it did the year before. Apparently, the only thing moving slower than the construction of electric vehicle charging stations is the government email mandating them. This ban would also mean that $600 billion would have to be spent preparing infrastructure. That is over $11,000 for every single car on the road at the moment. It would mean even lower car sales, lost jobs, higher auto prices and misery for consumers and workers alike. That is not according to me. That is according to the CEOs of some of the largest automakers in Canada. Canadian economists and the non-partisan number crunchers say that this ban would cost us 38,000 jobs, if the sector remains operational at all. The boots on the ground, the people who make the cars, purchase the parts and navigate international trading relationships, say that a move like this would take us out of alignment with key trading partners like the U.S. in an integrated North American market, threatening our position in the supply chain and the global economy. Let us not forget that the Liberals want to do all of this at a time when our auto sector is already menaced by tariffs south of the border, when we are already losing jobs left, right and centre, The Globe and Mail reporting more today, and when Canadians are still reeling from the worst inflation in four decades. Add an industrial carbon tax to this and we now have a recipe for uncompetitiveness, all while preaching the bravado of “elbows up”. Canadians cannot even think about putting food on the table or finding a place to live. Frankly, I think the last thing on their minds is putting a new Tesla in the driveway. The government is going to come in with another job-killing mandate, another burden on consumers and the economy, all because it knows better than people do. I do not think the environment minister has taken any time to think about these mandates in a real way. I know that her accomplice, the heritage minister , who actually put these mandates in place, has not either. This is what we get when we govern by vibes instead of governing by logic and reason. Canadians have certainly gotten used to this from the Liberals, but even by established standards, this ban deserves some kind of award in creative governance. If we take a deeper dive into the program and the inconsistencies and lack of oversight, we end up with just plain lunacy. I think Canadians watching this at home have no idea that it is happening. This is a plot twist that nobody saw coming, except for every single automaker in the industry. The federal electric vehicle rebate program just ran out of money two months early, poof, gone, vanished, just like that, but the sales mandates are still in place. It is like telling Canadians that they have to eat nothing but steak for dinner every night while simultaneously taking away their grocery budget and calling it a climate plan. Automakers, dealers and consumers were shockingly not thrilled to find out that the $5,000 rebate evaporated overnight. Some poor souls even went to the dealership expecting that rebate and did not get it when they were in line to buy their electric cars. I am not a fan of the rebate to begin with, but nothing says stable investment climate like a last-minute pullback of a rebate that Canadians thought they were getting. Let us not forget the nearly $31 billion in subsidies that were handed out to foreign automakers and battery manufacturers, all of which are already going bust in a really big way. There are billions for multinational corporations and their executives, but heaven forbid a consumer gets $5,000 to buy one of these things. The new economic model the Liberals always think of is to subsidize the company that builds the product, then subsidize the consumer that buys it, and hope that nobody notices that the math does not add up. We cannot prop up both ends of the see-saw forever. Eventually, someone is going to want a product the government will not write a cheque for. Markets do not work on that basis, when Ottawa plays both the buyer and the seller in all of this. In Ottawa's mind, the electric vehicle revolution is happening because they said so. Incentives are not their problem. Infrastructure is also somebody else's problem. Communication seems optional for them, but the mandates are very real, and they are sticking to them. The result will be that automakers will face penalties for not selling enough electric vehicles, consumers will face higher prices and dealers will face unsellable inventory. They have told us as much. They have told the government as much. Ottawa will face absolutely no accountability for any of it. What is more is that the liberty and freedom of choice that is guaranteed to every single Canadian vanishes with each passing decision. They are being replaced by a government that thinks it knows best about what someone should eat, what they should drink, how they should drink it, or what you should use to drink it, and yes, what kind of car they should drive. For those watching this at home, the government does not want them to drive their gas-powered cars anymore. It has decided to mandate that everybody drives an electric car. It is insanity. The bureaucrats, the middle managers, the members of Parliament and the ministers of the government think they know better than Canadian consumers, and they want to make those decisions from Ottawa. They think they should be in control of every aspect of someone's life. We have seen this show before. We know how it ends. We can take our pick. It is a mandate, a carbon tax, some weird DEI quota or plastic straws. The Liberals believe they can control someone's life better than they can. They can make decisions better than Canadians can for themselves, and we get significantly worse outcomes. In fact, they backtrack on some of those outcomes. We get those outcomes at a greater cost. It sometimes takes seven times longer than it should, and it leaves everybody worse off. Instead of a government that does a few important things really well, we get a government that does a zillion things badly. We still cannot get anybody's passport to come in the mail on time because the passport printer is broken and the mail people are on strike. This is a government that wants to do everything for Canadians, to creep into their lives and to take control. The government wants to build an economy based on edicts, mandates and ideologies, and a healthy sprinkling of fairy dust, and none of this is actually going to happen. Edicts, mandates, ideology and all of those things do not put food on the table. All of those things do not actually help people. All of those things do not provide the choice that someone should have as a Canadian. This might come as news to the government, but that is what it does. Individual people living their lives as they see fit, participating in a free market, making decisions based on rational analysis and scarce resources is something the government knows nothing about. For instance, in my community, there are lots of people who drive electric vehicles because it makes sense. They drive short distances. We do not have erratic weather. We do not have really cold temperatures. With the right incentives, it makes sense based on what people choose. However, try telling somebody who lives in rural Alberta, who has to drive an hour or more just to run errands, and where it gets to -40°C, that they are going to be mandated to drive an electric vehicle by the government. It makes no sense and is not rational, which is exactly why we oppose this mandate. All those on the opposite side of the aisle might be content to pursue the ideological war on the gas-powered car, but Conservatives on this side of the House will not stand for it. We will speak for every single person who wants to make their own decisions, who wants to make a rational economic decision. We will stand up for the auto workers and for those who build our sector. We will stand up for the decisions made that are common sense, by the auto sector, by the workers in the auto sector and by every single Canadian who wants to make a decision."
"last week, I joined Representative Chuy Garcia, Representative Jonathan Jackson, and Representative   Danny Davis at the ICE Processing Center in Broadview to investigate ICE's inhumane and unlawful detention of immigrant families and our constituents. The visit to the processing center comes after credible reports that the center is being used to unlawfully detain immigrants, contrary to city and State ordinances, including constituents of the Members who sought entry. The reports suggest that constituents are being housed in the processing center for prolonged periods of time without access to their medication, to legal counsel, or even basic necessities. Let me be very clear. Just because something isn't named a detention facility doesn't mean this administration isn't going to use it as one. If people are detained there, it is a detention facility, period. As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I came to the ICE Processing Center in Broadview to fulfill my congressional oversight authority granted under appropriation laws. Under the law, Members of Congress have the authority to enter any facility operated by the Department of Homeland Security used to detain people. Whether the facility is formally identified as a detention facility is irrelevant. The operational capacity of agents and staff at the facility is also irrelevant when it comes to allowing access to Members of Congress. It is the role of Congress to provide oversight. Let me say that loud and clear for any of my colleagues that are here and that perhaps have forgotten that. It is the role of Congress to provide oversight. I suggest Kristi Noem and DHS staff read section 527(a) of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2024, which is Public Law 118-47. Am I shocked? Let me be honest. I am not shocked. We were illegally denied entry. While we weren't surprised, it was pretty disrespectful for Members of Congress to not be able to do their job. I want my colleagues to visualize this. There are four Members of Congress, all of them showing their ID. In addition to wearing their congressional pins, they are identifying themselves. We ring the doorbell, and we are waiting for about 45 minutes. We wait to gain entry into the facility where no one comes to the door at any given time. No one responds through the intercom. The cameras demonstrate someone is watching us.  {time}  1740  We are waiting there to do the job that we were called to do by law which is to conduct unannounced oversight. When we finally get acknowledged--which, by the way, it meant I saw unmarked cars going in and out of the side gate--as we walked through, we were talking to someone who was unwilling to identify themselves through a little hole through the gate. He refused to identify himself. When we told him we were there, do you know what he said, Mr. Speaker? ``Given guidance by my superiors, I am told that you should send an e-mail to DHS.gov.'' He told four Members of Congress, including a Member of Congress who is the Member of Congress in that jurisdiction of where that holding center is: ``Just send an email.'' Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure that people understand. We have sent emails, and we have sent letters. I want to make sure that the American people understand what is happening to us. We have sent emails, and we have sent letters. We have challenged the illegal, unconstitutional actions of thisauthoritarian government, and we have not received any responses. It is our job as Members of Congress to provide accountability and oversight of activities of the executive branch. Activities that, by the way, this Chamber right here funds through appropriations. Activities that we authorize, or do not, through lawmaking, which is our constitutional role. My favorite part of our interaction that day--1\1/2\ hours of our time outside waiting to be seen--was the sign that staff from the holding center placed on the door which reflects ICE's formal response to our visit. Mr. Speaker, let me tell you what the sign said: ``ICE field offices are not detention facilities and fall outside of the section 527 requirements. ``When planning to visit an ICE facility, ICE asks for requests to be submitted at least 72 hours in advance. Visit requests should be submitted during business hours to the Office of Congressional Relations, (OCR) at CongresstoICE@ice.dhs.gov. Visit requests are not considered actionable until receipt of the request is acknowledged by OCR to the requestor. ``ICE does not house aliens at these locations, rather these are working offices where ERO personnel process aliens to make custody determinations based on the specific circumstances of each case. Aliens determined to require detention are transferred to an ICE detention facility pending removal or the outcome of their removal proceedings. Due to our high operations tempo, we are not facilitating any visits to ICE field offices or suboffices at this time.'' Mr. Speaker, is that unbelievable? Maybe it is. Actually, it is believable because given Noem's disregard for Congress and the rule of law, this is what they do. Mr. Speaker, do you know who makes the laws that govern the DHS facilities? Do you know who makes the laws, Mr. Speaker? It is Congress. Mr. Speaker, do you know who doesn't get to just change the rules when they decide? It is DHS. Mr. Speaker, do you know what is not a valid consideration for denying illegally required oversight? Your operations tempo. You see, Mr. Speaker, as a result of our visit and the visits of Members that they have conducted in New Jersey, California, New York, and Illinois last week, ICE issued new guidance that unlawfully restricts Members of Congress to access ICE facilities. Mr. Speaker, you heard me right. They decided that they were going to issue new guidance to go above Congress and further put a policy in place that is against the law. Two days ago, Ranking Member Bennie Thompson, Ranking Member Jamie Raskin, Subcommittee Ranking Member Lou Correa, and subcommittee Ranking Member Pramila Jayapal, affirmed that Kristi Noem, DHS, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement are illegally obstructing congressional oversight by denying Members of Congress access to multiple facilities used to detain immigrants in recent weeks. Tonight, over the next 45 minutes or so, I will be here with my colleagues talking to the American people about what is happening, and what we are hearing directly from them. My colleagues and I will discuss how we will continue to assert congressional authority, even if Kristi Noem, even if Stephen Miller, and even if RFK and everyone else in that Cabinet attempts to obstruct us from doing our congressional work of congressional authority and legislative action. I will yield to my colleagues who will share how they have attempted to provide oversight despite this hostile administration's lack of respect for Congress as a coequal branch of government and how we are actively defending our communities against this authoritarian agenda. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Carter)."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the warm welcome. I am here on a federal level, and I have actually started conversations with our municipalities and also with our provincial representatives to ensure that we can collaborate and work together for the best interests of Kitchener Centre residents."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of many British Columbians, and certainly all petitioners, who continue to draw attention to the perilous state of wild salmon populations and are looking at the entire food chain and the threat to herring populations, which are also being overfished. The petitioners ask that we at least go back to the recommendations of Mr. Justice Cohen and the report that he tabled, which, after years of study, called for the removal of fish farms. My constituents do not want me to call them that; they have asked me to call them toxic fish factories, and they should be taken out of open waters and placed on land."
"Mr. Chair, the plan is to build more affordable housing across Canada than ever before in Canadian history."
"Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House, we are well aware of the challenges Canadians have with housing affordability. That is why they elected us to represent them and drive the pace of housing construction in Canada. That is what we will do. That is what we will deliver. We have already delivered on the GST break for first-time homebuyers. We are going to take it further and faster."
And it is the rugby league women's cup final on Saturday.
I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from California.
"I rise to thank Troy Buckler, who is retiring on June 30, 2025, after over 37 years of outstanding service to the House of Representatives in the Office of Acquisitions Management. He lives in Seagate, Maryland, and I am proud to represent him here in Congress. Troy was born in Leonardtown Hospital in St. Mary's County and has lived in Maryland his whole life. His parents own Sandgates Restaurant in Sandgates, Maryland, where he spends his leisure time helping out. He has two children and one grandson. He first came to the House in 1988, when he applied for a position in the Office SupplyStore. His job included fulfilling delivery orders to the Cannon and Old O'Neill House Office Buildings. It was a big change for him where he had spent most of his time doing blue collar jobs wearing jeans and T-shirts. He didn't think he would last a week when he started March 28, 1988. It took a lot for him to get used to wearing dress slacks and ties. But here he is 37 years later and looking forward to playing with his grandson, Levi, and not having to commute over 50 miles to work. He held several positions over the years in the Office Supply Store, including stock orders and special orders for Members. During a reorganization realignment in 2009, Troy became a Purchasing Agent under the Office of Acquisitions. His favorite job over the years was doing the deliveries being around people and socializing with Members and staff. Troy's plans for retirement include doing what he wants and having fun. He is looking forward to working at his parents' restaurant and helping his brother who has an electrical business. Now he will have the time to join his parents in Florida during the winter months and also help his brother who shovels snow for the county. Although he has lived his whole life around seafood, pizza is his favorite food and Jim Beam and cranberry juice over the rocks is his favorite drink. He likes football, wrestling, and baseball and roots for the Baltimore Orioles and Washington Commanders. He fondly remembers meeting the team's legendary fullback John Riggins in person. His interests and hobbies include riding his motorcycle and working at his parents' restaurant. Outside of work, he treasures time with his family and is looking forward to more adventures. I congratulate Troy, and I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking him for his distinguished service to the House and the Nation it represents. He has helped the People's House function For The People. I wish him all the best as he begins a new chapter in his life."
"That is a very important point. Whatever the views expressed in the House today, I say to all Members that if any of them want to suggest ways in which we can continue to drive up pension credit and ensure that the poorest pensioners receive the support to which they are entitled, I will always be happy to talk to them."
"One of my constituents told me of her mother's pain in her last few months of suffering. It was so painful that she could not bear to be touched by my constituent or her brother. Now, both my constituent and her brother are facing post-traumatic stress disorder because of the difficult situation they witnessed while their mum was dying. Does my hon. Friend agree that if they had helped her to die in the way that this Bill allows, they should not then be subject to a coroner's investigation? It is not going to help them, and it is not going to help their mother."
"Madam Speaker, I welcome the member for Calgary Signal Hill to this House. He is another Calgary MP. It is great to see him here. I share his thanks to his predecessor, Ron Liepert, who is a good friend and known to all of us in this House. We wish him the best in retirement. The member spoke in response to the last question. I would like to give him more time to fully explain some of the points that he might want to make there. It is not just because in his riding and mine the oil and gas industry, the energy industry, supplies high-paying, good jobs and careers that support families; it supports the entire country. It is the biggest industry in this country and it is where the revenue comes from to fund public services in every province. Does he agree and does he have anything else to add with respect to this important industry?"
"I thank Chairwoman McClain for her leadership. Mr. Speaker, during President Trump's first term, we had progrowth policies, a progrowth economy, and tax revenue growth. Even after COVID, the Biden administration accelerated the deficit with unchecked spending, causing the deficit to double, which increased service on the debt from $400 billion in 2019 to nearly $1 trillion last year. That is why this package takes steps to rein in irresponsible agencies. Some have been taken over by ideologues doing things that are simply not in the interest of the American people. Maybe USAID has done some good things, but they have also done many things that were totally inappropriate. Agencies like this need to be defunded or reformed. The American people aren't going to put up with it anymore. To that end, why is the government still funding public television and radio when most people have hundreds of channels to get their news and information from and when these stations are some of the most partisan stations out there? Can you imagine, as was stated earlier, if a conservative station was funded? The left would have screamed, vilified, and exterminated it a long while ago. Mr. Speaker, let's pass this rescissions package, codify President Trump's spending reductions into law, and save our country along the way. Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. Boebert)."
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Louis-Saint-Laurent—Akiawenhrahk for his excellent speech. I need to come clean. I do not have an electric car, but I do not have a gas-powered car either. I have a hybrid car, and I am a Conservative. Now, I would like my colleague to talk about the impact on consumers. Apparently this could cost an extra $20,000. Can my colleague talk about the fact that consumers will be on the hook for that? Given the current economic context, I think our friends opposite seem uncaring."
"I completely agree with my hon. Friend. I know that he will do what he can to promote his constituency, and the extra funding for the British Business Bank will really support his area."
"I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments. The safety of road users, be they vehicle users, cyclists, pedestrians or mobility scooter users, needs to be at the heart of decision making on speed cameras. I agree that safety rather than revenue needs to be at the centre of any decisions. In my constituency of Hazel Grove, the danger is real and it is happening right now. Motion lapsed (Standing Order No. Motion made, and Question proposed, That this House do now adjourn.--(Martin McCluskey.)"
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to join in by heaping more praise on the member's speech in French. I remember that he hardly spoke any French back when I met him in 2019, so I congratulate him for making the effort. We can correct each other if he is interested in continuing. My question is very simple. Could my colleague confirm for me, yes or no, whether the consumer carbon tax payment was paid out in advance or after the fact? All the analysts say that it was paid out in advance. If it was paid in advance and—"
"Mr. Speaker, I am going to split my time. This might be a new Parliament and a new Prime Minister , but we are tackling the same old problems with the exact same fraught solutions, and we have heard a lot about that today. What is worse is that the Liberal government cannot even admit the failures that every single Canadian now, no matter whom they voted for, can see exist. I am going to cut right to it. The current government broke the Canadian immigration system. It broke the 100-year consensus of our system, and it has taken a system that was once the envy of the world, of so many people who have come to call Canada home, and made it a system that is now rife with abuse and incompetence. Frankly, it was not that way 10 years ago. The vast majority of Canadians, and any rational person, would look at this and say the exact same thing: The immigration system needs fixing. We need something to restore the trust and integrity that it once had. However, now we have an immigration minister who cannot answer the most basic questions. In fact, there are members on the other side of the House who spoke today who probably read the legislation, who were at committee, and who have answered every single question better than she could. I learned that first-hand last week when the minister could not say how many people we have welcomed to Canada. She could not tell us whether they would ever complete proper security checks. She could not tell us who was going to leave, when they were going to leave nor how they were going to do that. It seems like members of the Liberal government at this point are crossing their fingers. They are throwing anybody who has not yet been in the role of the immigration minister into the fight, hoping the problems just go away. That does not make our country safe. It does not ensure that people can access health care. It does not give people the opportunity to find jobs, does not help them find homes and does not keep the offenders or, frankly, terrorists from entering our country. Members may have noticed that the most reasonable people in this country on immigration are no longer walking on eggshells about the issue. They have called it out for what it is: a deeply broken system that the government over the last 10 years broke. Here is what I have to say to the seven ministers in 10 years who have added to the breaking of the system in Canada and the consensus we once had with the system: The bill does not solve the problems that it was intended to solve. It actually creates more of them. That is what we need to ensure that the House understands. Immigration levels have been far too high for the last number of years. I certainly think so. Municipal leaders think so. Provincial premiers think so. Even non-partisan civil servants think so. They have said as much. The proposed fix cannot be to have 100,000 people become citizens with a stroke of a pen or a vote of the House. Maybe it is 100,000; the government does not even know the number. We have heard multiple estimates from multiple members on the other side. That is irresponsible. Bill C-3 talks about citizenship for people who have hardly spent any time in this country, just 36 months, which do not have to be consecutive. That is the number one problem with it. What about security screenings? We have not talked a lot in the House about security screenings, the ones that the minister could not describe last week. She did not even know what they entailed. Bill C-3 would extend citizenship without basic security checks, without a single background check and without a single interview. What about the backlog in our system that we have not talked much about? It has kept literally millions of people in line for years. The backlog of asylum claimants alone is nearly 300,000, while the citizenship backlog is about a million. Bill C-3 would obviously add to that backlog. There needs to be concern about a system that has lost all of its integrity and has lost the confidence of Canadians. We would want to ensure that the backlog does not get worse. Our own budget watchdog tells us that it will take $21 million, but he is handicapped on understanding the bill, as they do not know the numbers, how many it would affect, or how this would happen. However, those are all secondary issues. Not only is the bill far away from what this country needs on immigration, but it is also a big step in the wrong direction. I think it would make the problems that the Liberals have created over the last number of years worse, so nobody should be celebrating. I will make this clear: Nobody should be celebrating that our immigration system is broken. It has built this country. It has ensured that people like my parents can come here and flee the place that they do not even want to talk about anymore for a new life in Canada, where their first-generation child can become a member of Parliament, something that they would never have dreamed of. It is resilient. It makes our country unique, and it is part of our cultural and economic strength. The country needs immigration, but it also needs to work for Canadians and to work for Canada. Right now, it does neither of those things. It works for nobody. It does not work for the young people, the old people, the first generation or the sixth generation. It does not work for people who cannot afford a home, people who cannot get in to see a doctor when they need one, people who cannot get a job when they have to or the people who have spent years languishing in lines, waiting their turn without any idea of when any of this would actually happen. It does not help the people who were scammed by the fake colleges or foreign-cash-addicted universities that, under the watch and the encouragement of the government, have gotten out of control. It does not serve the people who came here for the promise of this country. About 40% of our newcomers already say that they want to leave. We cannot pretend that using a hammer, in this case, is going to fix something that could be fixed with a scalpel. Based on this, it should come as no surprise that, despite promising a lower amount of newcomers, the government is still issuing a record number of permits. This year, there have been nearly 100,000 study permits and 50,000 temporary work permits. This should be expected from an immigration minister who told this country, in her previous job as the immigration minister for Nova Scotia, that she wanted absolutely no caps on immigration. She has denied that. It is not a great track record to engender confidence in the new seventh minister in 10 years. If the members opposite actually want to take an interest in making this better, I have some advice to make it better. While we do need to fix the wrongs of the past, the former bill did that. If there are elements and specific cases where it did not, we could find ways to do it with a very targeted approach. We supported fixing the lost Canadians via the targeted bill that we saw from the other place, Bill S-245 , but Bill C-3 goes too far. Bill C-3 actually weakens Canadian citizenship. It would devalue Canadian citizenship for everyone else. It would open the door by eliminating the ties to Canada as a requirement, or at least the strength of the ties to Canada as a requirement. It would eliminate the first-generation limit. It would grant citizenship to those born abroad with one parent who has spent 1,095 consecutive days here. We have heard a lot of conversation about this, and I am glad to hear that the members opposite, the Liberals, are open to amendments to changing that, to substantiating it into a test that makes sense. They are not required to have substantial ties. Again, the vague substantial connection test allows multi-generational foreign residents to claim citizenship with minimal presence in Canada. That devalues the citizenship. It devalues not only the rights that are afforded to every other citizen but also the responsibility that citizens have in making sure that they are citizens. I want to make Canada's immigration system the envy of the world. We cannot do that if Canadians do not believe in the integrity of the system. We cannot do that if we look out onto our streets today and see what is happening, while we are saying no to security vetting, to any kind of interview or to making sure that criminal record checks are conducted. We cannot possibly stand up today in this country and say that is not necessary. I look forward to hearing what the Liberals' thoughts are on an amendment that would ensure security and vetting are taken seriously, something that the Liberals have not done in our immigration system. It is something that has played out on our streets here in Canada, something that has been shown in case after case of people being charged before they committed a terrorist act in this country. I want to see a government take this responsibly, and I want to see citizenship mean something in this country. We have a bill without its amendments and the provisions the government currently has with the minister , who knows nothing about the bill, who has presented it in the House. I want to see those changed. I look forward to having that conversation, but I look forward more to the Liberals accepting those amendments."
"I thank my right hon. Friend for her question, and she is absolutely right. The need to de-escalate was the central focus going into the weekend and coming out of it, and I am very pleased that we have reached a ceasefire in relation to the conflict in Iran. We absolutely need that to hold. My right hon. Friend is absolutely right about the soft convening power of the United Kingdom. It is an incredible asset and, yes, I can confirm that we are working with others in relation to Russian disinformation and cyber-attacks, which, as the House knows, are a regular occurrence."
"I rise to recognize Sister Teresa Lynch, who will be retiring from Santa Ana's Saint Anne School. She served as a teacher for 31 years and principal for 19 years at Saint Genevieve and Saint Anne School. She also worked to improve the lives of incarcerated prisoners at the California Institute for Women in Chino, California. She also co-directed the Get on the Bus program that connected children with their incarcerated parents. Mr. Speaker, I thank Sister Teresa for showing us all what it means to care for the community. I thank her for her friendship. I congratulate Sister Teresa on her retirement. I suspect now, as a retiree, she will be busier than ever."
"I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for the interest that she has taken with the China audit. I did say that I would update the Committee, and I look forward to appearing before it and taking questions on this subject. In completing the audit, it has been important to remain consistent with our Five Eyes partners. She will recognise why much of the audit has led to a high level of classification. She will note, when she looks across the G7 and other Five Eyes partners, that many of them have handled their approach to China in the way that I have set out. I refer her to the strategic defence review and its contents on China. I refer her to the national security strategy, which has just been published, and its references to China. I also refer her to the UK's industrial strategy and its references to China, alongside the statement that I have just made."
"Labour's historic mission is to help more people who can work into good jobs in every part of the land. That is not only because we believe that is key to improving living standards, but because of the self-respect, dignity and purpose that good work brings. The right to try is an important step--we know that around 50% of sick and disabled people say that the reason they are not trying work is because they fear they will be reassessed for their benefits. We have got to put that right. We have also got to put in place the employment support. We have to create good jobs in every part of the country, and get those waiting lists down so that people can get back to health and back to work. We are taking action on all those fronts, and I look forward to working with my hon. Friend in his constituency so that more of his constituents can benefit."
"Mr Mayhew, to be clear, nothing has happened that is out of order. Your point is more one of frustration than process and procedure, and it is not a point of order for the Chair."

"Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to be standing here today to give my first-ever speech as a member of Parliament. Let me first start off by thanking the incredible people of my riding of North Island—Powell River. I am here first and foremost because of the trust they have placed in me to be their voice and their elected representative in this esteemed chamber. This is something for which I will always be grateful and which I will never forget. It has been almost two years now since I first decided to seek the Conservative Party nomination and run in the last election. It was a decision I made because I believed then, as I do now, that this country was headed in the wrong direction, that it was failing to live up to its true potential and that it was sleepwalking toward a fiscal and cultural cliff. I think there is no better example of that than the fiscal mismanagement we have seen of our country. When I worked at the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, I used to tour a debt clock right across the country. It showed how much the federal government had borrowed and how much debt it was leaving to future generations to pay for. It was a great tool to help people visualize just how much we were leaving the next generation to pay for. That particular debt clock no longer exists, because under the Liberals and the NDP, we have managed to borrow more money in the last 10 years than all other governments in the history of this country combined, and we literally ran out of digits on the clock. Of course, all this spending, borrowing and printing of money has other consequences as well. We have seen the highest inflation in more than 30 years, as everything, especially homes, has become less affordable. There used to be a promise here in Canada: If people worked hard, paid their taxes and followed the law, they could afford a place to live. When my grandfather, who is now 94 years old, first came to Canada in 1957 as a refugee, he, like most new Canadians, started off with a minimum-wage job working on the railway. On that minimum-wage job, he was able to afford a home and a nice piece of property right on Vancouver Island and have it paid off in less than 10 years. Does anyone think one could afford a home and have it paid off in less than 10 years while earning minimum wage anywhere in Canada today? I do not think so. This is the result of too much government, too much regulation and too much bureaucracy. It is time to remove the gatekeepers and start building things in this country again. This also means supporting our incredible resource sector and resource sector workers, who have been under constant attack from the Liberals and the NDP. On the North Island, where I live, forestry is down by a third; aquaculture has been cut in half; fishermen have had their access barred to areas they have fished sustainably for more than a hundred years; and the last mine on Vancouver Island closed as well. On energy, the Liberal record is even worse: axing the northern gateway pipeline, telling our allies in Korea, Germany and Greece that there is no business case for Canadian LNG, and introducing legislation like Bill C-69 , which killed dozens of massive energy and resource projects and led to tens of billions of dollars in investment fleeing to the United States, and for what? Was it just so these jobs can leave our country, for China, for India, for the U.S., for countries with lower environmental standards than our own? These are Canadian workers who have had their livelihoods, their ability to put food on the table to feed their families, sacrificed by the Liberals and the NDP on the altar of this green ideology. Here is the truth: No one does safety and environmental stewardship better than Canada or better than Canadians, and as long as the world needs lumber, minerals, or oil and natural gas, as much of it as possible should come from right here in Canada. We also have to rebuild our military. We have our amazing men and women in uniform flying combat aircraft that are more than 40 years old, to say nothing of the state of our submarines. Our men and women in uniform, as amazing as they are, find a way to make it work; they really do. However, it should not be up to them to become the world's experts in using old, rusted-out equipment. They deserve better than that. There is maybe no issue where the Liberals and the NDP have done more damage, from a human perspective, than their mismanagement of the addictions crisis. First, they decriminalized hard drugs, including fentanyl, crystal meth and crack cocaine, and then they used taxpayer money to flood the streets with a highly addictive and deadly opioid called hydromorphone, or Dilaudid, while marketing it to our young people as safe supply. This is all part of their plan known as harm reduction. As a result, since 2015, more than 50,000 Canadians have died from drug overdoses. That is more Canadians dead than those who died in the entire Second World War. That does not sound much like harm reduction to me. They say the definition of insanity is to keep doing the same thing while expecting a different result, so how about instead of handing out free drugs, we get our fellow Canadians into treatment, get them into recovery and return them to being healthy, productive members of our society again? At the same time, we need to repeal the soft-on-crime Liberal legislation, like Bill C-75 and Bill C-5 , that has reduced jail time for serious offenders and granted near automatic bail for career criminals. In fact, it seems the only people who are ever punished for anything anymore under the Liberals and the NDP are those who actually work for a living and follow the law, whether it is our law-abiding firearms owners, who have been targeted and demonized by their own government; small business owners, who have been taxed and regulated to the point of insolvency; or resource workers, who have had their jobs threatened, their careers denigrated and, in some cases, their livelihoods destroyed. Right now, in Canada in so many ways, it feels as if right side up is upside down and common sense no longer exists. That brings me to the cultural erosion that we have seen, the tearing down of statues, the erasing of our history. I was in Victoria the day this corrosive ideology all began, when they toppled the monument to the man who built this country, without whom Canada would not even exist. The truth is that this country has so much to celebrate and so much to be proud of. We owe an infinite debt of gratitude to all those who came before us, like the prime ministers, both Liberal and Conservative, whose portraits are hanging just outside these chamber walls. They laid the foundation for what would become and for what still is the greatest country in the world. They laid the foundation by being bold, by being daring and by getting things done. In the late 1800s, Canada was a small country divided by language and religion and surrounded by a larger and much more powerful neighbour to the south, yet in that historical context, we completed what many consider to be this country's greatest engineering and political feat: the Canadian Pacific Railway. Championed by Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, most do not know that the bulk of the work took just four years to complete through some of the most difficult and expansive terrain in the world, across the Canadian Shield and through the Canadian Rockies. It was the key to bringing my province, British Columbia, into Confederation. Can members imagine, in the current political, regulatory and cultural climate of today, if we tried as a nation to undertake a similar feat? Instead of championing these kinds of nation-building projects, the government today seems to be actively plotting against them, but it does not have to be this way. Macdonald dreamed big, Sir Wilfrid Laurier dreamed big as well and we can dream big once again. The truth is that the silver lining to this problem lies in its solution. We do not need the government to step up in any particular way. We just need the government to get out of the way and give this country back to those who built it, the people. That begins where this country draws its greatest sources of strength: the wealth of its resources and the ingenuity of its citizens. I intend to do my part to always be a voice for the hard-working citizens of my riding in this incredible country, to always be unapologetically proud to be Canadian and to always be guided, no matter what, by what is true and what is right, not by what is politically correct."
"I will not rehearse the arguments on recognition, but I know that so many hon. Members, myself included, have met hostage families who view the events with terrible dismay. I will not put words in their mouths from the Dispatch Box. Their views are varied, their distress and their anger are palpable, and we have them in our thoughts every day."
"Madam Speaker, anyone who has been involved in private business knows that what we really need to make a project successful is predictability and to know what the rules are. We have seen time and time again that the Liberals move the goalposts halfway through the game. With Bill C-5 , they are doing exactly the same thing. Can the member explain why he thinks this bill is a good idea and why we should not just scrap the bills before it, which caused all these problems in the first place?"
"I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention, which is easy for me to respond to--yes, I agree wholeheartedly. Since October 2023 there have been at least 14 shipments of military goods from the UK to Israel. Those include over 8,500 munitions, bombs, grenades, missiles, and 146 armoured vehicle parts. In October 2023 alone, the UK exported 150,000 bullets."
"Order. I now have to move on to topical questions. There will be disappointment for hon. Members whose questions are next on the Order Paper, but that is because of the way questions have been grouped. We really do need to think about why we are grouping questions that are not relevant to each other."
"I draw the attention of the House to my being the founder of Labour: Women in Tech and the co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on financial technology, and to my career in data and technology prior to becoming an MP. I welcome the Government's new approach to innovate and expedite the process and to leverage the expertise of both Houses and key stakeholders. I thank them for their work on that. Just under a month ago, the UK hosted FinTech Week and the global fintech forum, where businesses and Government leaders from around the world came to participate in critical conversations about the importance of the trusted global financial services ecosystem for the physical and digital worlds. Attendance was so senior and strong because after the global financial crisis the UK had to move quickly to a new model, and hence fintech was born. A lot of great work was done in this space by the Conservatives when they were in government, even if they could not get their act together over AI and keep the attention of AI companies. Government regulators, incumbents, entrepreneurs and investors worked together with alacrity to create an ecosystem that led the world into fintech. We created tens of thousands of new jobs, brought in tens of millions in inward investment and created more than 20 billion-dollar companies. We are in the middle of London Tech Week, which is happening a few miles away at Olympia and was attended by the Prime Minister. There is a technology challenge in the creative industries that needs addressing now, which is why it is great to hear the news today. This is an emergency, and the emergence of AI in recent times has created opportunity and new threats for creatives, who rightly worry that their work is often appropriated by AI without reward or recognition. However, we can be a pioneer in this field, developing trusted solutions that protect creatives and set the standards that others will follow. We have demonstrated our ability to do that in the past with fintech, in which the UK holds a 10% global market share. The UK's secret sauce is a unique blend of not just our brilliant talent, light-touch regulation, common business language and soft power, but our common law, which is used by other countries. We are an exemplar. Other countries look to us to lead the way. A crisis is at the door, but we have an opportunity to be on the front foot, ahead of other countries experiencing the same challenges and watching us closely. This country always steps up in times of crisis. The UK can and must take a leading position on the fair use of AI in the creative industries and help to protect our creatives and their work, which are rightly celebrated across the world. Engagement with global players in the ecosystem is important, but we should also be far more focused on the UK's home-grown talent and inventive mindset to solve the biggest puzzles. We can move quickly when we need to, and my message to the Secretary of State and to this House is that we really need to, and have to."
"I join my hon. Friend in hoping that everybody who goes to the horse fair in his constituency does so for the right reasons and because they want to celebrate that event, rather than to cause criminality or antisocial behaviour--I am sure we all recognise that. We want to take steps to clamp down on antisocial behaviour and give the police more powers to do that, and that is what our Crime and Policing Bill will do. I hope that everything passes off well for his constituents."
"I rise today to congratulate Augusta radio host Austin Rhodes on the recent announcement that he will be inducted into the Georgia Radio Hall of Fame. For over 30 years, Austin has been a consistent and dependable voice as the host of the ``Austin Rhodes Show'' on WGAC, making it one of Georgia's longest running weekday drive-time talk shows. Nearly 3 years ago, I stood before this body to recognize Austin's 30th year anniversary in broadcasting, and it is my honor to stand here once again to mark yet another achievement in his long career. During my time in Congress, I have had the pleasure of joining Austin'sshow on many occasions to discuss key issues impacting our Nation and the CSRA. I will always appreciate Austin's flexibility, willingness to have important conversations, and most of all his ability to tell it like he sees it. I congratulate Austin on this well-deserved honor. I have no doubt that he will continue to be our afternoon voice on the airways for many years to come."
"Mr. Chair, the question, again, is this: Is the government planning a major overhaul of the indigenous procurement program?"
"When you cut out the blather, is not the reality that this Labour Government have condemned us to higher taxes, more debt, fewer jobs and more pain for businesses up and down our country? Borrowing, unemployment and inflation are up, yet the right hon. Lady tells us that the Government's plan is working. It is not just me who is not convinced; the Members behind her are not convinced either. Nor are the public. In fact, I am not even sure whether the right hon. Lady herself is convinced. Is she not just a little embarrassed to defend policies that she does not even agree with?"
"Madam Chair, I would like the minister to clarify his thoughts on exit controls for foreign nationals. It is not right that there are foreign nationals in this country but we do not know where. We also do not know when they leave the country. What I really want the minister to clarify is what he is going to do to improve the situation. Is he satisfied with the current measures? Is he not aware that he needs to implement new controls for foreign nationals to properly screen people leaving Canada? I would like him to tell me very specifically how he is going to address this gap."
"Mr. Speaker, does either minister over there currently support the electric vehicle mandate and the digital services tax that the government imposed last Parliament?"
"The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross has described the situation in Gaza today as worse than hell on earth, but the Minister has come to the House today with a message that is exactly the same as it was two weeks ago. He condemns the settlements, but settlement goods are still being sold in our shops. He supports a two-state solution, but he has not recognised a Palestinian state. He disagrees with the Israeli Government, but he will not sanction their extremist Ministers. It is clear that the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu are not listening to the Minister's words. In the context of the slaughter and starvation we are seeing in Gaza, the Government's position is, frankly, not good enough. When will there be further action?"
"Madam Speaker, I apologize. I would like to ask my colleague from Winnipeg West the following question. The member made comments on the health care system and how he was very thankful that it exists in Canada the way it is today. What would he say about the measures this government has put in place to help support Canadian families with respect to health care?"
"I thank the Chair of the Select Committee for his remarks. As a member of the Committee, I can attest to our dismay at what we heard in those hearings. I ask the Chair to encourage Dame Vera Baird to take a robust approach to her review of the leadership of such an important public body."
"we are here today to ensure the Senate fulfills its constitutional duties regarding the sole power to involve our Nation in war. An important briefing will take place tomorrow and, perhaps, a vote on this very issue. Article I, section 8 of the U.S. Constitution clearly states that the power to declare war is an explicit power of Congress. Three words: to declare war. Congress overwhelmingly reaffirmed this constitutional provision when it passed the War Powers Act in 1973 over the veto of President Nixon. Under the War Powers Act, the President has the authority to approve military attacks as a response to an imminent threat or with the express authorization of Congress. Neither of these were the case with President Trump's decision to bomb Iran over the weekend. The Iranian regime sponsors terrorism; wants to destroy Israel and undermine U.S. interests; oppress its own people; and is interested in owning a nuclear weapon. But those are not justifications to ignore the Constitution. If the United States is to start a war with Iran over these or any other issue, the Constitution itself requires it must be with the consent of Congress. Let me also add that we had an effective agreement that contained Iran's nuclear program--I remember it well under President Obama--that is, until President Trump, in his first term, abruptly withdrew the United States from this agreement, adding to the more volatile situation which we face today. That is why I support the Senator from Virginia Tim Kaine's War Powers Resolution. It requires a prompt debate and vote prior to using additional U.S. military force against Iran. This Senate should not allow the country to be led into another Middle Eastern war without its consent. When I reflect on the time that I have served in the Senate, one of the most memorable votes was on the question of the invasion of Iraq. If the Presiding Officer will recall that debate, the argument was being made by the White House that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that we had to preemptively start a war with that country to stop those weapons from being used against us or our allies. We know what happened. There was a vote on the floor of the Senate. It was about 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock at night. There were 23 of us who voted against the invasion of Iraq--one Republican and 22 Democrats. I believe it was the best vote I ever cast as a Senator. There were no weapons of mass destruction. We were invading a country under a false premise. We were going to wage a war there and, unfortunately, did at the expense of American lives for a long period of time. This Senate should not be led into another war in the Middle East without the consent of the American people through Congress. Our Founders knew this point: One should never send our sons and daughters into war without the consent of the American people--an argument I have made regardless of who the President has been of either party. We have already ceded too much congressional power on so many different subjects. I am almost speechless, which is something for a Senator. We are at a point where Congress continues to give away its power and its authority. I don't know how to explain it. I don't know why people would go through the awful challenge of running for office to serve in the U.S. Senate while each and every President tries to take away our authority to appropriate funds, for example; to make critical decisions. And so many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are willing to give that away to their favorite President. Well, when you give away that authority, the next President may not be your favorite, but he will have the authority that you ceded and gave away to your favorite President. We have already ceded too much in appropriations and key items. Let's not do that when it comes to war."
"If the Conservatives had won a 15th year in government, would they have started to tackle this epidemic?"
"Mr. Speaker, I heard various scenarios directly from the residents of London—Fanshawe at the door. For example, a constituent, a 65-year-old nurse, broke into tears when I knocked on the door. She broke down when she told me how exhausted she had been under the previous Liberal government, telling me about her inability to afford life. Because of the government, she and her husband are living paycheque to paycheque, unable to even think about retirement. The government failed her and millions of Canadians like her."
"Mr. Speaker, as I rise today to make my first statement in this House, I want to take a moment to recognize and thank the constituents of Oakville West who have honoured me by electing me to speak in the House on their behalf. I also want to thank my team and volunteers, who helped me to get elected and to stand here today. I thank the member for Winnipeg Centre for bringing this important issue to debate this evening. Like many Canadians, I have been watching the media reports and images of the wildfires in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and my heart goes out to everyone who is impacted. I can only imagine the devastation and the heartbreak they are feeling about having to leave their homes and the uncertainty that the next days and weeks will bring. To the first responders who are fighting these fires, there are not enough words to thank them properly for the job they do. Every time there is a wildfire, they put life and limb on the line to keep our communities and their residents safe. I thank them for their courage, dedication and commitment. I want to reassure Canadians and my hon. colleagues in this House that the government takes seriously its responsibility to keep our communities safe. Indeed, it has responded quickly to provide assistance and support. The Government of Canada remains committed to working with provinces, territories and whole-of-society partners to prevent, prepare for, respond to and recover from emergencies across the country. The Prime Minister spoke with the Premier of Manitoba, Wab Kinew, on May 28 and is providing Canada's full support as Manitoba battles wildfires. The premier and the Prime Minister are in close contact, and the federal government is assisting Manitoba's provincial wildfire team. The government, via Indigenous Services Canada and across the board, has engaged with the impacted indigenous communities. The Minister of Emergency Management approved two requests for federal assistance from the Government of Manitoba, which were received late in the evening on May 28, to support evacuation efforts in response to the wildfires threatening these first nations communities. Government of Canada departments have been working closely together on our response. Public Safety Canada's Government Operations Centre, which supports preparedness for and leads the coordination of the integrated federal response to all hazard events of national interest, is currently coordinating the federal response to the situation in western Canada. The Government Operations Centre is working with the Canadian Armed Forces, Canadian Coast Guard, Indigenous Services Canada and other federal and provincial partners to coordinate the response and deploy all necessary resources. The Government Operations Centre maintains continuous communication with our federal, provincial and territorial partners, including indigenous communities, throughout the cyclical event season on a 24-7-365 basis. Every year, the Government Operations Centre works to deploy risk assessments for cyclical events such as floods, wildland fires and hurricanes, and shares with key partners that hold emergency management responsibilities. This year again, the wildland fire forecast indicated the potential for elevated fire activity in western and central Canada due to ongoing drought conditions and above-normal temperatures. On a broader scale, the government has a number of measures in place to mitigate the risk of natural disasters as well as to respond. For example, Canada's federal-provincial-territorial emergency management strategy outlines a coordinated approach focused on proactive measures to prevent and mitigate the impacts of disasters before they occur, and the Government of Canada is committed to building resilience to these hazards. This is why the government launched the national adaptation strategy, aimed to support a shared vision for a resilient Canada. The Government of Canada is also there to support communities after large-scale natural disasters. For over 50 years, the disaster financial assistance arrangements program has played a critical role in supporting the cost of large-scale disasters caused by natural hazards in Canada. Public Safety Canada launched a modernized disaster financial assistance arrangements program on April 1, 2025. The modernized program is the culmination of over four years of extensive collaboration. Public Safety Canada continues to work closely with provinces and territories to ensure a smooth transition to the new DFAA. Our modernized DFAA prioritizes greater resilience and reduces disaster risk to Canadians. It empowers provinces and territories to develop tailored solutions, increased flexible funding and expanded post-disaster supports. This initiative will help to reduce the long-term costs and impacts of disasters on all Canadians. While there has not yet been a request by provinces impacted by the current wildfires, assistance through the disaster financial assistance arrangements program will be there should they decide to make a request. The modernized DFAA covers costs for wildfires that directly threaten communities, also known as wildland-urban interface fires. Response costs; repairing, restoring and rebuilding uninsurable infrastructure; improvements to damaged infrastructure; new community or region-wide mitigation projects; and recovery supports like legal, financial or mental health counselling can be cost-shared under the disaster financial assistance arrangements program, to improve the resilience of communities that have suffered a disaster. With this new program, mitigation funding is available for any eligible disaster type under the DFAA. Therefore, provinces and territories that suffer a disaster stemming from a natural hazard, such as a wildfire, and are eligible for DFAA funding can use the DFAA to increase the resilience of the affected communities. We know natural disasters are increasing in their frequency and severity. As such, the government is continually looking at ways it can improve mitigation strategies, emergency management response and resilience. Any one of us could be impacted by a natural disaster at any time. While natural disasters are by their very nature unpredictable, improved coordination, risk mitigation, rapid response and preparedness strategies can help minimize their impact. In conclusion, I want to reassure the impacted communities that the government stands with them, ready to help. We are doing, and will do, all we can."
"Mr. Speaker, my colleague talked about the Liberal culture of delay. In my experience, it takes a long time to change a culture. It takes time. It takes more than words, spoken or written. Culture changes through action. What action are you going to take? It takes time."
The hon. member.
"I pay tribute to Cumbernauld's advanced manufacturing capability. It is estimated that the UK-India free trade agreement will boost the whole UK economy by PS4.8 billion and grow trade with India by over PS25 billion annually. The Scotch Whisky Association  forecasts PS1 billion in extra exports and 1,200 new jobs. For Irn-Bru, which I understand is headquartered in my hon. Friend's constituency, the agreement also removes India's 33% tariffs on UK soft drinks. This India deal was delivered in the UK as a result of the hard work of our negotiators and the leadership of the Secretary of State, and it will benefit exporters and advanced manufacturers right across our country."
"Madam Chair, as I said, in the tariff world, things move very quickly. If the member wants to make a prediction, I am sure Canadians are willing to listen to him on—"
"My hon. Friend is a great champion for Derby and many Members across this House can understand the acute pressures he mentions. The fact is we have not been building enough homes, and we certainly have not been building enough social homes. Therefore, we have already set out some steps, as I mentioned briefly earlier, around the right to buy receipts, and we are consulting on new long-term rent settlements to give providers confidence to build, and we will be investing billions of pounds into social housing. I cannot pre-empt the spending review this week but the Chancellor will set out more then."
"Mr. Speaker, I hope you are sitting comfortably, because this is kind of complicated. The Prime Minister gave Canadians a refund for money they did not pay. It was actually an advance, but they will never pay back that advance. Nearly $4 billion was distributed to Canadians one week before the election, but Quebeckers did not get a penny. Can the Prime Minister explain that to Quebeckers?"
"Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member on his re-election. One thing I did not hear about in his comments was crime. I met a lady yesterday and was chatting with her, and I asked how her day went. She said it was a day from hell because she had to call the the police three times to have people removed from her business. I wonder if the member recognizes the impact the Liberals have had as far as crime getting out of control goes. Does he support jail, not bail for repeat offenders? Would he repeal Bill C-5 and Bill C-75 ?"
I ask for the yeas and nays.
"Madam Chair, the Canadian canola industry is facing 100% tariffs from China and 25% tariffs from the Americans. When will these trade issues be resolved?"
"The hon. Gentleman is right, in that we had ambitious plans in our manifesto to create thousands of jobs funded through Great British Energy--something that he failed to vote for, so he is now against the investment that will come. We have secured PS40 billion-worth of private investment since we came to office, with hundreds of jobs and many, many thousands to come."
"I rise today to honor Oscar Renteria on his selection by the Napa Valley Grapegrowers as the 2025 Napa Valley Grower of the Year. This award recognizes Mr. Renteria's steadfast commitment to sustainable farming, agricultural preservation, and community leadership, all of which have left a lasting impact on our Napa Valley grapegrowing community. Born in St. Helena, Mr. Renteria graduated from St. Mary's College in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration. Shortly after graduation, he joined his family's business, Renteria Vineyard Management, founded two year's earlier by his father Salvador Renteria, a respected vineyard worker who became a leading entrepreneur in our Napa Valley. While Mr. Renteria originally focused on administrative work, he quickly became engaged in the hands-on aspects of viticulture. By 1993 he had assumed proprietorship of the business, working directly with the company's prestigious clients. In 1995, following his father's retirement, Mr. Renteria was named President of Renteria Vineyard Management. Under Mr. Renteria's leadership the company has grown to become one of the largest and most trusted vineyard management firms in the North Bay, with the company managing over 2,200 vineyard acres, nearly 80 full time employees, and 400 seasonal workers. In 1997, Mr. Renteria founded the Renteria family's wine brand, Tres Perlas Wines, a boutique wine label producing limited-production wines. As President of Renteria Vineyard Management, and owner of Tres Perlas Wines, Mr. Renteria has championed environmentally responsible farming practices that elevate our Napa Valley's global reputation for premium viticulure. Mr. Renteria has committed his companies to environmental stewardship by utilizing the latest innovations in equipment, tools, software, fruit analysis, imaging, and data analysis. These resources enable precision farming and help his team respond effectively to the increasing challenges posed by climate change. Mr. Renteria is also dedicated to supporting the farmworkers who work alongside him through leadership development, education, and legal assistance. Through his company's Farmworker Concierge Service, Renteria Vineyard Management offers services such as driver's license assistance, document translation, housing support, citizenship guidance, notary services, English literacy classes, and high school scholarships for employees. Mr. Renteria's leadership extends into community and philanthropic work. He currently serves on the boards of the Napa Valley Grapegrowers, the Napa Valley Farmworker Foundation, and the St. Helena Hospital Foundation. His previous service includes roles with the Napa Valley Community Foundation and serving on the Board of Trustees of his alma mater, Justin-Siena High School. Mr. Renteria has also made significant contributions to nonprofit organizations that support educational opportunities for farmworker's and their families. His philanthropy has benefited institutions such as the Blue Oak School and the Napa Valley Community Foundation, empowering underserved communities and creating lasting opportunities for advancement and growth. Outside of the wine community, Mr. Renteria is husband to Denise Renteria, and they are the proud parents of three daughters Isabella, Mia, and Gabriella. He is widely appreciated for his sense of humor, strong personal values, and wholehearted commitment to both his family and his work. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Renteria is a community member we should all strive to be. His passion for viticulture and dedication to his grape growing community make him deserving of the 2025 Napa Valley Grower of the Year. It is therefor fitting and proper that we honor Oscar Renteria here today."
"when Americans turn on their TV sets and see what is happening on the streets of Los Angeles, I believe the American people feel sickened, horrified, and outraged. Yet we stood here and saw the minority leader of the U.S. Senate come to this floor this morning and he said that these were overwhelmingly peaceful. Nancy Pelosi yesterday said they were just moments of exuberance. Do they not see the news? Do they not watch the news? Let's look at the New York Times front-page story. This is a burning police car. These are people on an overhead looking down on it. The headline is ``Protesters burned a Highway Patrol vehicle . . . in Los Angeles.'' Peaceful protests? Absolutely not. These are riots. They threaten the public safety, and my Democrat colleagues call them peaceful. I have been saying for the last 4 years the Democrats are wrong on this, that, and the next thing, and this is something that the American people absolutely understand: The Democrats are wrong. These are not peaceful. These are attacks upon the law enforcement community of our Nation, and Republicans will not stand by as the violence rages in our country's second largest city. The California Governor and Los Angeles mayor--call them out: Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass--are unable and unwilling to restore the law. They refuse. They have coddled the criminals from day one, and many of these criminals are illegal immigrants. But who do Democrats stand by again and again and again? They stand by the guy on the roof of the burning car waving a Mexican flag instead of standing with law-abiding citizens who just want to live a life with safety. That is what the American people want--safety, prosperity. It is not what the Democrats are standing for, no. Americans are seeing local police officers as well as members of Immigrations and Custom Enforcement being brutally attacked with rocks, with bricks, with bottles, with concrete. Additionally, looters are using the unrest to break into local businesses. Oh, yeah, the police are occupied. Let's break into local businesses, including gas stations, the Apple store, jewelry stores. Let's go where the money is. The mayor of L.A. thinks it is fine, mostly peaceful. The Governor-- same thing. The minority leader of the U.S. Senate this morning: ``mostly peaceful.'' That is not what the people are seeing when they turn on their TVs or turn to the front page of the New York Times. So this rioting in Los Angeles is because President Trump has rightfully deported violent, illegal immigrant criminals. The L.A. Times, the local newspaper in the area, reported this week: ``L.A. officials struggle to curb `disgusting' vandalism.'' This is the L.A. Times. This is the New York Times. What are the Democrats not seeing that the rest of America is seeing? Theft, fire, violence indowntown L.A. The Los Angeles chief of police admitted his officers were overwhelmed. I guess he must be wrong and the Governor must be right, there in the Governor's mansion. How liberal can you get? Radically liberal. Dangerously liberal. It is scary how liberal they are. The police chief says violence has gotten out of control. Well, he is right. President Trump is right to bring in the National Guard. This is not to escalate; this is to end the destruction, the devastation that is happening in that community, to provide safety for citizens. They are there because Gavin Newsom, the Governor, and Mayor Karen Bass refuse to restore order. That is why they are there. Here you have it. The official stance of today's radical Democratic Party is to side with the illegal immigrants, the rioters, not the law- abiding American citizens. Let's talk about who the Democrats are protecting: murders, rapists, child abusers, drug dealers, gang members--the worst of the worst. That is who the Democrats are standing with day after day after day. Let me tell you about a few of these criminals. ICE officers arrested this past weekend a number of criminals in L.A.--an illegal immigrant of Vietnam who is convicted of murder; an illegal immigrant from Ecuador who is convicted of drug trafficking--welcomed in, of course, by the Biden administration and all the Democrats, who love these guys; an illegal immigrant from Honduras who was arrested for dealing drugs; an illegal immigrant from Mexico who was convicted of manslaughter-- that is who has come into the country and was arrested this weekend in L.A.; an illegal immigrant from Mexico convicted of molesting a child; an illegal immigrant from the Philippines convicted of rape. This is the list that the Democrats are vowing to protect. It is shameful. President Trump has taken all of these criminals off the streets. President Trump and Republicans are committed to public safety, committed to enforcing the law. It is the most important thing we do, and it is actually a pretty popular thing in this country today, and the polls prove it. Just this weekend, CBS started their show ``Face the Nation'' showing Americans feel safer today under President Trump's immigration policies--not by a slim margin, not by a few points--by 12 points. They feel safe by double digits because of what President Trump is doing. A strong majority of Americans are happy with President Trump's deportation policies and the way he is carrying them out. This poll was before the riots began in L.A., so let's take a look at what has happened since, because support for President Trump's policies has gotten even stronger since the riots began and the inaction by the mayor and the Governor of California, their refusal to take action. Just yesterday, an Insider Advantage poll found that a majority of Americans approve of President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard amid the riots in L.A., and it is by 20 points. This is a rock- solid call for law and order in America.  Look, Americans want safety, and they want security. American families deserve safe communities. For too many, like those in L.A., that safety feels out of reach--safety for their families--a kid playing out in the yard, going to school--safety in their communities, and safety at local businesses. Well, Republicans have a bold solution to change what is happening in these communities overrun by illegal immigrants, which has made every State a border State, and it starts with securing our borders and deporting illegal immigrant criminals. We have to pass this as quickly as possible. The American people are demanding it. Our budget bill we are working on invests $175 billion to stop the flood of illegal immigrants and illicit drugs into our communities. It hires 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. It hires 3,000 new Border Patrol agents. It provides bonuses to recruit, retain, and reward our brave ICE and Border Patrol agents. Our bill finishes the wall. All of these will deter illegal immigrants. Our bill surges new technology to the border. This is going to cut off the pipeline of illegal drugs and criminals before they even reach our communities. Our bill vastly expands our detention capacity. This will allow us to swiftly deport illegal criminals who threaten our safety. Republicans aren't stopping there. No, they are not. Our bill stops liberal States such as California from continuing to pay for healthcare with taxpayer dollars for 1.4 million illegal immigrants. These are illegal immigrants who are receiving Medicaid benefits. We need to stop paying for them to strengthen the Medicaid Program for those who need it, those who deserve it, those it was designed for. This bill is about delivering safe communities and a safe country for every American, and safe communities start with secure borders. Safer communities means families can live free from the constant fear of crime and from crime. Children can play in the streets, college students can go on runs on their campuses, and neighbors can open small businesses. Everyone can build a brighter future. This is a future worth fighting for, and Republicans have commonsense plans to make it a reality. So what have the Democrats done? They have come to the floor of the Senate and said: We are going to fight you all the way. They have vowed to fight us every step along the way as we try to provide a safer and prosperous America. Every one of them still supports open borders. The minority leader talks about this like, hey, things are fine; this is all peaceful. They have been singing that song for the last 4 years. What we have seen with the southern border of this country and the flood of illegal immigrants has absolutely been a disaster. With every State a border State, Democrats have learned nothing. They continue to be the party of crime and criminals. Republicans are focused on results, Mr. President, because we know that Americans want safe cities, not sanctuary cities. That is what the people voted for, that is what they demand, and that is what we are going to continue to deliver. We are not going to stop fighting at all because we are going to continue to fight to make America safer."
"I also congratulate the hon. Member for Blyth and Ashington (Ian Lavery) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Esther McVey) on securing this debate. A great strength of feeling about banks has been evident in this debate, and it is important to remember the importance of banks not just to our communities but to the wider economy. Banks provide services for businesses and individuals, but they also provide two other fundamental services. First, banks and building  societies take money from where it has accumulated and distribute it to where it is needed for investment in infrastructure, businesses and jobs. Secondly, banks take overnight deposits and turn them into 25-year mortgages--so that our constituents can create a home and build a family--which is quite difficult for banks to do. The hon. Member for Blyth and Ashington made a couple of important points that I would like to address. The first was about the profits that banks make, and the second was about the policing of banks and the fact that banks apparently police themselves. Following the 2008 financial crisis, there was obviously a huge number of problems in the banking system. The Financial Services Act 2012 created two regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, both of which--and particularly the PRA--are responsible for making sure that our banking system is sound. Banks need to have strong balance sheets, and to do that they need to make profits to a certain extent. I agree that some of those profits look obscene, and perhaps some banks could put some of that money back into our communities. None the less, if banks spend their money unwisely, we potentially run the risk of another banking crisis. Along with the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton South East (Pat McFadden), I am one of only two Members left in this House who sat on the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards from 2013 to 2015. Our work on that commission underlines the importance of banks in modern life, about which we have heard so much today. The commission found that holding and operating a bank account is now essential to participate in society and the economy, whether it is receiving wages, paying bills or accessing benefits. But we also found that people's views on banks are shaped by their direct experiences. The more a person knows their bank, the more likely they are to have confidence in it. That means that if banks want to retain their customers, they must provide good, wide-ranging services. An inability to access banking services risks eroding that trust and confidence, as we have heard today, especially among the most vulnerable."
"Mr. Speaker, I would recommend that everybody follow their local municipality's Facebook page. In my own riding, that is generally the best place to go. Either the band office will have its own Facebook page or each community will generally have its own Facebook page. That is generally the way to be the most up to date. Also, if anyone wants to do a two-way communication, the comments section underneath is often a good place to find that."
"I thank the Foreign Secretary for his statement and for his level-headed approach in calling for de-escalation. He has spoken about the threat of further escalation with the closure of the strait of Hormuz, through which--as he knows--a large proportion of the world's oil supply flows. Can he say more about how he will protect UK householders and businesses from a potential rise in oil prices?"
I move to proceed to legislative session.
"Absolutely. It is a very frightening situation for people to find themselves in. For carers who have to do all that I have described Richard having to do, having to battle their way to find the services available just adds to the problems. My constituent says that mental health services are the Cinderella of the NHS. There is a lack of staff and resources, and such services need more financial support so that they do not abandon people the minute they think they can get away with it. A number of Members have highlighted the importance of voluntary initiatives, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those in my constituency, including Time 4 Carers, the memory cafes in Yate and Thornbury, and the Charfield memory group. However, voluntary initiatives are not enough to provide the support that dementia patients and their carers need. The cross-party commission on social care is welcome, but unpaid carers such as my constituents cannot wait three years--they need a fair deal now. That means respite breaks, so that they do not get to breaking point and can carry on caring for their loved ones, as they want to. It means ongoing support from health services, regular check-ins and not being abandoned when the immediate crisis is over, and it means having the confidence that when they do need to turn to paid carers, those carers will be available, they will have dementia training, and cost will not be a barrier to using them."
"Mr. Speaker, once again, yesterday was a good day. Project Outsource was a big bust. It is why our government is committed to introducing new legislation that would toughen bail rules for serious offences and ensure sentences match the severity of crimes. We are working hard to make sure law enforcement has the tools it needs to investigate, to catch, to prosecute and to put criminals behind bars."
"Does the hon. Member agree that the problem begins even earlier? Nurseries receive no dedicated SEND funding, which means that essential early intervention is provided by schools and the funding is overstretched. That is neither sustainable nor fair for the children or for the schools trying to support them."
"I thank the right hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Graham Stuart) for securing this important debate. This issue affects families in Huddersfield and across the country. I recently met SEND parents from Huddersfield to hear their experiences of the system. They are trying to do the right thing, and to get the right support for their children, but too often the system works against them. They told me that the system is difficult to navigate, especially the process of gaining an EHCP and any subsequent appeals processes. I also heard from parents who were struggling to access home-to-education transport, or who were not able to get their children into school due to poor mental health or it being the incorrect educational settings. These stories are not one-offs. This is happening to too many families across the country, and it is clear that something has to change. I welcome the work of local support services, such as Kirklees Information, Advice and Support Service, which offers free and impartial advice, but it is dealing with a growing number of inquiries. In Huddersfield, we see growing demand for specialist support, but the funding is not keeping pace with that demand. Local services are stretched, schools are under pressure, and families are left to navigate a complex and often frustrating system. Last week, I visited the fantastic Southgate school, a specialist school for children with complex special educational needs. I spent time with its amazing pupils and teaching staff. The teaching and support staff are passionate about their work, but they spoke to me about the increasing complexities that they are dealing with, and their struggle to access all the emotional and mental health support that they need for their pupils. The transition to post-16 support is a particular issue. They also asked me to raise the need to look again at the pay scale for support staff, who are valued members of the team. The issue of pay is impacting retention. As the right hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness has said, there is a postcode lottery. Whether a child gets the help that they need often depends on local resources, not their actual needs. We need to take into account wider need, deprivation and the complexity of children's circumstances. I welcome the Government's recent moves to improve SEND provision. They include: injecting an additional PS1 billion into services; investing PS740 million in adapting classrooms and building specialist facilities; and restructuring the Department for Education to put SEND at its heart. Local authorities like Kirklees council need the tools and resources to respond properly to the challenges. Without a sustainable funding formula, local authorities will struggle to provide timely solutions. Schools want to do the right thing, as do councils, but they are often forced to make impossible choices, and that leaves families to pick up the pieces. We need a long-term plan that gives certainty to local areas and puts the voices of parents, carers and children at the heart of decision making."
"Under the previous Government, the number of PCSOs more than halved in Warwickshire. Indeed, in summer 2023, local teachers were forced to police a park in Warwick and Leamington after a knife gang terrorised pupils, stealing their bikes. More widely, constituents are fed up with crime and antisocial behaviour; 50% say that they have been personally impacted by crime in the past five years. Will the Home Secretary outline how the Government will address these crimes and make our streets safer for everyone?"
"Mr. Speaker, that makes absolutely no sense. Those who pay should get a rebate, not those who do not pay. It has been clearly established that this has nothing to do with a carbon tax he abolished—a move the OECD criticized—and we all know it was a vote-getting gift and an injustice, so will he acknowledge that the $3.7 billion Canadians received has nothing to do with climate change?"
"Let me start by highlighting my support for new clauses 85 and 86, which deal with neighbourhood policing. They would ensure that police forces are required to practise community policing ""at a level necessary to ensure effective community engagement and crime prevention"". It is a shame that the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Ben Obese-Jecty) is not in his place to intervene for a definition on that. It is about engaging with local communities and ward panels to define the appropriate levels in their areas--which I am sure he would support-- rather than taking a top-down view. The new clauses would compel the Secretary of State to produce an annual report on the state of community policing. We have outlined a way of funding that too: 20% of future police grants would be ringfenced for community policing activities, literally making crime pay--in the  reverse of the manner in which that phrase is normally used--by allocating funds recovered from the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to community policing. That is important, because commitments to policing numbers mean little without serious action to reverse the scale of forthcoming cuts, such as the cuts of 1,419 officers and staff that we in London are about to experience this year. Indeed, as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner recently told the BBC, ""ambition and money go alongside each other"". I urge Members across the House to support those new clauses. I will now turn to my new clauses 95 and 96. It is good to see the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Birmingham Yardley (Jess Phillips), in her place to continue a conversation that we have had many times on stalking. Stalking is a heinous crime: it throws lives into chaos, leaves victims in life-changing and near-constant terror, and too often goes unpunished. The current legislation forces too many victims to meet an improbably high bar of evidence, forcing them to jump through hoops to be a perfect victim, just to prove the scale of the threat against them. I have heard from victims in my Sutton and Cheam constituency who have had their lives completely upended by their stalkers, and who are completely at their wit's end after facing so many obstacles to getting justice. It is clear that the two relevant sections of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 are the root of those obstacles. The distinction between a lesser section 2A offence and a more severe section 4A offence is failing victims and fails to recognise the total scope of stalking. Successful prosecutions of section 4A offences are far too hard to achieve. The burden of proof is placed so heavily on the victim."
"I join Conservative Front Benchers in welcoming the answer to the urgent question, although maybe it should have been a statement. May I ask about autonomy and national sovereignty over the weapons system that will be deployed from this aircraft? There is considerable press reporting that it will be dual key, meaning that the Brits cannot use it without American say-so. Is that true? If so, why has the Ministry of Defence elected to take that option, rather than having full national sovereignty?"
"Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague on the quality of his French. There is a strong trend around the world right now. Will the future lead to electric vehicles or not? If we know that the trend is going in that direction, would it not be better for the Canadian economy to have policies in place that can support this transition?"
"Mr. Chair, is the government's target for 100% zero-emissions vehicle sales by 2035 mandatory or optional?"
"Mr. Speaker, the member is a very experienced member in presenting petitions, Mr. Speaker, and knows the rules. He knows that we should not be reading the entire petition but giving a quick summary of it. He is now on point four with respect to reading it. Hopefully you can encourage him to expedite the presentation."
"I thank my hon. Friend for his question. As I made clear in responding to the initial question, the inspector's report considers the application against published local, regional and national planning policy, which is likely to include consideration of a wide variety of material planning matters. In this case, that is likely to include safety and national security."
"Last week, I marked Loneliness Awareness Week by holding a reception for community groups looking at different ways to tackle loneliness. We heard from multiple groups, ranging from Oaklands health centre to the WizeKap team. Tackling loneliness in the UK is vital in improving the mental health of many and fostering stronger communities. Will the Leader of the House set out what the Government are doing to address loneliness in society?"
"Mr. Speaker, my colleague often speaks about her son, who is an example of exactly the kind of worker and skilled professional the country and, frankly, this government want to support. I was encouraged by conversations with labour leaders representing not only the skilled trades but a series of other professions that would benefit from exactly this kind of nation-building exercise. Provincial premiers speak to labour leaders about the importance of creating economic opportunity at a time when our economy is threatened, and we are doing this for people exactly like my colleague's son."
"I understand my hon. Friend's strength of feeling on Palestinian recognition. She will know we have always been clear that there is a role for recognition as part of a process, and we will continue to work with allies in the region and in Europe to bring about the process that will bring about recognition and the two states that we hold dear."
"My hon. Friend is right. I would also say that there needs to be a code of practice for our tenant farmers. Two of our amendments, which I will speak to shortly, seek to meet the challenges that our farming and agricultural communities face with CPO. I will elaborate on that later, and my hon. Friend is welcome to intervene on me then if he does not find my explanation satisfactory."
"Mr. Speaker, we have been clear in the House, as has the Prime Minister , that we will fight against these unjustified and illegal tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. We are going to protect our workers and our industry. The Minister of Industry already spoke about that over the weekend, and we are going to build a strong Canada. We are going to build the Canada of tomorrow, which is a confident Canada, a prosperous Canada, a Canada that we can all be proud of."
"Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise on behalf of the people of Kamloops—Thompson—Nicola. As always, I thank all members for their interventions, including this hon. member. The Liberals are talking a strong game about crime and things like that. I am wondering if my hon. colleague from the Bloc agrees with me that while the Liberals are talking a strong game, they have failed to take action on the issue of crime, and a lot of it has actually manifested itself in Quebec. I am wondering if the member agrees with me that this is a little hypocritical of the Liberals and that we should not necessarily take them at their word. They had ample opportunity to do this but have done absolutely nothing over the last 10 years."
"Mr. Speaker, while the federal government has made some major investments in wildfire mitigation, whether that is investing in early observation systems, training thousands of firefighters, or, in ridings like mine, investing in firebreaks through the disaster mitigation and adaptation fund, we know that with the increasing effects of climate change, we are going to see more wildfires like this. My question to the member here is—"
"The Secretary of State's message to the private sector is, ""If you want to build new nuclear, Britain is open."" Companies have told me that they need decisive and committed leadership from the UK Government to be confident to invest in a new project at Wylfa. I have raised that 11 times in the  Chamber, yet today there was no mention of Wylfa. Will the Secretary of State make it clear that the UK Government support the delivery of new nuclear projects at Wylfa?"
"I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for laying out how families lose and billionaires win on this not so beautiful bill that Trump has put forward. It is really a big beautiful betrayal, betrayal because Trump campaigned for helping families. But as we have seen with the details in the end, this is about helping billionaires. The bottom 20 percent, the less affluent, they get tax benefits of about $90 a year. Somebody who earns a million dollars gets $90,000 a year of tax benefit--$90,000 for an already, well-off, rich individual, and $90 for ordinary families struggling to get on its feet."
"The hon. Lady has asked an important question about the pharmaceutical industry, which is key to the country's growth mission and to supporting all our constituents and the entire country. As we know, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is currently attending the G7 summit. We have good relationships with America, and the Department is working closely across Government to ensure that the same stability of supply remains for our constituents."
"Oh, oh!"
"Twenty years ago, when first standing for election, I was told to limit my ambitions with regard to campaigning to bring the Metro to Washington, but I persisted and now, thanks to this Labour Government and the new Mayor of the North East, my ambition is going to be realised. Does the Chief Secretary to the Treasury agree that that is the difference that Labour in government can make and that what we are seeing is promise made and promise delivered?"
"My hon. Friend has rightly focused on the important questions that are at issue, such as how we can maintain the viability of a two-state solution. That is the only route to peaceful harmony, with two states side by side, and it is on that objective that our efforts are focused."
"My hon. Friend is right that the UK Carrier Strike Group is in Singapore and he is also right to draw attention to the very important India trade deal that was reached by the Government just a few weeks ago. In recent months, we have reached trade agreements with the US, with the European Union and with India. Many people thought that that could not be done over a course of years, but it was done over a course of weeks. Each one of those agreements will help to strengthen our economy and deepen our alliances with key allies."
"On a point of order, Mr Speaker. As the House will know, Laila Soueif stopped eating 247 days ago to try to save her son, the imprisoned British-Egyptian national, Alaa Abd el-Fattah. He is an Amnesty International prisoner of conscience who has been in jail for more than a decade because of his writings on democracy. Laila is now at risk of death. Have you had any indication of whether the Foreign Secretary will come to the House to inform us about what action the Government are taking to secure Alaa's urgent release?"
"After backing Teesside and Merseyside for carbon capture and storage last year, we are really pleased today to be able to announce tranche 2, with backing for both Acorn and Viking. We will crack on and get that investment to Aberdeenshire, as well as the investment that we are putting into Great British Energy. We know of the huge potential that Scotland has to contribute to those jobs and industries of the future in energy security, defence and so much more, and that is why we are backing Scotland with this spending review."
"Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to provide some clarity around a few of the measures included in Bill C-3 , an act to amend the Citizenship Act for 2025. Under the Citizenship Act, there are three ways to become a Canadian. First, people can immigrate to Canada to get Canadian status. This is the story of my parents. I am the proud daughter of Vietnamese immigrants. My family came to Canada with hopes of safety and opportunity for their children. Like countless newcomers, they worked hard to build a future with the promise of true belonging. They earned their Canadian citizenship the way many families have, through resilience, hope and a deep commitment to this country. Second, they can become a citizen by being born here. This is the story of my boys. Being Canadian, for me, meant that I did not have to pay a $100,000 hospital bill to have my children. My boys have inherited something that so many around the world dream of: Canadian citizenship. It matters to me as a mom and as a member of Parliament representing over 41,000 immigrants in my riding of Spadina—Harbourfront. We must continue to protect Canadian values while ensuring that the pathway to getting citizenship is transparent. Finally, someone can become a citizen by descent. This is where Bill C-3 steps in. It addresses the much-needed changes in Canada's approach to citizenship. In the previous act, Canadians who were born in Canada or who became citizens through immigration could pass citizenship on to children born abroad. However, those who inherited their citizenship by descent were not allowed to pass it on to their children born outside Canada. This rule, known as the first-generation limit, has created two tiers of Canadian citizenship. Bill C-3 would make two major changes to restore fairness and reflect our charter values. First, it would automatically restore or grant citizenship to individuals who lost it or were denied it due to outdated provisions, including the first-generation limit and the old rule that required people to apply to retain their citizenship by age 28. This includes lost Canadians, people who fell through the cracks of the law despite their deep connection to Canada through their parents and grandparents. They should never have been left out of our national fabric. They include the children of public servants posted abroad and people who lost their citizenship only because of technicalities. If enacted, this bill would extend automatic citizenship to anyone who was born outside the country to a Canadian parent before the legislation came into force and who is not currently able to claim citizenship by descent, because of the first-generation limit. Second, Bill C-3 would introduce a new framework for citizenship by descent beyond the first generation. Our proposed legislation would extend citizenship by descent beyond the first generation in a way that would be inclusive and uphold Canadian values. Any child born abroad when or after Bill C-3 comes into force, to a Canadian citizen who was also born outside Canada, would be Canadian from birth if their parent can demonstrate that they have a substantial connection to Canada in the form of three years of physical presence in the country before the child's birth. This strikes a fair balance. It would protect the integrity of Canadian citizenship while recognizing that many Canadians live, work and raise families abroad but remain deeply connected to the country they call home. What about now? What about families who cannot wait? If enacted, once in force, the bill would extend automatic citizenship to anyone who was born outside the country to a Canadian parent before the legislation came into force. This would include those who are currently not able to claim citizenship by descent, because of the first-generation limit. This would also include lost Canadians and their descendants. We know we cannot predict the number of children who would be born abroad when or after Bill C-3 is enacted. The current Citizenship Act will remain in force until this coming November. As Bill C-3 makes its way through the parliamentary process and the first-generation limit continues to be in force, IRCC has introduced an interim measure so that people impacted by the first-generation limit would have a pathway to citizenship. These are important steps while we work to enshrine these rights into law. What happens if this bill is not enacted? After November 20, if Bill C-3 is not in force, there would be no limit to citizenship by descent for many people born to Canadians abroad. Without this bill, Canadian citizenship for many could be passed in perpetuity to future generations born outside Canada, regardless of their connection to our country. However, others would remain restricted by the first-generation limit. There are several groups who would not become citizens or have access to citizenship as a result of the court declaration taking effect before Bill C-3 comes into force. I am proud to stand with a government that has put forward this bill and is finally getting this right, because being Canadian is more than a legal status; it is a promise. It is a promise of belonging, of dignity and of equal opportunity. It is a promise that has shaped my own life and the lives of millions. To be Canadian means having access to our democratic institutions, to vote, to run for office and to contribute fully to public life. It means access to job opportunities, public services and, yes, a passport that opens doors around the world. More than that, citizenship is about identity; it is about saying that someone is one of us. When we arbitrarily deny that promise to people with deep, verifiable connections to Canada, we are not upholding the value of citizenship. Instead, we are undermining it. We cannot leave behind those who love this country, who are tied to it by family, service and sacrifice. These are Canadians, and it is time we recognize them as such. In a moment when our country is striving to build unity, Bill C-3 is a step in the right direction. It is a step towards closing historical gaps, recognizing families in their fullness and embracing all who carry Canada in their hearts, even if they were born outside our borders. This is how my parents built a life for my family. It is how I built a life for my children and how we can welcome home the lost Canadians. I am proud to be the member of Parliament for a riding that is a mosaic. Immigrants are the backbone of this country, and Spadina—Harbourfront is a place where dreams take shape every day. We hear multiple languages on the sidewalk. We see small business owners opening shops before sunrise. We feel the vibrancy of different cultures, faiths and histories woven together, not in spite of our difference, but because of them. Let us be a country that does not forget. Let us be a country that welcomes, recognizes and belongs to those who belong to it. Let us pass Bill C-3 ."
"Mr. Speaker, what actions will the minister take to promote LNG exports?"
"Yes. Already this year, we are rolling out PS300 million of support through our Get Britain Working plan and Connect to Work. That will rise to PS600 million next year and build to an additional PS1 billion. This is the biggest ever investment into employment support for sick and disabled people, because we believe work is the route out of poverty. We want to build dignity and a better life for those who can work, while protecting those who cannot."
"It being 10:21 p.m., pursuant to order made on Tuesday, May 27, it is my duty to end the proceedings. The debate in committee of the whole will continue on the next designated day. The committee will now rise, and I will now leave the chair."
"Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Newmarket—Aurora . It is with deep humility and great pride that I rise in this chamber for the first time as the newly elected member of Parliament for Windsor West, a place I have lived in, served and raised my family in and now have the honour to represent right here in Ottawa. Windsor West is a riding with powerful identity shaped by immigration, industry, grit and community pride. We are a city of makers and movers. We do not just punch above our weight; we carry the ring. Before I go further, I want to begin with a few thank yous. I thank all of the volunteers who walked endless streets, made thousands of calls, hammered signs in the ground and occasionally fed the whole campaign team like it was a Punjabi wedding. I thank my beautiful wife, Michelle, who is the calm behind this storm. Her strength and endless belief in me kept me grounded. I thank my children, Aviana and Rohan, for their love, their patience and especially their hard work during the campaign. My campaign was powered by the people of Windsor-Essex, neighbours, friends and even strangers, who believed it was time for change. I thank those who stood with me through the campaign, people like Mahadev Puri, Jagjit Varraich, Harinder and Gurmehar Randhawa, Navdeep Bhogal, Tony Bajwa, Bina Taylor, John Elliott, Sam Nizzer and Tony Francis, and their loving families. I thank campaign managers Maurizio and Sukhdeep, our CFO Gurpreet, comms lead Al Teshuba, and our sign warriors Adrien Bezaire, Rob and Mary Soucie, Rob Cheshire, Pierre Lacasse, who likes to call himself Pierre for Pierre, Dino and Linda for showing up, rain or shine. Thanks also to to our office team, Patsy Copus, Guneet Baath and Elton Robinson, and to our community supporters: Manvinder Deol, Don Miller, Surjeet Gill, Sukhjot Singh, Harvinder Sran, Anil Sharma, Harmail Gill, Harry Sidhu, Mr. Chandi, Mr. Chohan, Mukhtiar Singh, Asim, Rafat, Arvind and Raminder, Dr. Aleem of the Ahmadiyya community, Rahul from the BAPS community, Panditji of the Windsor Hindu temple, Rohitbhai, Dhavalbhai, Mr. Grewal, Mr. Virk and the many members of the Christian, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh diaspora communities of Windsor. With their amazing energy, belief and action, they showed me what community in motion really looks like. Like many Canadians, my journey began far from here. I was born in Gujarat, India, and raised by my late parents, Didar Singh Gill and Surinder Kaur Gill, who instilled in me the values of hard work, service and sacrifice. Those values were further shaped by my teachers at Rosary High School and MS University in Baroda. My uncles Hargurdev and Kultar Singh Randhawa and my aunt Satwant Kaur Randhawa, who immigrated to Canada in the late 1960s and 1970s, sponsored me. Their families did not just open their hearts and their doors; they opened my future. When I landed in Canada in 1988 and came to Windsor, it felt like home. The people, the grit and the values all clicked. I am especially grateful to friends like Shawn Hand, Peter Ste. Marie, Viktor Burany and many others who welcomed me and helped me adapt. I went to study at St. Clair College and the University of Windsor and then served 29 years as a police officer in Toronto and LaSalle. Frontline service teaches two things: how to solve problems and how to spot people who are just pretending to. On the front lines of public safety, I witnessed this country's challenges but also its best traits: resilience, compassion and, yes, even some dark humour during tough moments. Windsor has always punched above its weight. It has been a transportation and manufacturing powerhouse central to Canada's auto sector. When Windsor succeeds, so does Canada. Over 9,000 trucks cross the Windsor-Detroit border daily, carrying more than $600 million in goods. A full third of our trade with the U.S. flows through Windsor. We are the beating heart of North America's just-in-time supply chain. For us, infrastructure is not an abstract; it is essential. That is why the Gordie Howe international bridge matters. Initiated under Prime Minister Harper and the previous Conservative government, it was a vision of nation building, yet the Liberals took three extra years to break ground. Had they acted with urgency, the bridge would likely be up and running today, cutting congestion, boosting trade and fuelling economic growth. We are also home to a major piece of Canada's EV future. A critical piece of the national EV supply chain is being built in our region, a project whose full potential will depend on delivery, not just announcements. Let us be clear: This battery plant is not a political trophy; it is a strategic necessity for Canada's future and competitiveness. Our auto workers, engineers and suppliers will make it succeed, but they need infrastructure, skilled labour and long-term planning to match that ambition. That starts with Ottawa finally treating Windsor not like an afterthought, but like the economic linchpin it is. The people of Windsor are hard-working and hopeful, but they are feeling the squeeze. Food bank usage is at record highs. Shoplifting is up not just due to gangs, but because people are trying to get basic items like food, diapers and toothpaste. Rents are out of reach. Grocery bills are growing. I had to respond to calls at grocery stores where loss prevention officers had seniors in custody for shoplifting food. Those seniors told me they were stretching one meal into three and did not have the money to buy food. Small business owners are wondering if next month will be their last month in business. This is not just a cost of living crisis; this is a crisis of dignity. Let me be clear. It is not the people who have failed. It is policies brought forth by the Liberal government that have failed. This week, the Prime Minister introduced his first major spending bill, the 2025-26 main estimates. After taking over a bloated government, Prime Minister Carney promised to spend less. Instead, he has increased spending by 8%, nearly three times the combined rate of inflation and population growth. Worse still, there is no budget. The government is asking Parliament to approve over half a trillion dollars in spending without a budget. It is the first time in over 60 years outside of COVID. If single moms, seniors and small businesses have to budget before they spend, a banker must do the same. The Prime Minister said he had a plan, but this is not planning; it is reckless spending. We have a phrase in policing: fail to plan, plan to fail. Let us not forget that Parliament voted just a week ago to demand a full budget this spring. The Liberal government has ignored the will of the House. This bill defies not just math; it defies democracy. To my colleagues in the Liberal government, I say this respectfully. Get to work for regular Canadians. Be bold. Do not just talk about a hinge moment. Turn the handle. Open the door. If plans are not working, take ours. Canadians do not care who gets the credit. They want results. We believe in policies that reflect lived experiences, whether it is fixing gaps in public safety or reforming taxes that will hit working families the hardest. If members want to know what matters to Windsorites most, all they have to do is tune into AM 800 for Mike and Meg, catch Ms. Maluske on the evening news or listen to Mayor Dilkens or any of the many independent journalists on social media. Windsorites want affordability, they want accountability, they want results and, more than anything else, they want to be heard. Windsor is a tough city. We have weathered border uncertainty, plant closures and more than a few broken promises from politicians, yet we always rise. We have union workers and entrepreneurs, new Canadians and fourth-generation families, and skilled tradespeople and students all trying to make it and make it matter, because they give a damn about their city and their country. To me, being Canadian means working hard, believing in fairness, helping a neighbour, saying sorry when someone else bumps into us and standing up for what is right, even when it is difficult. This House, as we know, is the beating heart of our democracy. I am here to serve with respect, humility and dignity. I thank the people of Windsor West for sending me up here. They welcomed a young man from distant shores, gave him the opportunity to serve and protect, and now have given him a seat in Parliament. I will honour their trust. I look forward to working with every member in this Parliament."
"In my Sherwood Forest constituency, high streets are the beating heart of towns such as Ollerton and Hucknall. Ollerton is set to receive record funding from this Labour Government, and I thank the Minister for that. However, Hucknall was badly let down by the previous Government, with false promises of funding that quite simply did not exist. Will he meet me to discuss how this Labour Government can support the future of Hucknall, enabling it to be the glorious high street it once was?"
The hon. member for Repentigny.
"It is National Diabetes Week, and as someone living with type 1, as we both are, Mr Speaker, I am more than aware of the serious complications of diabetic ketoacidosis--DKA--which can prove fatal if not caught early enough. A quarter of children are diagnosed with  type 1 diabetes when in DKA, and that could be avoided with early diagnosis. Will the Prime Minister commit to rolling out a national universal screening programme, as seen in Italy, for type 1?"
"I am concerned by the Government's kneejerk reaction in proscribing Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation. This country has a long history of protest, as I mentioned in the Chamber last week; some of the protests have taken place at British military sites, and none of those protesters have been branded terrorists. Last Friday, Palestine Action spray-painted two aircraft at Brize Norton--the first time that the group had taken action on British military land. Yes, they were guilty of criminal damage, but not of terrorism. Even the former Justice Secretary Lord Falconer said that this action would not justify proscription. If there is evidence, show it. Can the Minister set out what steps his Department will take to ensure that peaceful protest activity is not wrongly categorised as a national security threat?"
The hon. member.
"Mr. Chair, my question was whether we should be relying on the United States for purchases that could be made from other countries that are not currently hostile to our economic success as a nation."
"Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague is right that Bill C-5 is not a fix; it is how to get Liberal insiders on a select list of projects that will get done. This is ethically challenging, and it opens up a litany of opportunities in which insiders are going to get rich, once again, because of the Liberal government. It will pick winners and losers, versus letting the market decide. To the example that you raised on Bill C-69 and on ways to save it, we do need regulations and we need protections, but what we do not need is what we currently have, with which nothing is getting done. We are in a crisis in Canada, and the Liberals do not have the answers, because they are the ones who actually messed up this country so badly."
"Mr. Speaker, last week my hometown of Vancouver hosted North America's first Web Summit, an event that highlighted Canada's vibrant tech sector and its potential on the global stage. This conference brought together leading innovators and investors from around the world, underscoring the significant opportunities for growth in our AI ecosystem. Will the Minister of Artificial Intelligence share with the House how the government plans to solidify Canada's position as a global leader in tech and attract more investment and talent to our country?"
"Mr. Speaker, it has been four years since we were promised new selenium regulations to protect Canada's water and fish from the devastating impacts of coal mining. With the Conservatives and the Liberals in a bromance on Bill C-5 , I am wondering whether the minister will be bringing these protections forward. Now that they have decided to ignore workers' rights, environmental laws and indigenous rights, these protections and regulations are more important than ever. When will we see these long-awaited, long-promised regulations to stop foreign coal companies from destroying our beloved Rocky Mountains?"
"Mr. Chair, we look forward to buying those back from individuals. We are expecting about 180,000 units in total."
Will my hon. Friend give way on that point?
"The statutory override to special educational needs and disabilities deficit comes to an end in just 10 months. Without a plan from the Government for the end of the statutory override, more than half of all local education authorities face effective bankruptcy. The need for a resolution to the issue is now long overdue. When does the Minister expect to be able to give local authorities the certainty they need?"
I ask unanimous consent and my friend from South Dakota for 3 additional minutes.
"A consultation on Rosebank and Jackdaw is concluding, and the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero will report on it in due course. There is also the North sea transition consultation,  which has concluded, as I mentioned earlier, and which will take into account all those issues. It will be published in due course."
"My hon. Friend is a real champion for children and young people in her constituency. She is absolutely right to set out the differences in the cost of living that this policy will make for parents; as she suggests, it will also have real benefits in behaviour, attendance and attainment, as I set out in my statement."
"Madam Chair, the member for Mirabel has enough experience to know that the minister is playing for time. Can the minister tell us whether the cheques were sent out before the tax was collected?"
"Mr. Speaker, Canada is proud to be a leader in respecting environmental standards. We know we can undertake major projects, important projects, that create jobs and opportunities, without sacrificing our environmental values or our processes. Clearly, we need to take action, economic action. We need to speed up the process and stop settling for processes that are too slow. We need to speed things up to make room for opportunities."
I would remind the member to ask his questions through the Chair. The right hon. Prime Minister.
"on May 31, 2025, Ms. Teri Gage retired from her position as Superintendent of the Pullman National Historical Park. Today, I include in the Record the following Proclamation to recognize and honor her accomplishments and contributions to Chicago's first National Park.  WHEREAS, Teri Gage began her long career with the National Park Service in 1986 and worked at eight additional National Parks across the United States;       WHEREAS, she was notably enthusiastic, forward-thinking, and creative regarding her many managerial and budgetary responsibilities, working with the National Park Service, state and local officials, community organizers, and park visitors; WHEREAS, she emphasized the growth of her colleagues to find increasingly new and illuminating narratives to describe Pullman's long, complicated, and important history to enhance the visitor experience at the Pullman National Park; WHEREAS, she worked closely with the Historic Pullman Foundation, the National A. Philip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum, railroads officials, railroad buffs, industrialists, labor groups, architectural enthusiasts, historical organizations and other prominent local community organizations; WHEREAS, as the face of Pullman National Park, she facilitated innovative storytelling, exhibits, and ideas drawn from her colleagues, park visitors, and community stakeholders to preserve the many stories of Pullman, including its role in creating America's Labor Day holiday; WHEREAS, she launched a project to bring historically significant railcars back to the Pullman National Historical Park; WHEREAS, her inspiring contributions to Chicago's first National Park assisted in its continued ability to serve visitors with valuable information to conncct them with the history of an integral Chicago industry: railroads; WHEREAS, her colleagues have noted that while National Parks are one of America's best ideas, hiring Teri Gage as a superintendent of Pullman was another of those great ideas; WHEREAS, even in retirement, she will continue to serve as the official philanthropic partner and share her talents to preserve the Pullman story and encourage visitors to imagine themselves as an active part of that story; WHEREAS, her many contributions, leadership skills, and true passion for the Pullman National Park will continue to impact and serve the National Parks for generations of visitors, employees, and community members to come; and NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA that the remarkable work and service of Teri Gage to the National Park Service be recognized and celebrated on the occasion of her retirement."
"Mr. Chair, I am the Minister of Environment. I do not think I need to speak to the member about where I have travelled, but more to that space, if she has questions about the oil sands, she can ask the Minister of Energy ."
"My hon. Friend is absolutely right. On a constitutional basis alone, amendment (a) to amendment 77 is necessary, and I hope that hon. Members will feel they can support it. Moving on to factors beyond the constitution, I am concerned that there is a dangerous absence of an adequate regulatory framework for lethal drugs under the Bill. At present, clause 25 gives the Secretary of State powers to approve lethal drugs, while clause 34 mandates the Secretary of State to make provision for prescribing, dispensing, transportation, storage, handling, disposal and record keeping, as well as enforcement and civil penalties. However, the fundamental issue of how these approved substances are actually approved remains alarmingly weak. The Bill defines ""approved substances"" simply as ""a drug or other substance specified"" by the Secretary of State in regulations. There is no explicit requirement for those substances to undergo specific, rigorous testing for their use in assisted dying. When this issue was debated in Committee, I was disappointed to see good-faith amendments to engage, such as amendment 443, being dismissed."
"Madam Speaker, this is the way Canadian democracy works. We get voted into this House of Commons. Canadians have once again said they want a minority government, but the Liberals are acting as though they have a majority. The reality is that the Liberals need to work with us. They need to work with the opposition in order to get things done. They expect co-operation from us. We expect co-operation from them. What is the big deal in presenting a budget, as every government does every year? Why is the government not doing it?"
"Mr. Chair, if the government intends to resolve the situation, that means we can expect the $9 million to be refunded to SMEs in Quebec and the $11 million to be refunded to SMEs in Canada. However, can we also expect the return of the much-touted subsidy for zero-emission vehicles in general, beyond the money that was owed?"
"My constituent Phill is one of the 916 people in the special category mechanism who were suddenly and inexplicably excluded from the Government's infected blood compensation scheme when it was published in February  this year, even though the Government's expert group had said in August last year that they should be compensated. Why did the criteria informing the eligibility for the scheme change without explanation, and can the Minister please provide a list of all the conditions included in the core award?"
"I am very grateful to my right hon. Friend, the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for her question. It goes to the heart of where the UK should be at this time, and that is at the centre of the diplomatic effort. a diplomatic effort will be necessary at the end of this process because, sadly, once people have the ability to enrich uranium to 60%, that knowledge is not lost. It is the stepping stone to an advanced weapon, and therefore only a diplomatic solution and the correct framework can ensure that we keep the global community safe."
"Mr. Speaker, “a grasshopper gay sang the summer away, and found herself poor by the winter's first roar.” Since the election, the government has been dreaming of a bill on major projects of national significance, as reported in Le Devoir. Meanwhile, one thing nobody has mentioned since the election is that President Trump is doubling tariffs on aluminum and steel, threatening tens of thousands of jobs. What is the government going to do?"
"I thank the hon. Lady for her question, and she is absolutely right to draw attention to the continuing need to speed up compensation to sub-postmasters. Since we came into government, we have increased fourfold the amount of compensation paid to sub-postmasters, but there is an awful lot more to do. On the issues that Sir Alan Bates raised, the hon. Lady will know that under the group litigation order scheme, through which his compensation issues are being addressed, there are various independent points on the journey at which to consider the offer--"
"The Secretary of State tells us that this week's U-turn will cost PS2,500 million a year by 2029. Will she tell the House how she proposes to cover that expense?"
What steps her Department is taking to support female offenders
"Mr. Speaker, the answer is $49 billion. How much did the government forecast to spend on interest in the year's estimates last year?"
"Of course. We discussed this topic at great length in Committee, and many good amendments were tabled. However, as I understand it and as I think the hon. Lady agrees, having reflected consistently the Minister has not strengthened the environmental protections or the measures to deal with flooding risks to housing that will be built in future. In fact, I would argue that those protections have been weakened. I hope the Minister will go away and look at these issues again. Turning to environmental protections, we in the Conservative party say that they are under threat. The creation of environmental delivery plans sounds suitably wishy-washy, but this new centralised model turns bespoke ecological assessments into a bureaucratic chequebook exercise. While developers may cheer the ability to pay into a nature restoration fund instead of taking direct responsibility for mitigations, we should ask whether this is really restoration, or whether it is greenwashing. On Natural England, I remind the Minister once again that the Bill Committee held a huge evidence session. He consistently said that he had confidence in Natural England's ability to undertake the responsibilities he is seeking to impose on it, but time and time again he has outlined that he has allocated what I would argue is  a mediocre sum of money to Natural England. He is asking that organisation to make decisions and improve environmental protections for people across this country, but he still has not outlined what funding model will be in place. The chief executive of Natural England herself stated, in very generic terms, that she was not entirely sure that she or her organisation would be able to undertake those operations going forward. The Minister should listen to the huge concerns across this House that Natural England is not the right organisation to undertake those responsibilities--rather, it should be local councils and local mayors. They should be the ones who represent their constituents and speak for local people, and who can make the changes they need on environmental protections. The Conservative party has tabled two amendments that I hope--rather fruitlessly, I suspect--the Minister will look kindly on. He did not look favourably on many Opposition amendments in Committee; he says that he has strengthened the Bill, but that is just through Labour amendments. However, I hope that he will look seriously at new clauses 39 and 43, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (David Simmonds). New clause 39 would prohibit solar power developments on high-quality agricultural land. That is a vital safeguard for the future of British farming and national food security. At a time when global food supply chains are increasingly fragile, it is essential that we protect our most productive agricultural land from irreversible development. This clause will ensure that the UK's best farmland is preserved for growing food, which is what it is intended for, rather than being covered in solar panels. The clause does not oppose renewable energy; rather, it calls for a smarter, more balanced approach that directs solar projects to brownfield sites, rooftops, and lower-grade land, so that we do not undermine our capacity to feed ourselves."
Will the Leader of the House give us the forthcoming business?
"We want to see a civil service that delivers for the public. The reforms that we are pushing through include greater adoption of technology; relocating civil service jobs around the country, as we have discussed; and, critically, a focus on outcomes in key public service areas, not just the processes that lead to them."
"I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton Itchen (Darren Paffey) and I praise Nessa for her tireless campaigning. As a former teacher who taught swimming in my NQT--newly qualified teacher--year, as a mum of three young men who are all confident swimmers, and as the MP for Portsmouth's coastal community where water is a part of daily life, I know just how vital water safety education is. Every child should not only learn how to swim, but understand how to stay safe around water. As has been said today, warn and inform. That is why I welcome Labour's continued commitment to the PE and sport premium, with PS320 million for 2025-26, which schools can use for teacher training and to top-up swimming lessons. Labour's new Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill will mean that all state-funded schools, including academies, will be required to deliver the national curriculum, which will include swimming and water safety. In addition, the interim report from Labour's curriculum assessment review recognises the urgent need to rebalance priorities, especially in PE for our older pupils. However, if we are to teach children to swim, we need to ensure we have access to facilities--affordable facilities--in which to have lessons. I am pleased that Hilsea Lido is having a revamp for local use, but we need to help schools work with local facilities, be they private or council, to ensure that pools and transport are a real option and are really affordable. I also want to echo the praise for, and the promotion of, the Royal Life Saving Society for the work it is doing to help to educate us. Its resources are brilliant and there is no need to reinvent the wheel. I have seen the great work of my local National Independent Lifeboat Association. Alongside Portsmouth RNLI lifeboat and lifeguards, Portsmouth Southsea Voluntary Lifeguards and our local police and fire services, they all go the extra mile. Raising awareness helps inform and warn, but it needs to be put into practice to save lives. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham and Beckton (James Asser) noted, I also remember the childhood public service broadcasts some 40 years ago. They do work, and it would be a great and positive use of our online media platforms. In Portsmouth North, where children live near the sea, ponds, shorelines and marshes, these reforms to water safety education and swimming are not optional, but essential. I fully support the Government's steps to ensure that every child leaves school with essential lifesaving water skills. I fully support the extra calls from my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton Itchen. I pledge to work with him and others on behalf of our constituents to make a national strategy for water safety a reality for our kids and for all our communities."
I refer the House to my declaration in the Register of Members' Financial Interests. Litigation finance plays a key role in the legal system in the UK and provides opportunities for postmasters and others to take cases to court. The Civil Justice Council has just published its report on the sector. When will the Government respond to that report?
"Mr. Chair, we are getting there. We are reducing our immigration targets. We have Bill C-2 in front of us to deal with the large surge of asylums—"
"As someone who was diagnosed myself with an earlier stage melanoma, I really commend the work of my hon. Friend's constituent. I never used sunbeds and I spent holidays in my youth in Ireland, so I never saw much sun either--sorry to the Irish tourism board. As my hon. Friend says, it is an overwhelmingly preventable cancer, including by using sunscreen, better clothing, shading and no sunbeds. It is up to event organisers to provide sunscreen at events, but my hon. Friend is right. I want to personally thank Melanoma Focus for the support it gave me during my diagnosis. There are great charities out there to support people. I am sure a Minister will be in contact with my hon. Friend and her constituent soon to highlight the prevention aspects of this disease."
"Mr. Speaker, under the government's watch, the housing crisis has reached an unprecedented precipice, and no number of recycled ministers will hide the fact that the Liberal government is responsible. The CMHC's own numbers have declared the death of housing affordability across this nation, and the government's solution was to appoint a minister who as mayor of Vancouver was responsible for one of the worst housing and affordability epidemics we have ever seen. Will they simply stop talking about the housing crisis that exploded under their watch and actually do something about it?"
"No matter how the Minister tries to dress it up, the Chancellor made a monumental political mistake last year. While I welcome the news that the payment is being reinstated, it is cold comfort to those pensioners who missed out last year and faced really difficult choices over the winter. Will the Minister look at this issue again and reinstate the winter fuel payment for all those who missed out?"
"Mr. Chair, does the minister think that we should reduce immigration to Canada? If so, does she think that should happen soon? If so, by how much should we cut immigration? I would like the minister to give me a number."
"I rise today to honor two incredible Minnesotans and friends who were taken from us too soon: Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman. We lost Melissa and Mark two weekends ago in an unthinkable, politically motivated attack that also threatened the lives of State Senator John Hoffman; his wife, Yvette; and their daughter, Hope. Like many Minnesotans, I have struggled to come to terms with this tragedy and to make sense of it, but I found comfort in community and in sharing stories of my friends, Melissa and Mark. Today, I will remember the Hortmans for the people that they were and the legacy that they will leave behind. Anyone who knew Melissa and Mark knew that, together, they were a force for good. Melissa was a dedicated public servant, and both she and her husband devoted their lives to improving the lives of Minnesotans. Personally, Melissa and I shared a love of golden retrievers. We often exchanged stories and photos of our beloveds. She adored her golden retriever, Gilbert, and he adored her. Professionally, I had the privilege of working with Melissa over the years and watching her excel as speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives. I had always admired her work and her ability to work across the aisle and make tough decisions when she needed to. She was a true leader, and she led by example. Recently, Melissa had to take a tough vote that she personally didn't agree with, but it was the best deal that she could get. In my last conversation with her, I told her that I was proud of her. I was proud of her leadership. Standing here today, I am so glad that I did.  It is still difficult to comprehend the violent attacks on the Hortmans and Hoffmans, but what I do know is that we got here, in part, because of our divisive rhetoric that we have allowed to seep into our politics and into our communities. It will take our entire community coming together. We must hold ourselves and each other accountable. It is the only way forward, and it is how we honor the legacy of Melissa and Mark."
"Mr. Speaker, I want to go back to the Conservatives' 100-day plan. This is something Pierre Poilievre talked about in the last election. Nowhere did he give any sort of commitment to a budget. Many people watching this debate might detect a bit of hypocrisy. Pierre Poilievre is now saying that we should have a budget, when he himself was not prepared to have it brought in within the first 100 days. What we have is a Prime Minister who has been very proactive on the issue of affordability, and that is demonstrated in Bill C-4 . Will the member support Bill C-4 and recommend to her caucus that we pass it before the end of June so Canadians will get that tax break come July 1?"
"I cannot even look you in the eye, Madam Deputy Speaker, because I know I should not be tempted into quite that level of analysis. Very practically, we are  trying to deal with the fallout of Brexit. The hon. Member will have heard me say that we need a salvage operation, because of the consequences seen and the damage done as a result of the way that our leaving the European Union was conducted. I see this Bill as part of that salvage operation. We used to be part of writing such regulations with our colleagues in Europe, which we do not do any more, but we need a process to maintain them because of the reality of the supply chains, of how we do business and of where divergence has hit small businesses--and it is small businesses, in every single constituency, that have paid the price for this version of Brexit."
"Mr. Speaker, there is a housing crisis in Canada. We agree on that. Too many Canadians are seeing their dream of owning their own home drift further and further out of reach. Families are struggling with the rising cost, and young people are being priced out of the housing market. Communities across the country are being squeezed by a housing system that is simply not working as it should. I thank my colleague for that long list of current market prices. However, as we promised during the election campaign, and as the measures put forward so far by our new government show, we are going to tackle the housing crisis head-on with focus, determination and innovation. We are taking action to make housing more affordable for all Canadians. We have eliminated the GST for first-time homebuyers on homes up to $1 million and reduced the GST on homes up to $1.5 million. I thank my opposition colleagues for voting with us on that matter. We are also cutting taxes for the middle class, saving two-income families up to $840 a year. This will help those looking to save up for their first home. Once again, I thank my colleagues for voting with us on that. We are not just talking about change; we are delivering it. We are using every tool at our disposal to build homes at a scale and speed not seen in decades, and we are doing so by working in partnership with provinces, territories, indigenous communities, municipalities, and the private and non-profit sectors. Earlier today, I met with an organization that is working on building modular homes. Over the past few weeks, people have been referring to shipping containers. Our colleagues across the aisle are referring to modular homes as shipping containers. Maybe that was 50 years ago. This is not the reality anymore. The “build Canada homes” initiative is a pillar of our plan. It will transform the way homes are built in our country. It will accelerate the construction of affordable homes by streamlining construction timelines, leveraging public land and reducing financial barriers. This initiative will help nearly double the rate of housing construction, but it will also support investments in modular and prefabricated construction to develop a modern, sustainable housing industry built on Canadian innovation, Canadian businesses, Canadian workers and Canadian materials. We are not stopping there. We are working with provinces, territories and municipalities to cut development charges in half for all multi-unit buildings. In addition, the housing accelerator fund is helping us remove barriers to development, build tens of thousands of homes across the country and increase our housing supply. We are building a unified Canadian economy, and we are committed to making housing more affordable and more accessible for all Canadians. That is the promise we made, and we have a plan to deliver on that promise and build Canada strong."
"I beg to move, That this House agrees with Lords amendment 1."
"National security and security is a valid planning consideration, so does the Minister accept that, in the event that the Secretary of State allows this decision to go ahead,  regardless of the planning inspector's recommendation, this Government will essentially be putting our relationship with China ahead of our security relationship with the United States?"
"I respect the Minister very much, and I know that he cares deeply about people who rely on the social security system. That is why it is such a tragedy that he is presiding over these profound reforms without having consulted disabled people. Can he explain why so many benefit claimants feel that these reforms have been rushed through, not to make a fairer system but because the Treasury demanded cuts to meet the fiscal emergency created by the Chancellor's job-destroying, growth-stopping Budget? They are right to think that, are they not?"
"what is it that the Democrats don't want the American people to know? It is a legitimate consideration that the citizenry from sea to shining sea should ask themselves right now. What exactly is the problem? They say again and again, oh, DHS could do this if they wanted to. They already report to us. We are saying exactly that: The special interest alien data should be reported to Congress along with the rest of the data. Why would the Democrats take a big stand? This is the former chairman of Homeland Security and current ranking member, who has been on the committee for a long time. This is a rare appearance on the House floor to push back against about this. Americans should think about this. Democrats are pushing back on this because they don't want the citizens of America to know what special interest aliens, who participated in suspicious travel patterns, came into our country illegally in 2021, '22, '23, and '24. Because you know how many are coming in in 2025? Zero are coming in. That is how many. That is because we have an executive branch that has been enforcing American law since January 20 of 2025. We, the people, demand to know what is the data of so-called special interest aliens. These are suspicious-travel-pattern, illegal immigrants coming into our country. We want to know: Where did they come from? How did they get here? Where were they before? We want to know all the data that we allegedly collected. Congress has a right to know. Why would DHS need Congress to codify their authority to give us this data? It is because of activist radical judges that stop the executive branch. Every day Americans have to read about that garbage, a radical judge stopping the elected President from performing his role as Commander in Chief and President of the United States.  The executive branch needs Members of Congress to perform like my friend and colleague, Ms. Marjorie Taylor Greene, has done by presenting this law. I am a proud original cosponsor. The President needs this legislation to mitigate against the radical judges that will try to stop him from releasing through Congress to the American people the data from 2021, '22, '23, and '24 of what suspected illegal aliens came into our country that fit this category. Now, across the country and in this body, most Americans know I am very plugged into law enforcement. I get calls every day from these guys, boots on the ground across the country, including deep in Federal law enforcement, and they support this law. Don't tell me that Federal law enforcement doesn't want to do this or it is bad for the country in some way. That is smoke. That is smoke that is being put out by Democrats to protect themselves from the impact of the reveal of the truth of just what kind of people that fit this category were allowed into our country. They were waved in for 4 years. It was stopped almost immediately in January of this year. I am clearly in full support of the bill. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the bill. We are going to bring this bill to the floor, and they are going to call for a recorded vote. I am glad they will. I hope you do call for a recorded vote because I want you on the record pushing a red button. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it also."
"Mr. Chair, the numbers are already available. I also spoke with my colleague—"
"People in my constituency are worried. They are worried by the constant stream of applications for new battery energy storage systems in and around the villages across the constituency--from Kinver to Swindon, Hinksford, Wombourne, Lower Penn and the edge of Kingswinford. Their worries were not exactly alleviated by the response the Prime Minister gave to my question last month. He did not give the impression that the Government understand residents' concerns and some of the reasons for those concerns. Lower Penn in South Staffordshire is a lovely village with a population of just under 1,000, and it felt like pretty much all of them were in the village hall for the public meeting in February. At least seven battery sites have been either approved or proposed in or close to that small village. The same is happening in villages across South Staffordshire. As I have been sitting in the Chamber for this debate, I have received another email from the planning authority inviting me to speak on one these applications, which are coming through at such a rate. That reflects the position across the country. There are 121 operational battery energy storage systems in the United Kingdom, but over 1,500 more are in the pipeline, so we really are at a tipping point, but the planning and regulatory systems have not yet caught up. That is why we need action. As has been said, such batteries have a low failure rate, but sometimes they go wrong, just as they do in mobile phones and electric vehicles. That is why airlines tell us we cannot charge our mobile phone battery while we are on a flight, and it is why Parliament has decided that electric vehicles cannot be charged in the underground car park. It is not because the risk is high; it is because the consequences of things going wrong can be catastrophic. Whereas a mobile phone may have a capacity of 15 to 18 watt hours and an electric vehicle battery perhaps 80 to 100 kW hours, the site in Tilbury--the site of the fire earlier this year, which I think the hon. Member for Horsham (John Milne) referred to--when completed will have a capacity of about 600 MW hours. To put it another way, that site will be the equivalent of 33 million iPhone batteries. As we see an increase in these sites, we know from basic statistics that there will be more fires on top of those we have already had this year in Tilbury, Cirencester and Aberdeenshire. We therefore need to ensure that our systems are properly adapted and modernised to reflect those risks. The risk of a fire is not only about the potential danger to human life--for both those who may be nearby and the firefighters who are sent to bring those fires under control over what may be 24 or 48 hours --but about our local natural environments."
"we can deliver meaningful results. We need to put programs in place that will help our citizens, save lives, and keep our communities safe."
"Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleague to read the Liberal platform. We have made major commitments with respect to transforming government operations. We got to work as soon as we returned. The “build Canada homes” initiative will help make it easier to get housing built faster. That is what Canadians need now."
The hon. member.
"I echo the comments of my hon. Friends about how open and engaging both the Minister and the Secretary of State have been on this issue. As for the consideration of working groups, can the Minister confirm that the Government's policy is to ensure that both sides are in the room at the same time, with the Minister and the Secretary of State? This has been rehearsed before; the last Government failed, and talks broke down. May I urge this Government please to ensure that both voices hear each other? Their job is to manage that process, as well as leading it."
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for Burnaby Central for his dedication. Canada's support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's illegal and unjustified war remains steadfast. Earlier today at the G7 summit, the Prime Minister announced $2 billion in new military support to aid Ukraine in its time of need. This includes funding for drones, for ammunition and for armoured vehicles. We are also providing over $2.3 billion to help Ukraine rebuild its infrastructure and its public systems. Make no mistake: Canada will stand with Ukraine until victory."
"Mr. Chair, I have been here since 2019. We have been hearing for many years about a grand program to plant two billion trees. I have yet to see those two billion trees. It seems to me that there were discussions between Quebec City and Ottawa about using the two billion tree program to carry out silviculture in Quebec. Is this a solution that the minister would be willing to consider?"
"Mr. Chair, it is time to build."
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge today's scathing Auditor General's report on the current and future use of office space. The report noted that the Liberals promised to reduce office space by 50%, with $1.1 billion over 10 years to do so. However, the Auditor General found that the office space reduction will only be 33%. The results show the absolute failure of the Liberals to get housing built. After years of flashy announcements, all they have are endless broken promises. The report says that it takes six to eight years to dispose of surplus buildings, a completely unacceptable and costly timeline. As millions of Canadians are struggling to find affordable housing, this latest report confirms just how out of touch and unhelpful the same old Liberal government has been."
"Rolls-Royce Submarines in Derby, just outside my constituency, is a major employer of my constituents. Will the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster confirm that the Government remain committed to the nuclear triple lock and comment on how today's announcement will support our nuclear manufacturing industry in the east midlands?"
"Mr. Chair, we are committed to a continued dialogue with the bargaining agents on the issue."
"Mr. Chair, can the minister tell me how much federal debt needs to be refinanced over the next five years?"
"Mr. Speaker, in 1955, a 22-year-old Italian man from Treviso, Italy, got on a boat and took that courageous trip across the Atlantic Ocean to Canada. He ended up settling in Woodbridge, Ontario. When he arrived, he worked at a mushroom farm, then a steel factory, and then he started a business. He lived the Canadian dream. That man was my grandfather Nico Guglielmin, who passed away last year at the beautiful age of 95. My grandfather truly was the inspiration in my life. He was strong and strict, full of decency and integrity, and he was also kind and understanding. He never lost his temper. No one ever saw him sweat. He was accomplished and qualified. They say we can judge a person by what people say about them when they are gone. I say that Nico Guglielmin was a great man. He was a risk-taker who achieved his dreams, an entrepreneur of incredible accomplishment and a gentleman who carried himself throughout his life with dignity and honour. I wish a happy Italian Heritage Month to the residents of Vaughan—Woodbridge and all Italian Canadians, like my grandfather Nico."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, up until now, on each of these bills, I have been speaking fast, but I know that Mr. Rose and Ms. Waters are planning to get here in just the next few minutes to speak on the next two bills. Since they are not here yet, it does the House no harm for me to speak more slowly and perhaps at greater length. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1190, the Expanding Access to Capital for Rural Job Creators Act, sponsored by my colleague, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Downing). I will point out that I am uniquely unqualified to address this bill since my entire district is in an urban area, that of the great city of Los Angeles. Yet, even I recognize the importance of getting capital to our small businesses in rural areas. I strongly support this legislation, which would require the SEC's Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation to report on capital access issues faced by small, rural businesses. Currently, the SEC small business advocate reports on small businesses that are minority owned or women owned or in disaster- stricken areas. Yet, at present, the law does not report on businesses in rural areas. The bill simply adds rural businesses to the list covered by the entities of the small business advocate and the entities that the small business advocate will report on. Small businesses, no matter where they are located or who they are owned by, are the backbone of the American economy. Helping small businesses should be about as nonpartisan as we can get here in Congress. Lawmakers and regulators should be doing everything they can to support them. Those businesses located in rural areas face unique challenges. We have had other speakers on other bills talk about how so many of our financial institutions and business investors are focused on the East Coast or the West Coast or in New York, Silicon Valley, or some of the other large cities in our country. It is important, therefore, that the small business advocate also reports on the needs of rural small businesses that are seeking to raise capital. Lawmakers and regulators should be focused on those businesses. This is common sense, and I hope my colleagues will support it. I commend the gentleman from Montana for bringing this bill to the floor, and I look forward to continuing to discuss this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"Mr. Chair, I do not think the member really has been here throughout the whole proceedings. Estimates were tabled. We have our levels planned. We have the numbers of the different categories of people who are being brought in. We have met those—"
"Goodness me, the Deputy Prime Minister has a cheek. Housing starts in quarter four last year went down--her mission to rebuild Britain is not going very well. She talks about asylum hotels, but she obviously has not looked at the most recent numbers. The number of people in asylum hotels was higher in March this year than it was at the time of the election. And she gave no answer about the priority being given to illegal immigrants over people already living here. A Zimbabwean paedophile due for deportation was recently allowed to stay in the UK because a court found that he might face ""some hostility"" back in Zimbabwe, which apparently breached his article 3 rights. What about the rights of children here to be protected from this dangerous paedophile? Who is looking out for their rights? Not the Government. There are thousands of such cases involving foreign criminals. There is a solution: we need to scrap the Human Rights Act for immigration matters so that this sovereign Parliament decides on the law that our courts apply. But the Deputy Prime Minister's party voted against that. I have a simple question: why do the Government side with foreign criminals and not the British public?"
"the corrupt Georgian Dream party continues to wrongfully arrest opposition leaders of the Republic of Georgia. As the Georgian Dream schemes a one-party state, gives the Chinese Communist Party their Black Sea port, and blocks America from trade, the Georgian people have conducted over 200 days of consecutive protests for freedom. Americans stand with the legitimate President Salome Zourabichvili and the Georgian people. The MEGOBARI Act for freedom, sovereignty, and rule of law received 90 percent of the vote in the House. Joining the proposed Trump Tower in Damascus, Syria, should be the Trump National Golf Course in Tbilisi, Georgia. In conclusion, God bless our troops as the global war on terrorism continues. Trump is defending American families with peace through strength, revealing war criminal Putin's lies, insulting Trump and mocking Trump, and hosting Iranian murderers in Moscow."
"I want to thank my colleague from Iowa very much, Mr. Chairman, for your acknowledging the horrific terrorist attack in Boulder yesterday. I will be out here later with my colleague Senator Hickenlooper to talk about it at greater length. People were there week after week after week to mark the horrendous hostage taking that has occurred in Gaza and that Hamas has refused to address--hostages only Hamas can release. This war could end tomorrow if Hamas released the hostages. People all over this country and all over the world have marched in solidarity for our hostages. Yesterday, the people in Boulder, CO, were savagely attacked by a terrorist while they were expressing their First Amendment rights. That should never happen in this country. Again, I thank the chairman, my colleague, and my friend from Iowa for coming to the floor to discuss that today. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
"Mr. Chair, as the minister was told before, jobs will be risked in all these sectors by Bill C-50 . Since 2.7 million of those jobs are at risk, will the minister just tell us how many Canadians have to lose their jobs for him to consider the just transition, phasing out oil and gas in Canada, a success?"

"Mr. Speaker, the reality is that inflationary spending causes our dollar to weaken because the government floods the economy with excess borrowed money and it weakens our dollar, raising the cost of everything."
"Indeed, huge numbers of people were hit so hard during the pandemic. We agree that although support was broad, it certainly was not perfect. On top of the suffering, the pandemic widened existing inequalities and divisions in our nation. Those who could not earn enough--the low paid, the young and people outside London--were hit the hardest. They were already turning away from us in this House; they are now turning away more quickly. We can bring them back only if we act to ensure that every single person can earn enough for a decent life, if we create a nation in which we recognise that our strength is founded in each of us doing well--a nation of unity, common purpose and connection. It is for us to build that nation, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham and Beckton rightly noted."
"I rise today to honor a giant--not just in Cougar Country, not just in American athletics, but in the world of track and field. His name is John Chaplin. Born in Los Angeles, educated at WSU, an Army veteran, a professor in geography, and a coach in the truest, oldest, most honorable sense of the word. From 1968 to 1994, Chaplin transformed WSU from a modest program into a global track and field powerhouse. Under his leadership, the Cougars captured 19 Top-4 NCAA trophies, won 218 All-American honors, and crowned 17 individual NCAA champions. His dual-meet record--202 wins to just 15 losses. Nine undefeated seasons. Six national dual meet titles. He coached Olympic gold medalists, world record holders, and world champions--and he did it not in Los Angeles or Austin, but in Pullman, Washington, on the rolling hills of the Palouse. Chaplin's recruits came from Spokane, Seattle and from all corners of the globe--young men chasing opportunity, education, and excellence. Henry Rono, Julius Korir, Bernard Lagat--these weren't just track stars. They were ambassadors of what college sports can be: meritocratic, international, and transformational. But Chaplin was more than a coach. He was a statesman of the sport. He served as U.S. Olympic Head Coach in Sydney in 2000, where his athletes won six gold medals. He chaired the USA Track & Field Men's Committee, refereed NCAA and international championships, advised federations from Russia to Senegal, and lectured on coaching from Argentina to China. He brought honor to his profession and to Washington State. Mr. Speaker, I must tell you this: The very program he built is being hollowed out. Just last week, WSU announced the elimination of field events and a dramatic reduction in sprints and hurdles. Of the forty- five Cougar Olympians, twenty of them came in field events. The legacy of Chaplin, and the athletes he coached, is being boxed in by a system that no longer rewards broad-based opportunity. Yes, these cuts come in the shadow of the House v. NCAA settlement. A legal sledgehammer that forces schools like WSU into an unsustainable economic model that drains the lifeblood from Olympic sports. Chaplin's world record holders? His All-Americans? In today's system, they're expendable. We can fix this. We must. Not with more lawsuits, not with blank checks for the Power Four--but with federal reform that restores equity, sustains opportunity, and honors the values that John Chaplin stood for. If we lose the spirit of Cougar Track, we're not just losing a program. We're losing a piece of what college sports was meant to be."
"Given the points that the right hon. Gentleman makes, there are two things that I am surprised he has not welcomed. The first is the historic increase in defence spending that this Government have already put made, with an extra PS5 billion in our first year in government alone; he will remember that when his party came into power in 2010, it cut defence spending by PS2 billion in a year. We also have a commitment and plan to increase spending to 2.5% in two years' time and to 3% in the next Parliament, which is an ambition that I am confident we will fulfil. He is right to say that if we are to meet the challenges of the SDR, and the challenges of reinforcing our industrial base and our armed forces, we cannot do it alone. We are not doing it alone; we are one of 32 nations in NATO. The second thing that I am  surprised he has not welcomed is our security and defence partnership agreement with the European Union, which is potentially a first step to working with other European nations in the EU, and using financing that may be available in Europe to do exactly as he urges."

"I rise today to recognize the outstanding contributions that Tommy Baker has made through his work with NAMI Hernando. Tommy works as the Operations Manager of Meares Plumbing and Electrical and former Board President of NAMI Hernando. He has been a pillar of leadership and unwavering support for mental health in our community. Tommy's impact reaches far beyond boardroom decisions. Tommy brings integrity, dedication, and a true sense of responsibility to every aspect of his volunteer work. As Board President, Tommy played a pivotal role in strengthening NAMI Hernando's foundation, guiding strategic growth, and supporting long-term sustainability. His leadership helped expand outreach efforts and foster new collaborations that increased access to mental health education and support. Tommy's commitment to advocacy inspired the creation of the annual Strike Out Stigma fundraiser, an event that continues to unite the community in support of mental wellness. Building on its success, he spearheaded the launch of Reconstructing Hope--a nonprofit initiative that brought together businesses in the construction industry to raise funds for multiple localnonprofits, including NAMI Hernando. He has consistently gone above and beyond--whether offering professional expertise, mobilizing support through Meares Plumbing, or showing up as a visible advocate for mental health awareness. His quiet leadership, humility, and spirit of service have made a lastIng impression on all who work with him. It is clear Tommy Baker has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility."
"I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham and Beckton (James Asser) on securing this debate. It may be five years since the pandemic began, but those years cast a long shadow. Regrettably, the effects will be felt for many years to come. Across my constituency in and around Bolton, the pandemic left a deep scar, with thousands of lives tragically cut short. Those were not numbers on a board or figures on a screen; they were neighbours, parents, siblings, children, mums and dads, aunts and uncles, family friends and loved ones. Their memory must be honoured, not just with fine words in the Chamber today, but in our commitment to learning the lessons from the covid pandemic, so that never again do we find ourselves wholly unprepared for a public health emergency. We would be doing all those people who lost or risked their life a huge disservice if we did not learn the lessons of the pandemic, so I implore the Minister--I hope we will make progress on this--to look at how it was possible that our frontline workers were sent into battle against the virus without adequate personal protective equipment. There was PPE that was deemed unfit for purpose, PPE that was not delivered in a timely manner, and PPE that was not manufactured to NHS requirements. PPE contracts awarded by the previous Government meant that millions of pounds of taxpayers' money were squandered through a cavalier approach to procurement, and serious questions were raised about integrity, probity, and value for money. Five years after covid first hit these shores, these issues continue to wind their way through our courts. Of course the Government needed to act at speed--nobody denies that--but what went on is, in my view, inexcusable. Leading anti-corruption charity Transparency International UK produced a 2024 report, ""Behind the Mask"", which found a total of 135 high-risk covid-19 contracts, totalling PS15.3 billion. Many of those were awarded without competitive tender, and were rushed."

"Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Winnipeg North was talking about the number six; I am sure he was talking about Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre's record when he was a minister of housing and only six houses were built. In my constituency, even a small builder builds more than six houses a year. My question is for the hon. member. He talked about the $4-billion accelerator fund. Is it important that some of the Conservative members were also asking for that money?"
"Mr. Speaker, the main issue during the election campaign was a serious crisis, a tariff and trade crisis. The day after the election campaign, poof, it disappeared. The Prime Minister went to Washington to meet with President Trump and came back with nothing to show for it. That said, the Prime Minister has since made significant concessions on tariffs, borders and defence. He said that all of the tariff issues would be resolved before the G7, but he is returning empty-handed yet again. Should workers be satisfied with a 30-day deadline?"
"I thank my hon. Friend for giving way, as well as for her excellent chairing of the Health Select Committee at the moment and for opening today's debate. Does she agree that this Government's record investment in our health service will be vital to turning around the health service after 14 years of under-investment and a lack of reform? As my hon. Friend has touched on, that investment also needs to be targeted to enable the three shifts that the 10-year plan talks about. In particular, we need to reverse the trend of more spending going towards secondary care while less goes to primary care. We need a big uplift in dentistry, which my hon. Friend has mentioned, but also in primary care--in GPs--and in pharmacy."
It is compliant with the non-proliferation treaty. The NATO nuclear mission has as a governance the NATO nuclear planning group of 31 allies--everybody gets a say--so it is not a question of it being Donald Trump or any other US President's nuclear bomb. This is a NATO mission to defend Europe and to do what NATO was set up to do: deter another war.

"I warmly welcome the expansion of the free school meals entitlement. It is an evidence-based approach for which many of us have campaigned for a long time. It will help to close the disadvantage gap in our schools, tackling child poverty, benefiting children's health and supporting children to learn. I hope the Government will agree that every child who is eligible for this expanded entitlement should be able to receive that entitlement. Whether or not children get a free school meal to which they are entitled should not depend on somebody else making an application for them through a complicated process. The Government know which families are in receipt of universal credit, so is the Minister considering auto-enrolment for this expanded entitlement? That would be easier to achieve than auto-enrolment under the previous entitlement, and every child really should be able to benefit. Can I seek the Minister's assurance that this very positive announcement is not an indication that other measures to reduce child poverty, such as scrapping the two-child cap, have been taken off the table? Finally, as a London MP and a former Southwark councillor who was very proud to be part of a council that introduced universal free school meals in 2010--we have seen the benefit of that policy, and I am proud we have a Mayor who is funding universal free school meals for all primary schoolchildren in London--can I ask for confirmation that London will also receive the funding for this expanded entitlement, so it can be put to the benefit of further reducing child poverty in London?"
"A third of children in Bishop Auckland live in poverty, so I welcome today's spending review, which set out how they will benefit not just from the free breakfast clubs, but from the extension to free school meals, warmer homes, more access to sports and the arts, and their parents getting the pay rises that they deserve under this Labour  Government. But many of those children live in deprived neighbourhoods, which have seen big cuts to social infrastructure over the past 15 years, including the closure of swimming pools, youth clubs, Sure Start centres, boxing gyms and the like. I noted with interest that, on page 36, there was a reference to 350 deprived communities across the UK receiving Government investment. Will the Chancellor say more about that, because there are no figures in the spending review. If she cannot give a full answer today, perhaps I could engage with her office on this later."
"I strongly welcome the Prime Minister's announcement on defence spending, especially during Armed Forces Week. Does he agree that this is a landmark, historic commitment, reflecting both the scale of the threats that we face and this Labour Government's commitment to the security and defence of our country?"
What steps he is taking to ensure that nature-friendly farming funding schemes are accessible
"On that point, will the hon. Gentleman give way?"
"It is great to see this Bill come to the Commons. I applaud its desire to improve the quality and availability of bus services. Buses are at the core of our public transport system and are often wrongly neglected in favour of what some--although definitely not me--would describe as sexier and more alluring methods of transport, such as trams and trains. As we have heard, there is much that is good in the Bill--particularly the empowerment of local authorities to operate their own services and the provisions to implement services for socially necessary routes--but it could do more to address the needs of rural areas, including through VAT exemptions for small public transport vehicles to encourage demand-responsive and community transport schemes. It could do more to help local authorities to transition to net zero vehicles. As has been said, we should look again at restoring the PS3 bus fare cap to a PS2 cap. In Oxfordshire, the county council feels that its bus partnerships with operators are delivering improvements, particularly when it comes to Oxford Bus Company and Thames Travel, which serve my Oxfordshire constituency of Didcot and Wantage. Franchising has the potential to bring further improvements, although it is good that the Government have acknowledged that we do not necessarily need a one-size-fits-all approach. Franchising will be viable only if local authorities are given long-term funding certainty and support to acquire the expertise and capacity in their passenger transport teams. We Liberal Democrats consider access to primary healthcare facilities to be socially necessary routes. In my constituency, the decision was made in the past few years to change the route of a bus going through the village of Harwell and into Didcot town centre. The change meant that people who live in Harwell can no longer catch one bus to the GP surgery in Didcot, despite it being only 2 miles away. That is the sort of thing we need to consider. Much about the current bus provision in my constituency is good. The integrated rail and bus terminal at Didcot Parkway enables a convenient interchange. There are decent bus frequencies and journey times during the daytime between Didcot and Wantage, Grove, Oxford and Wallingford, and between Wallingford and Oxford. There are good examples of partnership working between the major employment centres at Harwell campus and Milton Park and the Oxford Bus Company and Thames Travel. For example, Milton Park's PS20-a-year bus pass offer for people who work there is leading to measurable achievements in encouraging modal shift. There is generally decent daytime village provision. But there is also much that needs to improve. Many villages have no evening or Sunday service, particularly Stanford in the Vale, which has seen significant housing growth. The buses that serve Culham campus, which the Government have proposed as an AI growth zone, are meagre, with no evening or Sunday service. In the evening, service frequencies drop on all routes, meaning that the integration between train and bus at Didcot  works less well. Reliability can also be patchy, particularly on routes that involve Oxford, although that is mostly due to road congestion. I am delighted to be a member of the Transport Committee. In April, we visited Ireland to understand the reasons for a significant increase in rural bus patronage, which increased fivefold between 2022 and 2024. That was achieved through increased public funding and by engaging communities--particularly the local equivalents of town and parish councils--in the design of routes. The core principle is, as a bare minimum, to have the restoration of morning, early afternoon and early evening services--there are also late evening services in many instances to address the issue that was mentioned earlier in respect of pubs--to create a viable alternative to driving. Ireland has set itself extremely ambitious targets to grow its public transport youth share, from 8% today to 19% in 2030. That would nearly match Swiss levels, which are the highest in Europe. To achieve that, Ireland is investing large amounts in high quality continuous bus corridor infrastructure in urban areas, particularly in Dublin, and there are longer-term plans for significant journey time reductions for inter-city train routes to improve integration between bus and rail. As well as all that, people told us that they are concerned about the social, environmental and economic objectives that they are trying to hit, rather than looking simply at the cost in isolation. There are good examples in the UK of the Ireland approach. I was on holiday in North Yorkshire in April, and North Yorkshire council had taken over a route abandoned by a private operator, using its own minibuses--route 11 between Clitheroe and Settle. It offers a two-hourly service, and connects well with hourly train services between Clitheroe and Manchester. Integration is critical to making public transport more accessible and attractive, as Switzerland has shown. For those reasons, the Government's integrated transport strategy is eagerly awaited, and will be an essential component in achieving better use of our public transport system, to the benefit of the economy, the environment, and reducing social exclusion. Although the Bill goes a long way towards improving bus services, there are a lot of things that the Liberal Democrats would like the Government to go further on, so that we can achieve our ambition for our transport system and ensure that it fulfils our social, economic and environmental needs."
I refer the right hon. Lady to my previous answer.
"I thank the Secretary of State for that answer. I have been working with disabled constituents, our local jobcentre and employers to ensure that everyone is working together to maximise opportunities for disabled people, and that they are not just recruited but retained and thriving in jobs locally. However, some people will never be able to work or return to work, including many people with advanced progressive multiple sclerosis, and it is right that they are properly supported. Will my right hon. Friend confirm what support will be in place for people like my constituents living with this disease?"
"At one of my surgeries, I heard from a civil servant who had gathered evidence for the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse across the whole of England. They described themselves as being ""left emotionally and physically drained"" after collecting evidence, only for the Government not to act on it. I welcome this Government's acceptance of the 12 Casey review findings, but will the Secretary of State assure my constituent and other civil servants that there will be no delay in implementing the findings of the IICSA?"
"I am grateful to the right hon. Member for bringing forward this debate. Waiting for more than three years to hear about the outcome must be absolute torture for those who served in Afghanistan and supported us. As the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Afghan women and girls, I am emailed by people waiting for resettlement through ARAP and the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme who want updates that I cannot give them. Does he agree that the Minister needs to review the communications given to outstanding applicants to ensure that they are given updates in a timely manner?"
"Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned many, many times, in eight years only 20,000 people applied. It is for people who have applied. Not everybody is going to apply. That is what we need to look at. We do not know what people's intentions are or what they plan on doing. We just know that for people who apply, it will be looked at case by case."
"Mr. Speaker, if the member has great ideas that he would like to share, I would welcome them. However, again, I will point out that the Minister of Canadian Identity is the one responsible, along with the Secretary of State for Nature , for biodiversity and land and water protections."
"I was incredibly fortunate to sit on the Bill Committee considering this legislation. It is clear that, although opinions differ on details, we all share a common goal of tackling crime in a meaningful way, so that we can make people feel safe in our communities again. As a community-focused liberal, I have stated many times that keeping people safe and instilling safety in our neighbourhoods are some of the most powerful ways that we can foster strong communities and improve the quality of life and freedom of opportunity that everyone in our country should enjoy. I am grateful to the Government for their willingness to engage with the points that we all made in Committee, particularly to the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Birmingham Yardley (Jess Phillips), and the Minister for Policing and Crime Prevention, the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North and Cottingham (Dame Diana Johnson). Despite several productive conversations, it is frustrating that several important additions to the Bill were rejected by the Government in Committee. For that reason, I rise to speak in favour of several new clauses before us. Although several of the measures closest to my heart--those regarding community policing,  knife crime and stalking--are not before the House today, there are several pressing new clauses that I feel I must speak to. They pertain to what should be fundamental rights in our country: the right to freedom from oppression, and the right of access to proper healthcare for women. I congratulate the hon. Member for North West Cambridgeshire (Sam Carling) on the courage he demonstrated in his speech earlier, and encourage the Government to consider the measures he spoke to if they come back from the Lords, if not to consider them beforehand. I start by expressing my support for amendment 19, which deals with spiking and was tabled by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight East (Joe Robertson). Spiking is a horrendous offence--a deeply violating act of harm and potential exploitation that must be treated with the utmost seriousness. In Committee, we heard evidence from Colin Mackie, who is the chair and co-founder of Spike Aware UK. Colin gave important evidence for the Committee to consider, indicating that spiking offences can often be intended as pranks, rather than intended to cause harm. His son Greg died in a suspected drink-spiking incident in a club, and Colin has since campaigned alongside Greg's mother Mandy for a change in the law to stop similar incidents from occurring. I also thank the hon. Member for Hitchin (Alistair Strathern) for raising broader concerns about spiking. I agree that further measures need to be introduced, including A&E awareness, so that testing takes place, further evidence can be gathered and a conviction can be secured. Amendment 19 is a sensible and necessary clarification of the law. It makes clear what seems painfully obvious: that what matters in spiking cases is not the nature of the intent, but the recklessness and callousness of the act itself. I encourage Members across the House to support the amendment when we vote. I am also pleased to support amendment 160, as well as related new clauses 92 and 93, which we will discuss tomorrow. Taken together, these amendments create vital safeguards around the right to protest; they would subject facial recognition technologies to the proper scrutiny of a regulatory framework for the first time, and would enshrine the right to protest. From many people in my constituency of Sutton and Cheam and from campaigning groups such as Liberty, I know that these measures are long overdue, and will provide much-needed clarity to police forces as they use new technologies to fight crime. Police forces themselves are asking for these measures, and I am looking forward to a briefing later this month from the Minister on that subject. In particular, I remind the House that Hongkongers in my community are deeply worried about the impact of unregulated use of facial recognition technology on our streets. They fear that, if compromised, such technology could provide a powerful tool to the Chinese Communist party in its transnational oppression of Hongkongers here on our streets in Britain. We know that facial recognition technology can be a powerful tool for police forces as they try to keep us safe, but as with any new technology with great capacity to infringe on our liberties in daily life, it must be properly regulated. Liberal Democrats have a proud tradition of standing up for those civil liberties, arguing that we must never throw them away or sleepwalk into surrendering them. Amendment 160, which the Liberal Democrats have tabled, is rightly in that tradition. It  would make sure that facial recognition technology cannot be used in real time for biometric identification unless certain conditions are satisfied, such as preventing or investigating serious crimes under the Serious Crime Act 2007 or public safety threats such as terrorist attacks, or searching for missing, vulnerable people. It would also make the use of such technology subject to judicial authorisation, with a judge needing to approve its use and appropriately define its scope, duration and purpose. These regulations would allow for safe use of this important tool, protecting our civil liberties while keeping us safe from crime."
"I welcome the U-turn on the winter fuel payment--of course I do, and lots of my constituents will do likewise--but there is no respite in this spending review for farmers in Scotland, business owners in Scotland, GP surgeries in Scotland, or the disabled in hospices in Scotland. Despite what the Chancellor says, there have also been real-terms cuts to the Home Office, Foreign Office and local government in this spending review. The Chancellor is an open book. She plays roulette with the economy, but I would not encourage her to play poker any time soon, because she mentioned Reform and the hon. Member for Clacton (Nigel Farage) in her  speech more times than she mentioned Scotland--what a disgrace! She mentioned that she has finally got around to Acorn, but without a figure attached. What funding is she going to allocate for Acorn? We know that if it is Merseyside or Teesside, there is PS22 billion for them. How much for Acorn?"
"Mr. Speaker, this gives me the opportunity to talk about how important farming is in this country. One in nine jobs is related to farming, and 6.75% of our GDP is related to farming. I have spoken to every first minister across the country, and one thing we have in common is that we are united in our front against these tariffs, and we will stay that way because it is going to benefit everybody."

I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).
"I thank my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham and Beckton (James Asser) for securing this debate. We have rightly spoken about those who died during the pandemic, but covid also did something else: it made it much harder for people to earn a decent living. Those who were already struggling--the low paid, the young and people in places outside London--suffered the most. First, covid hit low-paid people in jobs such as bartending, which could be done only in person because they required complex manual movements, while those in high-paid jobs could use Zoom to reach the office. The low paid were hit and far more likely to be laid off or placed on furlough. Secondly, the young fell behind while the wealthy baby boomers continued to pull ahead. In the two decades leading up to covid, house prices went up by 100% while wages grew by only 20%. That is why the young cannot afford homes. During the pandemic, quantitative easing, low interest rates and pensioners not spending cash meant that baby boomers started to buy homes again, and house prices are up 25% since covid began, while some 40% of 18 to 30-year-olds are living at home with mum and dad. Thirdly, London continues to pull ahead. Zooming to work enlarges London's effective size, while places outside the capital lose out. More and more people and economic activity are sucked into the capital. The people who already could not make ends meet are pulling away not only from mainstream parties but from this House itself. The economically insecure are 50% more likely to have stopped supporting the Labour party, but they are also leaving almost every party in this House. We can reshape our nation so that everyone can earn enough, but we will do it only if the Government act. For the low paid, we must invest to create good jobs and  to get bills down. For the young, we must build far more homes. For the rest of the nation, we must invest outside London. We are at this moment a nation deeply divided, and the pandemic widened those divisions."
"My hon. Friend is absolutely right. If we were to devolve the Crown Estate and introduce a new entity, that would risk market fragmentation, complicate existing processes, and delay further development offshore, jeopardising those jobs and that investment. Even if it could be done without risking the revenues, that would not automatically lead to more money for the Welsh Government, because any revenues they retained would likely be offset through reductions to the block grant, as is the case in Scotland. Meanwhile, Wales would no longer benefit from Crown Estate assets and profits in England."
"the debate and eventual voting on the Big Beautiful Bill has begun. Hallelujah. It has taken a while for us to get here, but we are going to have a debate worthy of a great country. We will have what they think and what we think, and we are going to vote on this bill in the coming days. I am excited about that. I have worked a long time with my colleagues to get to where we are today. So, to the American people, the debate is beginning right now regarding the Big Beautiful Bill. I will tell you why that is good news for you, but let me take a little bit of time to talk about current policy versus current law. I know everybody is on the edge of their seat at home, but here is what I would tell you about numbers and Budget chairmen. I am not the first Budget chairmen. There have been those who came before me. In 2008,Chairman Kent Conrad--a really nice guy from North Dakota--used a new baseline in the budget so he could get the farm bill in the budget. Judd Gregg--a really smart guy, a former Budget chairman--said:  The chairman of the Budget Committee declared the new baseline under a new budget. . . . The Budget chairman has a right to do that.  That is what I am doing. I am setting the numbers. The Parliamentarian said that is my job as Budget chairman. The resolution we are operating under to get us here--we voted to make that the case. So we are not doing anything sneaky. We actually voted to give me the authority to do this, and it passed. Again, I am not the first chairman to change a baseline for different reasons--one, to get the farm bill in, and on another occasion, Senator Sanders changed the baseline in 2022, when he was Budget chairman, under budget reconciliation to issue a budget rule allowing the numbers to change to get more money for Head Start. So Senator Sanders, as Budget chairman, directed that a new rule be written to get more money for Head Start.  So don't tell me you have never done this before in terms of changing the baseline as Budget chairman. The Budget chairman, under 312, sets the baseline. This has been acknowledged by Republicans and Democrats. The baseline has been changed in the past based on the Budget Committee chairman's desire, one, to get a farm bill in, and the other, to change the numbers--a new rule--to get Head Start spending. So this has been done before. But I will be the first to say that what we are doing here is historic in a good way. In 2017, we passed the Trump tax cuts. They are due to expire in December. Why is that? Before I got here, current law was the way to score or implement tax policy. After 10 years, the tax cuts expired-- current law. As Budget chairman, I have decided to use current policy when it comes to cutting taxes. If you use current policy, they never expire. So the policies that were created in 2017 would not end in December; they would continue. That is a good thing for the American people, and that is a good thing for the economy because it gives you certainty. So I made a decision as Budget chairman, working with my colleagues, to look at tax cuts as something important for the country, to give certainty to businesses and individuals, and make sure that after 10 years, they don't arbitrarily go away and have a cliff. I made that decision, my colleagues backed me up, and that is in the budget resolution governing the debate we are here for today. So why do we want to make the tax cuts permanent? Because if they expire in December, the average family of four in South Carolina will have a $1,700 increase. I don't want that, and I bet you people at home don't want that. So we have to deal with that. That cliff is coming, and not only do I want to avoid that cliff, I don't want to put us in that position ever again. The tax cuts have generated more revenue for the government than CBO estimated in 2017. The one thing about our friends at CBO--I appreciate all your hard work; you have worked really hard--when it comes to taxing, they always get it wrong about how much revenue is to be collected. When you look at the years that have passed since 2017, on the corporate side and on the individual side, the revenue to the government has actually grown because of those tax cuts, and that is a good thing. So cutting taxes means more money for you and your family. Our friends on the other side, if you are waiting on them to cut your taxes, you are going to die waiting. They are never going to do it. Why are we doing it? Because they won't do it. We could never get 60 votes for this. The bottom line is, we are going to make these tax cuts permanent. That is a good thing for businesses. Expensing will be allowed, so you can invest in growing your business. You can buy new equipment. You can write it off sooner. That will get more activity in the economy. It is not me saying that; there is a track record. Mr. President, you have been in business. This stuff works. They don't like it, but it works. If you are in business, and the Tax Code encourages you to invest in your business, you will. This stuff literally works, and they hate it because it is money that could have gone to the government but went back into the economy. What they don't realize is, actually, the government gets more money. They just keep spending it. We could do better on the spending side, and we are going to do better on the spending side. So this bill makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent. It avoids a tax increase for your family that is coming in December if we don't act now. It secures the border. One of the reasons there are more of us than our Democratic friends is how you screwed the country up for the last 4 years. We went from secure borders to completely open borders, absolute chaos. That is why we are winning, and you are losing. You want to take us back to open borders. We are not going. We are not going back to your policies that allowed 8.3 million encounters at the border, 1.7 million ``got-aways,'' and chaos in cities and communities. We are not going back to the policies that led to Laken Riley's murder in Georgia, where the man convicted of murdering her was captured several times, released because there was no detention space to hold him in Texas and he left--a free man--went to Georgia, and killed this lady. That has happened too many times, and it is going to stop. Now, what are we doing to secure the border? We went from lawless borders to the most secure borders in 6 months because of President Trump. President Trump, you should be exceedingly proud--Homan, the whole team. You have locked that border down. But we want to do it in a way that it will stay locked down for the President after you and beyond. So how do we secure the gains made by President Trump and his team? We are going to, in this bill, hire more ICE agents to expedite removal of people who shouldn't be here, particularly criminal elements, people who are dangerous. We are going to finish the wall. Not one Democrat-- maybe one--no way would we get 60 votes to hire more ICE agents. No way would we get Democratic help to finish the wall. We are going to go from 40,000 detention beds to 125,000. This securing the border is about $175 billion. New technology along the border and fiber cable so we don't go back to the days of open borders--this is in the bill. To those of you who voted for us and President Trump to secure the border, we are delivering through this bill. And they would never do what we are doing. I will be the first to admit, when it comes to securing the border, they are never going to do what we are doing. We are hiring more ICE agents; we are finishing the wall; and we are increasing more detention beds so we don't let people out that can go and murder. I am very proud of this. I wrote this part. This is money well spent. This will secure that border in perpetuity. President Trump, this is your bill. It is in our bill. Well done. To my friends on the other side, you had your chance, and you screwed it up big time. That is why we are in charge. Revitalized our military. The world is a dangerous place. We have $150 billion in this bill to help build out the Golden Dome, to help improve the quality of life of the men and women serving the military by improving their barracks and housing. They need the money--more weapons--to send this bill, and we didn't have to get extorted to buy a bunch of butter to get $150 billion. We reduced government spending over a decade by $1.6 trillion. We are running a deficit in our national debt of $37 trillion. So what have we done here? In the last 5 years, from 2020, basically, to now, Medicaid has grown by 50 percent. So what has happened is that Medicaid was originally intended for children and poor families--children--and people who were disabled and couldn't work to provide healthcare. Count me in for that. Makes lot of sense. Along comes President Obama. He expands Medicaid to include able- bodied adults for the first time. And what he did was he incentivized States to include these people in Medicaid. For every new able-bodied adult, you get 90 percent of the cost from the FederalGovernment, 10 percent from the States, and Medicaid has grown 50 percent. It is going to take over Medicare because of what President Obama did. So what are we going to do? We are going to try to deal with that in a responsible way. What about this idea: If you are not a child, if you are not disabled--if you are able-bodied and you don't have any children under 14--we are going to have a 20-hour-a-week work requirement for you to stay on Medicaid. That is a good thing. It is a good thing for the individual involved to be working. It is a good thing for the taxpayer for them to be working. But that seems to be a crime on the other side to ask somebody to work that can work. How many people out there listening to this--I don't know how many there are--but are you working every day? Are you going to work with kids? A lot of people do that, by the way. So one of the reforms in this bill is to introduce a work requirement to the additional population that President Obama put on Medicaid that was never intended under the original purpose of Medicaid. This work requirement is going to save a bunch of money. Finally, we are addressing the biggest scam I have seen in a very long time. Somewhere along the line, somebody figured out at the State level, if you tax doctors and hospitals and medical providers on the funds they get and take that revenue, you can actually get more Medicaid money. This is a money laundering scheme. It needs to come to an end as we know it. States have gone up to 6 percent of a provider tax. They take that tax revenue, and they use it to get more money from the Federal Government. The hospitals and doctors don't lose. They get the money back. The State doesn't lose. They get more money. The only group that loses is the Federal Government, and we are deep, deep in debt. So we are going to reform the provider tax system that I think is abusive--very abusive. As to Medicaid, it is on a growth trajectory that will overtake Medicare. Now is the time to put commonsense reform in place not only to slow the growth--and we are not talking about cutting Medicaid, we are slowing the growth--but try to create some sense of fiscal responsibility. So to our chairman of the Finance Committee, you have constructed a package better than 2017. You have included some growth elements in the package that will allow the economy to grow because it will be in business's interest to invest, and I want to applaud you for this growth package. Now what does this all mean? Current policy, current law. If you do what I have decided to do, make the tax cuts permanent and you implement these reforms to Medicaid in other areas, you will, over the next 10 years, reduce the deficit by $507 billion. That is CBO, not me. Now, how do you do that? You grow the economy, and you begin to control spending in a commonsense way. Most people can relate to that because they do it all the time. People at home sometimes have to work extra to meet the needs of their family, and they have to tighten their belt. So what have we achieved here in the One Big Beautiful Bill? We are going make your border as secure as it possibly can be and never go back to open borders. We are going to put in place border security measures to keep it secure. We are going to make the tax cuts permanent so your taxes do not go up in December of this year, and we are going to add additional pro-growth policies to help our economy. We are going to reform Medicaid in a way that makes sense, deal with the waste, fraud, and abuse of that program so that there is more money for the disabled and children because the more money you give the able- bodied who can work is less money for children and people on disability. And one of the most perverse things about what President Obama did is that the reimbursement rates to States are higher for able-bodied adults than they are for disabled people and children--90 percent. So President Obama created a system to entice States--lure them in--to add people to Medicaid that are not disabled, not poor children, because his goal was to put everybody in the country under government-run healthcare. And the government reimbursement is higher for an able- bodied person than it is for a poor child or a disabled person.  We are going to stop that because that is not fair. It is not fair to the taxpayer. It is not fair to the population that we are trying to help. So we are going to control spending in a commonsense way; we are going to revitalize our military at a time of great need; we are going to secure the border; and we are going to make the tax cuts that expire in December permanent so we don't have to deal with this every 10 years. It is a big beautiful bill if you believe in cutting people's taxes, securing the border, having a strong military, and controlling government spending. It is a nightmare--this bill--for those who want to raise taxes, who want open borders, who want a weak military, and never want to control one dime of Federal spending. This bill is your nightmare if you are for open borders. This bill is your nightmare if you want the government to grow without any limitation. This bill is your nightmare if you want a weak military because it is going to give us a stronger military. So why do we have this debate? That is what they--through years of effort--have done. The military is always the last thing that gets funded when they are in charge. When they are in charge, you have no border--completely broken, millions of people running through our country lawless. When they are in charge, there is no limit to growing the government. They entice everybody to grow the government. And when they are in charge, they are never going to cut your taxes in any meaningful way. The tax rates since 2017--the top rate has been 37. If these tax cuts expire, your taxes--if you are a family of four--will go up by $1,700, and we will go back to the 49.6 rate. Here is a question for the country: How much should the Federal Government take of anybody's income? What is a fair share? Thirty-seven percent seems pretty damn fair to me--over a third of what you make, and that doesn't count State and local taxes. The number they would pick is probably 90. So is 37 percent fair? I think yes. Most Americans think 25 percent is fair. You know, Jesus wants 10 percent. There is no number they won't embrace. So somewhere between 90 and 10--37 is fair. This is not rewarding the wealthy; it is creating a number that makes sense. Thirty-seven percent going to the Federal Government is a fair share. It is over a third of what you make. That doesn't count State and local taxes. This has been long. It is been hard, but we are about done. In a couple of days, we are going to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill. President Trump is going to sign it. Mike Crapo and his staff deserve at least one day off. I cannot thank you enough for what you and your team have done. To my budgeteers, you have been terrific. You have worked really hard. To CBO and Joint Tax and all these people, hats off to your efforts to get us a quality product. To all of my colleagues who have rode the boat with us, we are about to reach the shore. And when this boat comes ashore, every family in America can heave a sigh of relief. Your taxes will not go up this December. You will get a Christmas present of not having a tax increase. To those who have been yearning for a secure border, it will be secure. To those men and women in the uniform, you are going to get some help. You desperately need it. To those who think we should do something about the government's growth in a commonsense way, we have achieved that. I am very proud of this bill. I am very proud of President Trump. I am very proud of the Republican team that has gotten us to this point. To my Democratic colleagues, we will work together where we can, but nobody over here ever expects you to do anything about the border because you have proven you can't. Nobody over here believes you are ever going to reduce the size of government because you don't want to. The bottom line is, we are about to make history, Mr. President. This is your first term. I don't know what comes later for you. I hope you arehere for a long time if that is what you want to be. You are a great Senator. You are a good businessman. You made a real success story: family from Colombia, created a lot of job opportunities. I doubt if you will ever do anything more important than this. Senator Crapo, you have been here a while. You are one of the smartest guys I have ever met. Everything you have done in all your life has led to this moment. This is what you were built to do. This is what you were meant to do. You are the right man at the right time to do what this country desperately needs to stay on track to be safe and prosperous. To all my colleagues who are going to vote for this bill, you should be proud, and you should talk about it because it is going to make us all safer, and it is going to make us all more prosperous. My being Budget chairman is a quirk in the history of the Senate. This is not my thing normally, but I have really gotten into it. And I have learned a lot thanks to my colleagues, and I am proud to have the honor of being Budget chairman at a time I think it matters the most. Mr. President, with that, I yield to my good friend. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the use of calculators, whatever they are, be permitted on the floor of the Senate during consideration of the bill."
"today, I rise to recognize Captain Michelle Wiltrout, who retired this year from the Summit County Sheriff's Office, as this week's Champion of the Week for Ohio's 13th Congressional District. For 32 years, Captain Wiltrout, dedicated her career to serving and protecting the people of Summit County in a wide range of roles. Her work has spanned the corrections division, the patrol division and special operations, the detective bureau, and more. In 2021, Captain Wiltrout earned the Taskforce Director position for a State of Ohio Narcotics Taskforce, making her the first woman to run a Narcotics Taskforce in the State of Ohio. Just two years later, she was named 2023 Taskforce Commander of the Year for her exceptional work and dedication in her role. She was also the first woman to receive this honor in the State of Ohio. While in charge of the Drug Unit, Captain Wiltrout introduced new tools such as drone technology, and expanded the county's K9 unit from one dog to eight. Again, I want to thank Captain Michelle Wiltrout for her distinguished career serving our community, and congratulate her on being this week's Champion of the Week."
"Mr. Chair, through you to the hon. minister, what is his definition of affordable housing?"
"Madam Speaker, it is great to see you in the chair once again. I want to congratulate my colleague for getting elected for the first time. It is a pleasure to work with him. I am just curious to know what the member's thoughts are. We have heard a lot of soft talk from government members on how they want to build nation-building projects, yet we are not hearing about any specific projects. They met with the premiers, yet nothing concrete actually came out of it. It was just lots of words but no action. I am just wondering what the member heard at the doors about things that his constituents would like to see the government do and get done, versus just the fluffy words we have heard so far."
"I want to return briefly to the socially necessary services that the Secretary of State mentioned. Two issues in my constituency are of great importance: the first relates to the fact that school-only buses are often more expensive than regular services; and the second relates to operators, who tell me that the current SEND transport model is unsustainable and that children with special educational needs and disabilities are being left with a poorer service. Will the Bill seek to address those concerns?"
I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).
"My hon. Friend is right to celebrate the recent figures showing that the UK was the fastest-growing economy in the G7 in the first quarter of this year--a sign that this Government's focus on growth is beginning to bear fruit. We are determined to drive growth in every corner of the country. The lower Thames crossing, which my hon. Friend has long campaigned for and this Government have approved, will deliver big benefits in Dartford and beyond."
"The shadow Secretary of State has been called a bit later than the hon. Member for Hamble Valley (Paul Holmes), for whom I outlined the reasons we have not put an exact figure on that and confirmed that we will build the biggest increase in affordable and social housing in a generation. I say gently to the shadow Secretary of State that we are delivering for working people by banning no-fault evictions and  introducing groundbreaking protections for renters, which the Conservatives promised but did not deliver. We are introducing major planning reforms to build 1.5 million homes; they promised 1.6 million homes, but could not get anywhere. We are also delivering the largest ever single package of devolution measures, pushing power out of Westminster. We are delivering where the Conservatives failed."
"The hon. Member will be perfectly aware--as, indeed, everyone in the House will be--that questions about the winter fuel payment in Scotland are devolved to the Scottish Government. Decisions made in Scotland are the responsibility of the Scottish Government, but I am pleased to reiterate to the House what the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have said. This was a difficult decision, and now that we have a little more breathing space, we are very pleased to make changes to help more pensioners."
"Before I allow the minister to respond, I will note that the question must come through the Chair. I cannot respond, but the minister can provide an answer. The Minister of Indigenous Services."
"Mr. Speaker, the other aspect of the legislation is to eliminate the GST for first-time homebuyers, up to $1 million, on the purchase of a home. I wonder if the member could indicate whether the Bloc supports that. Also, just to reaffirm her position, does she personally support or does the Bloc support the tax break for Canadians?"
"Bishop Challoner school has been helping to educate Bromley pupils for nearly 75 years, but it will close its doors in July due to Labour's decision to impose VAT on independent schools. Given the Deputy Prime Minister's well-publicised views on independent schools, does she welcome this closure or would she like to apologise to the parents, pupils and staff?"
"Madam Speaker, I believe that the member opposite was around, at least in the hallways of Parliament, when Stephen Harper was prime minister. Harper was elected that February, and it took him months to introduce a budget, not until May. There was a new prime minister and a new government, and it took him months to prepare a budget. We have a new Prime Minister and a new government, and it is going to take time to actually come up with a budget that is going to be able to work in through the plan. I suggest to the member that the ways and means motion, which he voted in favour of just yesterday, has a great deal of detail with regard to how and where money is being spent. We cannot have it both ways or people would call us hypocrites."
"One of the consequences for my constituents of losing services like the 84/85, the T2 and the 622 is that they are cut off from health services. Does my hon. Friend agree that  such access should be a priority for investment, and that a focus on the increase in passenger numbers when judging investment choices disadvantages rural areas?"
I call the shadow Secretary of State.
"Mr. Chair, earlier, the minister was worried about whether truckers would be able to cross interprovincial borders. Personally, I am only going to worry about whether they can cross the St. Lawrence. Does the minister know where heavy traffic has to go to cross the river in Quebec City?"
"Mr. Chair, the question was, what are the debt-servicing costs?"
"Mr. Speaker, that is a very important question. At the G7, we will be talking about energy security, as it plays a critical role in Canada's negotiation power. Of course, Canada has what the world needs. We have energy, critical minerals, expertise and innovation, so we have a lot of what the world needs."
"Madam Chair, it is common knowledge that the United Kingdom is a unitary state."
The hon. member for one last question.
"Like my hon. Friend, I have a constituent, Jamie Tierney, who, sadly, suffers with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  Recently, he has been able to begin treatment, as have other patients in Scotland, but it took a lot of work and in some cases intervention by lawyers to get that. Jamie's family tell me that ""Time is muscle"". Does my hon. Friend agree that the sooner we make givinostat available across all parts of the UK, the better it will be for those people?"
"Madam Speaker, let us look at some facts. In 2022, inflation was 8.1%. We have driven that down, per our policies, to 1.7%. Members of the party opposite hold themselves up as strong economic stewards. They are not. Under their previous governments, our economy failed. We are going to aggressively rebuild our economy back by investing in Canadians. It is time for all Canadians to come together."
"I thank the Foreign Secretary for his statement. It is essential that we have a fuller understanding of the reach of China, as well as of our goals. British citizens have contacted me about the human rights violations, not only against those in China but those who live on our shores. Will the Foreign Secretary ensure that China understands that its reach stops before our shores, and that our people are entitled to think and have freedom of speech whenever they desire, without any fear of reprisal?"
"Mr. Chair, I was a minister of immigration provincially for eight years. I have seen what this country has gone—"
"Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to Bill C-2 , the strong borders act. I want to begin by thanking our dedicated officers from the Canada Border Services Agency, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and our frontline men and women who serve within our local police forces, as well as those who serve within our national security apparatus. I thank all of them for their service and their commitment to keeping us all safe. Our border is maintained through rigorous enforcement, advanced technology and strong domestic and international partnerships. Although there is more to be done, this new government was elected in part to take concrete action in order to keep Canadians safe. This is why the bill in front of us, the strong borders act, is so important. The bill would ensure that law enforcement has the necessary tools to keep our borders secure, combat transnational organized crime, stop the flow of illegal fentanyl and crack down on illicit financing and money laundering more broadly. These measures would bolster our response to increasingly sophisticated criminal networks while ensuring that we protect Canadians' privacy and charter rights. One of the key goals of this bill is to strengthen the government's effort against illicit financing and money laundering. We know that money laundering supports and perpetuates criminal activity by allowing criminals, such as fentanyl traffickers, to profit from their illicit activities and then reinvest in their criminal enterprises. This makes strong and effective anti-money laundering controls a critical component of keeping Canadians safe. Bill C-2 would strengthen Canada's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime through stronger penalties for financial crimes and by addressing the most prevalent forms of money laundering. It would enhance public-to-private information sharing and strengthen the supervision and compliance of financial institutions and other businesses and professionals with anti-money laundering obligations. The strong borders act proposes a comprehensive set of amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act to ensure that businesses and professionals regulated by the act are effective in detecting and deterring money laundering. This means strengthening the administrative monetary penalty framework through increased civil and criminal penalties while establishing safeguards for small businesses so they are not disproportionately penalized. The strong borders act would enhance compliance program requirements and enforcement. It also means punishing serious criminal non-compliance by increasing the limits for all criminal fines 10 times. The stronger penalties proposed for non-compliance would better align Canada with other countries, including the United States and the European Union. The strong borders act would also introduce a new offence for the provision of false information to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, more commonly known as FINTRAC. We will strengthen the anti-money laundering framework and support the fight against financial crime more broadly—"
"Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from Northumberland—Clarke. We worked together in an informal rail caucus to promote the use of passenger rail. It should be linked with affordable bus transportation. Most Canadians cannot afford to get from place to place on public transit, because it is so limited. There are many great projects; I grant him that, and I would love to see them move ahead: an east-west, north-south electricity grid and an interlinked passenger rail and bus system. There are many projects in the national interest, but we do not know what they will be, and the factors in the bill are not requirements. We could have a great project that we all want to see go ahead or we could have a nightmare, and right now, there is no way to know the difference. We have to just cross our fingers and hope that the government's plans are good ones, because this, as the old expression goes, is a pig in a poke or a blank cheque. That is what we are passing when the bill is forced through."
"Madam Chair, I do not wish to offend the journalist, but unfortunately I have not had a chance to read that article. However, I am sure that my colleague is about to tell me what it said."
"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General released a scathing audit this week on the top arrive scam contractor, GC Strategies. This two-person company, under RCMP investigation, received a jaw-dropping $64 million from the Liberals. The old ministers responsible for this all got promoted by the Prime Minister and are sitting as ministers right there, right now. Canadians are incensed by these same old Liberal ministers continuing in their corrupt ways. A simple question for the Prime Minister, when are Canadians going to get their money back?"
"Mr. Chair, it is $1,265.46 per person. What is the per capita breakdown for Canada's debt currently?"
"The right hon. Gentleman raises an important issue; let me take this away. As we embark on this golden age for nuclear, we need to make sure that the supply chain really benefits. Perhaps he could furnish my Department with the details so that we can think about how such companies can benefit?"
"Park homes, and particularly the site owners' commission on sales, are regularly raised with me at business questions. I am sure a debate would be very popular were my hon. Friend to apply for one. This Government will set out actions on this in due course, and I encourage him to speak to the relevant Minister, which I am happy to facilitate."
"Mr. Speaker, we agree to apply the vote, with the Conservatives voting against."
"I think it has been fairly clear from proceedings in the House that the Government have said that we agree that Iran should not have a nuclear weapon, but that, in this instance, we are very keen that diplomacy is the way forward."
"Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank the people of my riding, Beauport—Limoilou. I want to mention that I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the member for Rivière-des-Mille-Îles . I am pleased to take part in today's debate and to reiterate the immediate priorities of our government to make life more affordable for all Canadians, including Quebeckers. The Canada carbon rebate was implemented to return the majority of direct proceeds from the federal fuel charge to residents of provinces where it applied. It did not apply in Quebec. The emissions reduction plan contains a complete suite of mitigation measures, strategies and investments, including policies that complement carbon pricing. A price on pollution for major emitters will continue to be a pillar of Canada's plan to build a prosperous net-zero economy and make progress on climate objectives. The government intends to refocus federal carbon pollution pricing standards on ensuring that carbon pricing systems are in place across the country on a broad range of greenhouse gas emissions from industry. It will reinforce Canada's approach to carbon pricing for industry to ensure its continued effectiveness. The federal government intends to work with the provinces, including Quebec, the territories, indigenous peoples and stakeholders on changes to the minimum national stringency standards for carbon pollution pricing, known as the federal “benchmark” criteria. The changes would ensure that industrial pricing systems continue to maximize emissions reductions and encourage the transition to low-carbon technology, while protecting industry against competitiveness and carbon leakage impacts. By improving its emissions performance, Canadian industry will become more efficient and maintain its competitive edge as Canada works to diversify its trade relationships and deepen its market access, particularly in jurisdictions that, like the European Union, increasingly value low-emissions goods. The goal of the benchmark criteria would continue to be that systems are similarly stringent, fair and effective. The review will look at opportunities to strengthen industrial carbon markets to provide the necessary incentives for major industry-wide decarbonization projects, while creating jobs and spurring investments in the technologies that will shape the clean economies of tomorrow. Thanks to the elimination of the federal fuel charge effective April 1, 2025, eligible Canadians received a final Canada carbon rebate payment on April 22. The government decided to make this final carbon rebate payment to eligible households in April since Canadian families in the provinces subject to the federal fuel charge, especially low-income families, were counting on the April rebate. Last week, we introduced Bill C‑4 , which would officially remove consumer carbon pricing from Canadian law once it is repealed. This bill would also reduce the cost of living so that Canadians, including Quebeckers, can keep more of their paycheques to spend on what matters most to them. It includes a middle-class tax cut effective July 1, tax relief for close to 22 million individuals in Canada and $840 in savings per year for two-income families. As we have also clearly stated, this cut will primarily benefit the hard-working Canadians who need it the most. The bulk of the relief would go to people in the two lowest tax brackets, those earning less than $114,750 in 2025. Within this group of working Canadians, nearly half of the tax savings would go to those in the lowest tax bracket, those earning $57,375 or less in 2025. We can deliver these tax savings quickly to Canadians because, when our middle-class tax cut was announced, the Canada Revenue Agency updated its source deduction tables for the July to December 2025 period so that employers and payroll administrators can reduce tax withholdings starting July 1. We will also eliminate the GST for first-time homebuyers on new homes up to $1 million, which will save them up to $50,000. We will cut the GST for first-time homebuyers on new homes between $1 million and $1.5 million. This will result in a significant increase in the already substantial federal tax support available to first-time homebuyers through programs such as the tax-free first home savings account, the home buyers' plan, the registered retirement savings plan and the first-time homebuyers' tax credit. This will help more young people and families achieve their dream of home ownership. Thanks to these measures, we are making changes to lower taxes, we are lowering costs and we are putting more money in the pockets of Canadians and Quebeckers. Those are just some of the ways the government is making life more affordable. The government will also maintain the programs that are already helping families save thousands of dollars every year. As His Majesty said in the Speech from the Throne, in all of our actions, the government will be guided by a new fiscal discipline: spend less so people can invest more. We will balance the government's operating budget over the next three years by cutting waste, capping the public service, ending duplication and deploying technology to improve public sector productivity. That is why we are committed to presenting the details of our plan in the fall in a comprehensive, effective, ambitious and prudent federal budget. One of the key priorities that we have discussed and focused on since the start of our mandate is to improve the efficiency of government spending. We are looking for areas where we can cut costs and improve public service productivity. Day-to-day government spending, that is, the government's operating budget, has been growing by 9% each year. The government will introduce measures to bring that growth below 2%. In parallel, the government will take a series of measures to catalyze new investment to create better jobs and higher incomes for Canadians. As we have already mentioned, the government's overarching goal and core mission is to build the strongest economy in the G7. That starts with creating one Canadian economy out of 13. Internal barriers to trade and labour mobility cost Canadians as much as $200 billion each year. That is why we have introduced legislation to remove all remaining federal barriers to internal trade and labour mobility. Our government is working hard right now to meet Canadians' needs, and that includes making life more affordable across the country, including in Quebec, so that Canadians can keep more of their hard-earned paycheques."
"May I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his questions? He started by asking whether I have discussed with other G7 partners the question of US tariffs. Yes, we frequently discuss trade, the economy and, frankly, the challenges that those tariffs put in place for all economies. That is the sort of co-ordination and discussion that goes on all the time, and it will continue. On the troops in Estonia, I have visited them a number of times myself. They are incredibly brave, and they have a real sense of purpose. I can tell the right hon. Gentleman that, at NATO, the frontline states on the border with Russia were leading the charge in relation to the work that we had to do yesterday to renew and take forward the pledges that we make. The right hon. Member asked about reversing the cuts to the Army. We will begin the work of reversing those cuts. When the Conservatives came into government, there were 100,000 in our Army; when they left, there were 70,000. I think that is what Ben Wallace meant when he said they had ""hollowed out"" our armed forces. On the question of the assets, and whether they themselves can be seized rather than just using the interest, I have been discussing that with colleagues, as the right hon. Member would expect. It is complicated, as he knows. There is not one view, frankly, on this issue among colleagues and allies. I am very happy to see the proposals that he has received from Estonia, I believe, or any others, but it remains complicated. I have to say that allies are in different places on this, but we will continue to discuss it. On a ceasefire in Gaza and recognition, I think it is very important that we have been pressing the case, particularly, in recent days, quite urgently and in close collaboration with our colleagues--the E3 of Germany, France and the UK are working very closely together at the moment--to say that this is the moment to press on from Iran to a ceasefire in Gaza, and I mean that that should happen in days, not weeks or months. I do think there is a window of opportunity here. I hope that it  happens but I cannot predict that it will. I do think that all of us should do all we can to ensure that, along with a ceasefire in Iran, we push to that ceasefire in Gaza. On the question of recognition, it has long been our party's policy--this Government's policy--to recognise Palestine at the right time in the process to bring about the peace, because I think that without a two-state solution there is little prospect of lasting peace in the region, and that remains our policy."
I have to provide some time for a response. The Minister of Public Safety may give a brief response.
"In one of the wettest countries in Europe, we could face summer water shortages because we have not built a single major reservoir in over 30 years. Here is the real kick in the teeth: we have paid all those prices for rules that have failed even on their own terms. We have created endless hoops to jump through and poured public money into bizarre mitigation schemes while Britain has become one of the most nature-depleted countries on Earth. We have lost over half our ancient woodland and one in six species are at risk of extinction. We have got fewer birds, fewer butterflies and fewer mammals, and yet more paperwork than ever before. We should ask this: if these rules are not helping people and they are not helping nature, who on earth are they for? We throw money at scattergun mitigation--fish discos and bat tunnels--while failing to invest in strategic, landscape-scale restoration that actually works. We force every project to fit every issue on site, even when that is more expensive, less effective and totally irrational. That means tens of thousands of individual site-by-site protections, which are bureaucratic, inconsistent and scientifically out of date, and all despite the fact that modern ecological science is clear that nature recovery depends on scale and connectivity, not isolated microprojects."
What steps he is taking to reduce reliance on fossil fuels
The hon. member for Moncton—Dieppe.
"Mr. Speaker, the minister and all the Liberals members have a very short memory. Over the past 10 years, they passed at least four anti-energy and anti-natural resource bills. We are not just talking about Bill C‑69. We need to scrap Bill C‑48, the marine shipping ban, the oil and gas production cap and the industrial carbon tax. The world needs Canada now more than ever. When will the government repeal these laws?"
"The Treasury's use of that formula is the simple explanation for why we have left-behind towns across the whole of the UK. I value and welcome the fact that the Government have listened, and have resolved to overhaul the Green Book and use a place-based analysis as an integral element of the formula in future. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Andy MacNae) for his work with Ministers on this issue. That change is fundamental, because being left behind means failure. We had a Government who were only interested in the easy solutions, and were willing to see parts of the country become no-go areas for new industry and new opportunities."
(Bill agreed to) Shall I rise and report the bill?
"Mr. Chair, the minister said he got lists from the provinces and will receive more. Will he release the lists? Does he agree with the consensus of 79% Canadians and 80%—"
"Mr. Chair, on what date will the budget be balanced?"
"I wholeheartedly welcome this statement. It is a true Labour package that backs Britain and reverses years of declinism under parties on the Opposition Benches who seem to have given up on Britain. I particularly welcome the results of the Green Book review, which will get investment into the places that need it most. In that regard, does the Chancellor agree with me that, while big projects and city schemes will get the headlines, it is vital that the full benefits of renewal are felt in small towns like those that make up my constituency of Rossendale and Darwen, and that these previously left behind places must be at the forefront of our thinking as we develop local transport and infrastructure delivery plans?"
"Sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker; I was so absorbed by the debate that I did not hear you call my name. I congratulate the hon. Member for Blyth and Ashington (Ian Lavery) on securing this debate, which is important. In my constituency of North Shropshire, there are five market towns, but only one will have a commercial banking branch left after the closure of the NatWest in Market Drayton this year. We find ourselves in a situation of managed decline for rural constituents, with essential services slowly removed bit by bit every year. Just two months ago, I attended the opening of the Whitchurch banking hub, which is providing a vital service to a town of around 10,000 people that had lost its final bank branch. While that is great news for Whitchurch and the best alternative to a network of commercial banks, we must consider now those market towns that do not meet the criteria set by Link. For example, the lovely, historic, but quite small town of Ellesmere in North Shropshire has a population of around 5,000 people and 90 commercial units. It is a hub for a large rural area and there is no bank and no prospect of getting one, according to Link, because it does not meet the criteria. Ellesmere still has a post office, which is relied upon by local businesses for cash services. Having been the financial controller of a business in an area served only by a post office, I can tell the House that people need to do more than simply deposit and withdraw cash. Although I was a big fan of Prees post office and village store, if I needed to change the signatory on a bank account or set up a new one, it was a logistical nightmare; if I did not want to post valuable and sensitive documents, it required a half-day trip to a town with a physical branch. For someone in Ellesmere, the nearest town is Oswestry. To visit an actual bank in person is a 45-minute round trip on public transport. Someone living in the surrounding villages is in a difficult situation. Those residents might also have used their post office at some point, but now those post offices are being systematically closed down. In my constituency, from Knockin to Hadnall and from Weston Rhyn to Shawbury, outreach post offices have been closed in one fell swoop with a couple of weeks' notice. A Post Office representative sounded surprised recently when they told me that outreach services only available for one hour a week were not well used. It seemed not to have occurred to them that if the post office is only available for a single hour, that might not be terribly convenient. I have little time left, so I will just say that for places with poor digital access, where many people cannot access online banking, it is essential that we review the  criteria that Link uses to assess the need for a banking hub. A medieval market town that has been serving the centre of its community for hundreds and hundreds of years is on its knees because there is no access to banking. It is essential that we get those services back into high streets to revitalise towns such as Ellesmere and Wem as soon as possible."
"Mr. Speaker, the biggest benefit comes from having an attitude of a team Canada approach and working together with individuals who want to be able to build one Canadian economy. The real beneficiary is every Canadian. It does not matter the region of the country. We are talking about billions of dollars of opportunities that can be saved by developing and enhancing one Canada."
"Happy Labubu birthday, Mr Speaker! Our most climate-friendly nations require investment to adapt to the effects of climate change, but sadly a number of them are facing a debt crisis and are spending a lot of money on paying sky-high interest rates to lenders. Given that 90% of the debt contracts are governed by English law, will the Government ensure that private lenders take part in debt relief schemes in order to tackle the climate emergency effectively?"
"I recognize Caribbean American Heritage Month, celebrating the culture, contributions, and history of Caribbean Americans in Michigan's 12th Congressional District and across the country. Caribbean American Heritage Month, first recognized in 2005, was established after years of global efforts to uplift our Caribbean- American neighbors. Their vibrant culture and contributions to our country and throughout the 12th Congressional District has uplifted many of our communities. The Caribbean communities in northwest Detroit, as well as in the city of Inkster and throughout western Wayne and Oakland County, have created powerful legacies through food, beauty businesses, fresh markets, and nonprofits working to care for our families and new immigrants. Caribbean Community Services in my district, a nonprofit organization, has done an outstanding job in uplifting Caribbean history. Through their engaging events, Mr. Speaker, they have celebrated the rich cultural heritage of the Caribbean and its significant impact on our communities. Please join me in ensuring that our Caribbean-American neighbors throughout our country are recognized as we celebrate this month."
The House resumed from June 13 consideration of the motion and of the amendment.
"Mr. Chair, I disagree with the assertion the member is making. The consultation process that we are laying out will lead to the quicker approval of projects, projects that get done on time and on budget—"
Order. The hon. member has the floor.
"Mr. Speaker, can the minister tell us whether the government will be required to respect the factors listed in the bill on so-called national interest projects or not?"
The hon. member for York—Durham.
"Mr. Speaker, I can tell members where Canadians are making cuts. I have had conversations with families in my riding who are cutting back on groceries, skipping meals and putting off their bills. The government wants them to believe that a few tweaks to these policies are going to make the difference, but the truth is that the pain is still here. The carbon tax is still driving up prices. The debt is still ballooning, and the bill does nothing to stop that. Canadians need relief that lasts, not just relief that polls well."
"I welcome my hon. Friend's statement about the record funding going into our NHS. We are already seeing the benefit in my constituency, with millions of pounds going into investment in our hospital; that is so desperately needed to get waiting lists down. People were left behind by the Conservative party, and I note that there is still no apology to any of my residents who were left in pain and agony for years and years under their watch--not one word of an apology. One of the big challenges facing my constituents is accessing an NHS dentist--my hon. Friend knows about that from the time she came to visit me during my campaign. I am campaigning to get new dentists for my constituents in Gloucester, so will she help me to get a meeting with the relevant Minister to ensure that some of this record funding comes to Gloucester to get an NHS dentist for all my constituents?"
"Mr. Speaker, there have been discussions among the parties, and I think you will find that there is unanimous consent to adopt the following motion: That, notwithstanding any standing order, special order or usual practice of the House, Bill C-5, An Act to enact the Free Trade and Labour Mobility in Canada Act and the Building Canada Act , in Clause 4, be amended by replacing, in the English version, line 21 on page 15 with the following: “(3) The Minister must, not later than 30 days before the”"
Will the Minister give way?
"Mr. Speaker, I think it is important, and Canadians probably think it is important, that the Minister of International Trade knows how much in duties Canadian softwood lumber producers are paying. Let me tell him. It is over 46% for Canfor, over 26% for West Fraser and over 34% for all other producers. The Conservative government got a deal done in a matter of months. Why has it taken you nine years, with no deal?"
Will my hon. Friend give way?
"I thank my hon. Friend for bringing that important case to the House. Universal credit has no fixed hours requirement, but the connection between housing costs and universal credit, as she mentioned, is still a problem. I would be keen to look at the detail of her constituent's case. Universal credit was introduced with the promise that it would move people off benefits and into work, but that clearly has not happened as we need it to happen, so considerable work is under way to deal with the inadequacies of the mess that the Conservative Government left us."
Is that agreed?
The hon. member has the floor.
"As the House will know, we have incoming news of a terrible disaster involving a flight out of Ahmedabad in India. I know that the Leader of the House will want to say a few words, but, from the Conservative Benches--I am sure that I speak for the whole House--let me wish everyone involved and their families the very best. It would be a bad day this week if I did not mention the fantastic news of the knighthood of Sir Billy Boston--it is nice to be able to do that. I hope you will admire my restraint, Mr Speaker, in not mentioning your birthday and therefore not giving any incentive to any other Member of the House to mention it in their remarks either. I had the dubious pleasure, as you did, Mr Speaker, of listening to yesterday's spending review in this Chamber. It brought to mind President Abraham Lincoln's immortal line about managing to compress the greatest number of words into the smallest amount of content. I am afraid that the statement was somewhat worse than that. It was, in both its design and delivery, an exercise in distraction and sleight of hand--a document not of economic strategy but of political evasion. We should be clear from the outset that this was a spending review, not a Budget. Unlike a Budget, it was not subject to scrutiny by the Office for Budget  Responsibility. The Chancellor's figures have, therefore, not been externally verified. Her assumptions have not been stress-tested, and her projections have not been independently reviewed. She was not required to publish the full fiscal implications or to give the embarrassing numbers in her own remarks--and, of course, she did not. Even within the confines of departmental budgets, the presentation was, I am afraid, somewhat disingenuous. A final year outside the actual spending review period was included, filled with speculative figures designed to suggest rigour and restraint in budgetary control. This is the illusion of discipline without the reality of delivery. In case any Member is interested, this is on page 13 of the document. Elsewhere, baseline figures were conveniently shifted; most comparisons began from the year 2023-24, not the current year, which had the effect of inflating the apparent scale of any increases. Sizewell C is a classic example. The document trumpets a near 16% increase in investment. In truth, spending over the period is falling by 3.7%. That is on page 44. Similarly, on police funding, the Chancellor was very careful in her language to say that there would be an increase in ""police spending power"", but what she meant was that there would be an increase in the local authority precept: in plain English, a tax rise. The same obfuscation was at work with overseas development aid. The Chancellor has always said that ODA cuts were needed to fund defence, but the reality is that defence increases are almost entirely in capital spending, while ODA is a cash line. Far from funding our national defence, what has actually happened is that overseas development aid has been cut to prop up other Departments' day-to-day budgets. The most obvious case is defence spending: we were told in grand rhetoric that it would rise to 2.5%, and later 3%, of GDP at some undefined moment when fiscal circumstances allow. In fact, it is unlikely that even 2.5% will be reached this Parliament. The 2.6% quoted includes the single intelligence account, which suggests that the number is below 2.5%. The defence investment plan--the plan that will release the money--is unlikely to appear until the end of the year. That is nearly 18 months after the 2024 general election--this at a time of war in Ukraine, and with China potentially positioning itself for conflict over Taiwan by 2027. On Monday NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, echoed yesterday by no less than Lord Robertson, said that unless NATO members raise defence spending to 3.5%, with an additional 1.5% in wider support, we may as well ""start learning Russian"". That is the strategic context. The Government's response has been to dither and delay. The Chancellor's U-turn over the winter fuel payment badly damaged whatever credibility she ever had. Yesterday's statement has compounded the problem for her and the Government. No mention was made of the estimated 5% annual council tax increases now expected, as flagged by Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. No admission was made that the review will add PS140 billion in new borrowing. That is an extra PS10 billion a year in interest payments, at current rates, by the end of the period. Meanwhile, the supposed efficiency savings of nearly PS14 billion are widely regarded as illusory. As the Chancellor herself said about the spending review, these are her choices. But the truth is plain: there will be a tax cut for the people of Mauritius. For the rest  of us, the spending review was a gigantic speculative splurge of spending, presented via smoke and mirrors, which will end up, as it always does with Labour, with higher taxes, and British taxpayers will have to bear the impact."
"Mr. Speaker, since this morning, much of the discussion has focused on the economic aspect of the issue. I am keeping a close eye on this issue, particularly with regard to the automotive industry. The riding of Shefford, including the city of Granby, is known for its many car dealerships. This industry is very strong in Shefford, so I keep abreast of the situation and meet with dealerships on a regular basis. I found an email that the Automotive Industries Association of Canada sent me recently. I was checking to see what issues there are with zero-emission vehicles, electric vehicles. However, the email mentioned the right to repair cars, but also, and more importantly, the impact of tariffs on the automotive industry. Does my colleague agree that, when it comes to the economy, there are many other issues that should be addressed well before this one?"
"I agree with my hon. Friend. The Conservatives failed to deliver a plan for our defence industry, and left our homes for heroes in poor condition; and while Plaid Cymru plots to leave NATO, and Reform cosies up to Putin, Labour invests in our military, our security and our veterans."
"Mr. Chair, if the minister cared about seniors, he would know the critical information. Why has he done nothing to bring the price of homes down for seniors?"
"Mr. Chair, I wonder whether the minister knows how much in countervailing duties from the forestry industry is currently sitting on deposit in the United States. Does the minister know how much money is currently in the United States?"
"I was necessarily absent from votes today. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 152, NAY on Roll Call No. 153, YEA on Roll Call No. 154, and NAY on Roll Call No. 155."
"No. On new clauses 85 and 86 about neighbourhood policing, it is clear that this Government are starting to implement our neighbourhood policing guarantee. On new clause 13, introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool Riverside (Kim Johnson), the Government recognise the serious consequences that can result from joint enterprise convictions. However, joint enterprise ensures that those who act together in committing a crime are all held responsible. We saw that in the cases of Ben Kinsella and Garry Newlove, as well as many others. We are aware of the concerns raised by my hon. Friend and we will continue to look at that. I apologise to right hon. and hon. Members for not being able to get through all 100 amendments that were tabled. I also need to leave time for the person whose new clause leads the group to respond."
"I rise in support of the GENIUS Act. Today is a good day to watch a bipartisan coalition do what we were sent here to do: work on behalf of the American people. Today, the United States can take a bold and historic step forward not just for financial innovation, but also for American leadership, consumer protection, and economic opportunity. With the bipartisan GENIUS Act, we can do more than just pass a bill. We can deliver results for the American people. We can bring clarity for a sector that has been clouded by uncertainty, and we can make it known: The United States will lead, not follow, in the digital asset revolution. When I became chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, I promised to prioritize innovation, accountability, and smart regulation in the evolving digital economy, and we have the opportunity to deliver on that promise. The GENIUS Act will be the most significant digital assets legislation ever to pass the U.S. Senate. It is the product of months of bipartisan work. And I also want to thank the bill's sponsor Bill Hagerty, who went out of his way to make this legislation a bipartisan success by partnering with Senator Alsobrooks, working with Senator Gillibrand, along with our colleagues on this side of the aisle, Senator Lummis, and myself. I am incredibly proud to see the hard work of Senator Hagerty pay off--not for him but for the American people. That is what makes this process such a special one. It is what makes the U.S. Senate the most deliberative body in the world today. This is a victory for working families, small businesses, and everyday Americans who deserve faster, cheaper, and safer access to financial services. It is a win for innovation because this framework will give entrepreneurs the confidence to build here in the United States of America and not abroad. And it is a win for national security, because the GENIUS Act brings stablecoin issuers under strict anti-money laundering standards, cracking down on bad actors at home and abroad. Let me be clear, this did not happen by accident. It happened because we led. To those who said Washington could not act, to those who doubted bipartisanship, let's prove them wrong. Let's show that principled leadership, conservative values, and common sense can still move this country forward together. And I would not be complete in my comments if I did not stop and thank the Senate Banking staff for their hard work and their dedication. It would be incomplete if I did not stop and thank Senator Hagerty's staff for their hard work, countless hours; and Senator Gillibrand's staff for her dedication and their dedication to this issue; and, certainly, Senator Lummis and her staff, who spent countless hours making a good product better. Let's finish the job and get this bill to President Trump's desk for signature."
"I rise today in recognition of Caribbean- American Heritage Month, a time to celebrate the profound contributions of Caribbean Americans to our Nation's fabric. From our kitchens come flavors that have influenced American cuisine. Our music echoes across the mainland, starting with Caribbean- American children in the late seventies in the Bronx founding what became hip-hop and rap music. Our entrepreneurs have built businesses. Our educators have shaped minds, and our artists have colored the American cultural landscape. Our military and revolutionary mindsets have given Americans Haitian troops during the Revolutionary War, Denmark Vesey during slavery, Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte during the civil rights movement, and Colin Powell for his shock and awe. We have produced judges, athletes, and public servants who carry forward the Caribbean values of hard work, family, and community. During this Caribbean-American Heritage Month, we honor not just Caribbean Americans, but the enduring spirit of a people who transformed challenge into opportunity, who preserved culture while embracing innovation, and who continue to strengthen America's promise of diversity and inclusion.

"New research shows that foreign nationals are claiming almost PS1 billion in benefits each month. We now face the highest number of asylum claims ever recorded--up another 9% since Labour took office. Meanwhile, the 42,000 appeal backlog at the end of 2024 is projected to more than double to almost 100,000 by the end of this year. The Home Secretary herself has admitted to the media that her White Paper would cut immigration by just 50,000. This is utterly inadequate. Without real deterrence and stricter measures, the visa processing delays will only worsen, so will the Minister commit to two concrete measures: implementing the previous Conservative threshold of PS38,000; and introducing a legally binding annual migration cap that actually delivers accountability?"
"I rise in celebration that yesterday was the third anniversary of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which overturned the disastrous 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, a major victory for the pro-life movement. This decision rightfully reaffirmed that ending the life of an unborn child is not a constitutional right. While this was a step in the right direction, there is still much to be done to protect the lives of our Nation's most innocent. Modern science objectively proves that new, distinct human life begins at the moment of conception. It is truly incredible that, with today's technology, we know that a baby's heartbeat starts at just about 22 days after conception, their unique fingerprints are formed at 12 weeks of gestation, and by 15 weeks, the baby is sensitive to pain. That is why I have cosponsored the Life at Conception Act, which legally recognizes the life and value of an unborn child regardless of their size or level of development. Additionally, at the start of this Congress, I reintroduced legislation to recognize January 22, the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, as the Day of Tears to memorialize the unborn victims of abortion. Since the Dobbs decision, the fight to protect the unborn is far from over, given the issue of abortion was handed down to the States. Therefore, abortions are still occurring across the country, and the rapid rise in access to the chemical abortion drug, mifepristone, is deeply alarming. It is estimated that mifepristone accounted for 63 percent of the abortions in 2023, resulting in approximately 642,700 unborn babies losing their lives that year. Women and girls have been misled into believing that taking mifepristone to induce an abortion is as safe as using Tylenol. However, new data indicates that nearly 1 in 10 women taking the chemical abortion pill experience serious complications, such as sepsis, infection, hemorrhage, or another serious adverse event within 45 days of taking the drug.  {time}  1830  Mr. Speaker, this real-world complication rate is 22 times higher than the FDA currently acknowledges on the mifepristone label. Additionally, the Biden-Harris administration removed the requirement for a woman to receive these drugs in person from a healthcare provider. This in-person requirement allowed providers to determine gestational age, rule out life-threatening ectopic pregnancies, and identify signs of abuse before dispensing mifepristone. This change not only poses serious, irresponsible medical risks but also bypasses pro-life State laws, like what wehave in Georgia, by permitting the shipping of abortion pills. Let me give you an example. This is a package, a brown envelope. This was ordered online with a simple filling out of a form, answering a few questions, and putting in your name and address. It showed up about a week later. If you look at the return address, it is fake. It says: James Smith, 2301 L Street Northwest, Washington, D.C. That is the West End Library here in Washington. It was postmarked from Capital District 208 here in Washington, D.C. In this package, in this brown envelope, are three packages. One, two, and three are the only marks on them. They are mifepristone and the drugs that induce an abortion. They are so easily accessed online, sent free of charge--but to whom? I believe that any abortion is a tragedy. I also recognize that while mifepristone is still legal--and I hope that one day it is not legal and is banned because it is responsible for so many murders of unborn children. While it is still legal, for the well-being of women and girls, we must investigate the safety and efficacy of mifepristone and reinstate in-person dispensing requirements for the abortion drug. Every life is a gift from God. As leaders, our greatest responsibility is to protect the life and liberty of every person, especially our most innocent. After all, our first and most fundamental right is the right of life. Think about it. Think about the first document that birthed our Nation, the Declaration of Independence. ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.'' What was the first right mentioned? The right to life. We as a government have a responsibility to protect that life, especially the life of an innocent unborn child. Abortion is not the solution. We must have compassion for both the unborn and pregnant women who are struggling. That is why I am pleased to know that, in Georgia alone, there are over 670 organizations that offer support and care for pregnant women. As we celebrate the victorious anniversary of the Dobbs decision, I remain resolute in defending the sanctity of life and protecting the precious unborn. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman) for yielding."
Does the Secretary of State support the action taken by the United States to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities?
"Mr. Speaker, as the member well knows, we act in a federal jurisdiction. This bill eliminates federal exemptions to interprovincial trade and is an important piece of leadership as we move forward.

Can we increase the tempo to ensure that there are fewer disappointed colleagues?
"Madam Speaker, what is most important right now is what the government plans to do with respect to the energy industry, which, as I have stated in this House, is the lifeblood of my community in Calgary Signal Hill. We do not need more empty promises. We need results. We need a commitment to repeal Bill C-69 . We need a commitment to repeal Bill C-48 . We need a scrapping of the production cap on oil and gas. Those are the issues that are of greatest importance in my riding. I would invite the member opposite to make that commitment today on behalf of his party."
"I suggest that, in future, shorter questions might prevent mistakes such as ""you""."
"Mr. Speaker, the top producing countries for oil in the world are the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Russia. Russia is number three, just ahead of Canada. Do either of the ministers, or anybody in the government, realize that when we refuse to sell Canadian oil and gas to the world, countries are forced to buy that oil from Russia? Therefore, the Canadian government's energy policy is a pro-Russia energy policy. Does that seem reasonable to either minister?"
"Madam Speaker, I could not agree more. As we saw multiple times before the campaign and after the campaign, the Prime Minister took his fake little red book and signed it like he had some sort of presidential executive powers, which he simply does not. He is trying to jam this bill through as fast as he can. If he had really wanted to do it quickly, the fastest way to do it would have been to repeal Bill C-69 , repeal Bill C-48 , repeal Bill C-50 and remove the industrial carbon tax and the cap on energy production. That would have been the easiest thing to do. That would have opened the door to investment and to Canadians. It would have shown them that we are open for business. However, the Liberals did not want to do that, much like Cinderella's stepmother. They want to bring people to the ball. They want them to come, but they are putting on some impossible things for them to achieve knowing they will not be able to do it. That is what Bill C-5 is doing."
"People in Gaza are starving. Those people are children, the sick and the elderly. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is unworkable and its operations are insufficient. Will the Government not just press for but develop an alternative plan for taking aid into the strip through a humanitarian corridor sponsored by the UN?"
"Mr. Speaker, it is always an incredible moment for me to answer my colleague's questions. He is often in the House. To answer his question, extortion has become a plague in Canada. It is very disconcerting to see the amount of extortion that is occurring and these strong measures would help in combatting that. Right now, we see the increase of such situations and so we are going to fight against this and other transnational crime."
"I rise today to recognize Isabella Garcia for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.

It is my honor to congratulate Isabella Garcia on achieving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award."
"obviously, this is an important bill from a consumer safety point of view. I urge all my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time."
"Mr. Speaker, we are keeping the industrial carbon pricing, which is three times more effective than the consumer carbon pricing. First of all, we have to talk about the fact that Canada has been a leader at home and internationally on climate change, and it will continue to be. Instead of rewarding the biggest polluters and making Canadians pay for our new climate plan, we will build more green jobs. Our area, that of my colleague and I, has new jobs in the green sector for the EV sector. That is something we want to continue to work on to make sure that green jobs are kept across the country. We are the government that believes in climate change and the real threats of climate change. If members want to go outside, they can see it. We will continue to do so."
I give way to the hon. Member for North Herefordshire as I cited her.
"For some families of victims, further review of release decisions can provide some solace, but it cannot do so for my constituent Doreen Soulsby. Her daughter's murderer was released before the Victims and Courts Bill passed through this place. Will the Minister meet Doreen and me to discuss clause 61 of the Bill and the release of life prisoners?"
"Mr. Chair, we are here to talk about the main estimates. I am not sure how that is relevant. What I would like to point out is that the First Nations Major Projects Coalition put out a press release the day that—"
"Mr. Speaker, Canadians were shocked to learn that the Indian prime minister, Prime Minister Modi, has been invited to the G7 meetings here. This is deeply troubling and hurtful for the Sikh community and for all Canadians who are concerned about human rights and foreign interference. Now we find out that the Saudi leader has also been invited. Honestly, the G7 leaders' summit is becoming a showcase of tyrants. Will the Prime Minister rescind those invitations and make sure that the people coming to the G7 summit believe in human rights and believe in people, not profits?"
"Mr. Speaker, my colleague likely does not know this, but I served in the House from 2015 to 2019. I am a revenant. The member likely has not seen me around. Yes, I have had the pleasure of representing the riding of Rivière-des-Mille-Îles once before. In response to his question, I would like to say that we were recently elected to take real action to make life more affordable for all Canadians."
"I thoroughly agree with my hon. Friend. It is brilliant to see her in Parliament as she has been a trailblazer on these issues, and I recognise the case that she has put forward extremely well. I recognise that this is a core economic priority for the United Kingdom, and it is great to see her as an advocate for that on the Government Benches."
"Will the Minister meet me and residents of Beech and Willow Rise in Kirby, where a combination of failed leasehold law, previous corporate entities and inadequate regulation risks leaving residents facing unaffordable costs and eviction?"
"I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman, though new to this House, brings so much experience. I agree with his sentiment."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1713, the Agricultural Risk Review Act of 2025, sponsored by Representative Lucas. H.R. 1713 aims to add the Secretary of Agriculture as a member of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, also known as CFIUS, when there is an agriculture-related issue. Recognizing the importance of safe food and of national security involving agriculture, H.R. 1713 also requires CFIUS to determine whether a national security review is necessary upon notification from the Secretary of Agriculture that an agricultural land transaction could somehow affect national security. I do not want to add my voice to what I regard as alarmist voices talking about: Oh, my God, foreign interests, maybe even China, will buy American land. Keep in mind that we need investment in the United States. When the Chinese buy a high-tech company, they can take that technology that is acquired back to China. When they buy farmland, they can't take the land back to China, and they can't take the food back to China unless we decide to let them. Of course, the President could step in in any kind of national emergency and prevent that. There is discussion that the Chinese will buy a farm near, a couple miles away from the main entrance to a military base, but, of course, they could also park a car next to the military base. They can be in an Airbnb next to the military base. They could rent a farm. I don't think that the purchase of farmland poses the risks that are being overblown. I don't think China can ship our topsoil back to China nor do I think that China can deprive Americans of the ability to eat American food. H.R. 1713 addresses these concerns, the concerns that people do have, by providing a path for the Secretary of Agriculture to notify CFIUS when those transactions, in the opinion of the Secretary of Agriculture, do pose a threat or at least a concern. This bill is identical to what Congress passed in 2024, but that was in an appropriations bill. Passing it again will make sure that we make this part of permanent statute. When we focus on the security of our agriculture, we should also note that arbitrary cuts are being made that will affect directly the poorest families in our country, particularly cutbacks to the SNAP program that provides safe nutrition to families that might otherwise go hungry.  We also noticed that the DOGE effort of Elon Musk, who apparently fortunately has returned most of his attention to his private businesses, not only illegally cut millions of dollars from U.S. Department of Agriculture activities but would deprive the Department of Agriculture with the expertise necessary to carry out this bill, and ofcourse, deprives the USDA of the staff it needs to prevent the spread of food-borne disease. Finally, I think the withdrawal of the United States from the World Health Organization and illegally ending American food programs also exposes the entire world and ultimately the United States to substantial risks. Remember that when somebody suffers from a disease abroad, that gives a chance for the disease to replicate, mutate, and then migrate back to the United States. I feel that H.R. 1713 does improve CFIUS. I urge my Republican colleagues also to work to protect SNAP, the USDA, and our efforts at global health. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time."
"I congratulate the Minister both on the Bill as it stands and on today's amendments. Near my constituency, there has been a troubling spate of recent incidents in which younger people, in some cases encouraged by older men, are filming themselves catapulting and injuring wildlife, and placing that footage on TikTok. The footage is deeply unpleasant, and I do not recommend anybody looks at it. Would the Minister agree that that behaviour goes well beyond antisocial behaviour, and may at some point require a ban perhaps on the sale of catapults, but certainly on their use for that purpose?"
"Madam Chair, I look forward to working with the Minister responsible for Canada-U.S. Trade as he advances discussions on this with our American counterparts. At the same time, Canada is ready to strengthen our trading relationships overseas, especially with partners who share our commitment to rules-based trade. Trade diversification is not just about avoiding the risks that come from relying too much on certain markets. It is also about helping us reach our full potential and positioning ourselves for success in tomorrow's global economy. Take, for example, the Indo-Pacific region. This region includes nations such as Brunei, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and many others. The Indo-Pacific is home to over four billion people and $47 trillion in economic activity. It is the world's fastest-growing region and home to six of Canada's top 13 trading partners. As a country, we cannot afford to forego opportunities for growth in overseas markets around the world. Canada remains committed to pursuing an ambitious trade agenda that opens new doors for our businesses and workers. Our new government will pursue trade agreements with the potential to open new opportunities and new markets for Canadian companies. These markets will give Canadian businesses opportunities to grow and succeed around the world. We will continue to push forward with negotiations for a free trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. This is a dynamic group of 10 countries representing more than 600 million people. For Canadian businesses, that means access to a vast and growing market, with opportunities across a wide range of sectors. Canada's trade and investment in Southeast Asia are expanding quickly across many sectors, including in natural resources, clean technologies, agriculture and agri-food, information and communication technologies, financial services, aerospace infrastructure and consumer goods. In addition, late last year, Canada concluded negotiations toward the Canada-Indonesia comprehensive economic partnership agreement, better known as CEPA. Indonesia is a fast-growing economy, and this agreement will put Canadian companies in a strong position to compete and succeed as Indonesia continues to grow. We look forward to bringing these new partnerships into force soon. We will also look to strengthen our relationships with European partners. The Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, also known as CETA, the free trade agreement in place between Canada and Europe, has already accelerated trade and investment between us and the European Union. We will keep working to further strengthen these transatlantic ties and ensure more opportunities for Canadians. While we look to expand and sign new agreements, we also must not forget that we have much more room to grow our utilization rates for our current trade agreements. Take, for example, CETA, which I previously mentioned. At this moment, our utilization rate is around 60%, and we can get that much higher. That tells us there are opportunities out there for growth, and I will sharply focus on showcasing Canadian expertise in multiple sectors in the region. They include agriculture, fishing, food products, consumer goods, energy, defence and aerospace. Building these international connections is key to expanding our reach and realizing the full benefits of these agreements. That is why it was a great privilege for me to represent Canada in Ecuador at the inauguration of President Noboa just a couple of weeks ago. While there, I focused on strengthening the relationships that will help both our countries implement and benefit from the free trade agreement we negotiated and concluded recently. I also had the opportunity to connect with regional leaders to strengthen ties between our respective nations. Our new government will ensure that Canadian companies are well supported as they pursue new opportunities in overseas markets, including those created by Canada's free trade agreements. Team Canada trade missions will be a part of this effort. In recent times, trade missions have introduced nearly 800 Canadian organizations to new partners and opportunities in nine Indo-Pacific markets. They have generated over 4,000 business meetings, and they have led to concrete outcomes for Canadian companies, many of which I visited. I would like to congratulate Canada's chief trade commissioner on leading the most recent team Canada trade mission to Thailand and Cambodia in May. This was an opportunity to showcase Canadian innovation and capabilities in fast-growing markets. In seeking out new opportunities overseas, Canadian businesses will be able to count on the support of Canada's trade commissioner service. Based in over 160 locations, Canada's trade commissioners provide tailored and practical advice to help businesses make the best decisions in their international business development. The trade commissioner service has offices all over Canada and the world, connecting real Canadian businesses with opportunities in other markets. This navigation is crucial to breaking down trade barriers for these businesses. Over 98% of businesses in Canada are small businesses, and we need to do whatever we can to support them. In terms of impact, I will let the numbers for last year speak for themselves. The trade commissioner service served over 10,000 Canadian clients. Let me highlight the fact that 80% of the services were for markets outside of North America. The trade commissioner service facilitated 1,300 business deals. Clients estimate the value of these deals to be over $6 billion. What is more is that the trade commissioner service boasts a client satisfaction rate of over 90%. The trade commissioner service also administers the CanExport program, which includes about $38 million approved last year to help over 1,700 small and mid-sized businesses enter new export markets. The new government will ensure that the trade commissioner service has the right tools and resources to continue providing effective support to Canadian companies as they look to diversify abroad. Trade diversification also means helping under-represented groups such as women, youth, indigenous peoples, visible minorities and 2SLGBTQ2+ entrepreneurs reach new markets. Canada's trade commissioner service is there to support members of these groups along their export journey, in collaboration with EDC and other partners. The new government will also provide the necessary policy direction to other partners in the trade portfolio. This includes Canada's export credit agency, Export Development Canada, better known as EDC. I am also pleased to report that EDC is continuing to help drive Canada's diversification. The corporation served over 1,500 customers and facilitated $13 billion in business in the Indo-Pacific region, just last year. EDC has also opened new representation in Japan, Vietnam and Philippines and served over 1,500 clients, as I said, with $13 billion in trade in the Indo-Pacific. The new government is committed to supporting businesses in expanding and diversifying their trade in markets around the world. Fortunately, we have a real advantage. I know that Canada is home to some of the most driven and competitive entrepreneurs, innovators and workers on the planet. Every day, they are out there building, creating and pushing themselves in new directions. That is why this government will make sure that we do everything possible to help them realize their full potential on the global stage by building up new opportunities and encouraging trade diversification. I would also like to take a moment to thank all of the officials, including my deputy minister, for all their support in making sure that businesses are able to diversify trade. Together, we can make Canada the G7-leading economy."
"Mr. Chair, my hon. colleague on the other side mentioned the future. Is it true that by 2050, 50% of our offshore will be a marine protected area?"
"Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to my colleague's speech and I wonder what guarantees we have. We have already talked about carte blanche. What I am talking about is not only the 13 acts and seven regulations that the government would be free to ignore, but also what we need to discuss before proceeding. I would like to ask my colleague a question. The Liberals are telling us that we must seize this opportunity at all costs. Do they mean an opportunity to govern as they see fit, without consulting anyone? What guarantees do we have?"
"Of course I welcome the continuing support for Scunthorpe steelworks, but may I gently remind the Chancellor that that support came seven months after I first raised the issue in the House, and we then had the panic of the Saturday sitting in April? The Chancellor mentioned support for the Viking carbon capture and storage project, for which, again, I have lobbied for a long time. Can she give me a little more detail about the timeframe?"
"Mr. Speaker, I listened to my hon. colleague's speech, and there is clearly an issue when it comes to energy and some of our regions. Our Prime Minister has been very clear about the goal of making Canada an energy superpower in both conventional and clean energy and of reducing our emissions. From that perspective, yesterday's meeting in Saskatoon was clearly a huge success. Can we count on the Conservatives to support working as a country made up not of 13 separate entities, but of one single voice?"
"Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that we did just hear a number from the member. That is great. I have heard that number before, in relation to just one segment of the bill. However, I do not believe the main part of the bill, which is the citizenship by descent for generation after generation, is covered by that number. We have heard estimates of hundreds of thousands of people. If we do not get numbers from the government, then how are we supposed to know? Can the member provide the number of how many people will be impacted by citizenship by descent? Will the government be providing that information for committee when we get to that work?"
"The hon. Member asks a good question and the answer is that it is a mixture. It is the philosophy of devolution that is important because mayoral combined authorities in particular can deliver in ways that will be different according to their specific priorities and needs. There has been a potential challenge to the Department in achieving national priorities. It is also worth noting that the main estimate for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government provides additional funding for the West Midlands and Great Manchester combined authorities, so there are other pots of money from other Departments that mayors can pool together to put to best use for their authorities. Will the Minister set out what happens if a devolved institution diverges from departmental priorities, for example by opting not to fund active travel despite the Department's objective to increase active travel? The future introduction of place-based business cases, as set out in the spending review, has the potential to transform how Government think about the value and benefit of transport interventions and outcomes. When business cases are reformed along those lines, we look forward to seeing a difference in how the Government draw and think about those connections."
I am sorry. I have already moved on to questions and comments.
"Madam Speaker, the minister says he wants Canada's economy to be the strongest in the G7. He must realize that we are lagging way behind our trading partners. The OECD report says, “The level of Canada's labour productivity lags its peers”, and Carolyn Rogers of the Bank of Canada said just last year that our productivity metrics is in crisis: “it's an emergency—it's time to break the glass.” The minister's predecessor, back in 2022, said that Canada's productivity challenges are an “insidious” problem. Does the minister really think that, after 10 years of recycled Liberal ideas, they finally they have the solution?"
What steps he is taking to support rooftop solar power projects
"Arts and culture play a huge part in all our communities and can play a really important part in economic regeneration, as they are doing in my hon. Friend's constituency. I join her in celebrating the reopening of those facilities and look forward to visiting soon."
"And Northern Ireland, of course. I will never forget the hon. Gentleman."
"I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his statement about this significant investment in the security of our nation. I was thrilled that the Prime Minister announced that there will be up to 12 new attack submarines, boosting growth in Scotland and keeping the UK safe for years to come. However, I was astonished to read over the weekend that the SNP Government in Holyrood are blocking investment in a specialist welding centre in Glasgow by withdrawing a PS2.5 million grant. If the SNP continues to block funding for that centre, will the Secretary of State confirm that this Labour Government will step in?"
"Again, Mr. Chair, I am not going to begin my time as transport minister by condemning those agencies under my care, but what I think—"
"That sounds like a great project. We are absolutely committed to recognising the role that community energy groups, like the Chipping Community Land Trust, can play in ensuring that communities directly benefit from the energy transition. The trust was awarded PS100,000 through the former rural community energy fund, and GB Energy is continuing that work through its community fund, helping to unleash the wave of community energy projects that the Secretary of State spoke about earlier. The Government and Ofgem will be working to tackle policy and regulatory barriers to these projects happening."
"Mr. Speaker, next week, Canada will host the leaders of the world's advanced economies at the G7 leaders' summit in Kananaskis. This meeting comes amid rising geopolitical tension and increasing disruption to global supply chains. As global challenges intensify, the G7 must meet this moment with purpose and with force. Can the Minister of Foreign Affairs share with the House Canada's priorities for this critical summer?"
"During recess, I visited Scottish Action for Mental Health's Redhall walled garden, which I am proud to say is in Edinburgh South West. It has operated for decades as a therapeutic horticultural centre, supporting adults with mental health problems. Like similar community mental health services across Scotland, it is now under threat: it faces potential closure due to chronic underfunding of integrated joint boards by the SNP Government. Does the Prime Minister agree that facilities such as Redhall walled garden should have been a priority for the SNP when deciding how to spend the record funding settlement that Scottish Labour MPs won for Scotland?"
"Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the member for Windsor West on an excellent speech today and on his advocacy. My heart goes out to his community, because I noted in Friday's release from Statistics Canada on labour market numbers that there is sadly a very high unemployment rate in Windsor. Numbers are high throughout southern Ontario. Unemployment is 7% nationally and 8.8% in Toronto but 10.8% in Windsor. Windsor has really borne the brunt of Liberal economic failures. At a time when the whole country, and particularly his city, is dealing with such high unemployment, what a disaster that the Liberals cannot even present a budget. They have no plan and no budget. I wonder if the member could share what the response has been in his riding to the high levels of unemployment and the failure of the Liberals to present a budget."
"Mr. Speaker, we look forward to presenting our budget this fall. I am from a place where we are taught to measure twice and cut once, and that is just what we will do. We will take our time. In an ever-changing world and economy, we need to do our due diligence to make sure we are putting every dollar forward that is best for Canadians."
"I and the Government have been very clear about our commitment to the continuous at-sea deterrent and to procuring the new Dreadnought boats and the new warhead, so I can give the hon. Member an absolute assurance on that."
I send a cloture motion to the desk.
"Mr. Chair, what was the price per gun the government paid for these?"
"Peacehaven in my constituency is a growing town, but it remains a one-road-in, one-road-out town. The daily gridlock and frequent roadworks on the A259 is the single biggest frustration and barrier to opportunity for my constituents. Will the Minister meet me to discuss how we can unlock that and provide a real boost to Peacehaven and neighbouring towns?"
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the MP on their first address in the House. I have to tell members that both my parents and grandparents grew up on farms. They were proud farmers. I too have values similar to the ones the member stated. My father repeated to me often that my word is everything. As it relates to Bill C-4 , we are offering a tax break for young families trying to buy their first home. I am wondering if the member supports that move in helping those young families attain their first home."
"I thank my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Irene Campbell) for opening this important debate, and I thank all hon. Members for their contributions. We appreciate that the use of animals in medical research stirs the strong emotional instincts of many people across the UK, including many colleagues here. The day when we can finally bring an end to animal testing cannot come soon enough. Sadly, however, that day is not here yet. Phasing out animal testing has to be done in lockstep with the development of safe, accurate and validated alternatives. The reality is that the technology is not yet advanced enough for alternative methods to completely replace the use of animals. Consequently, the carefully regulated use of animals remains necessary to protect humans and the wider environment. Animal testing continues to be required by international agreements, which all global medicines regulators follow, including the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Such testing is regulated through the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, known as ASPA. The Act specifies that animals can only be used in science for specific, limited purposes where there are no alternatives, where the number of animals used is the minimum needed to  achieve the scientific benefit, and where the potential harm to the animals is limited to the absolute minimum. This is known as the three Rs: replacement, reduction and refinement. The system also includes a three-tier system of licensing that licenses each establishment, project and individual involved in performing regulated procedures involving animals. New technologies including AI, as referred to by colleagues, do offer potentially revolutionary ways to create alternative technologies. That is why our manifesto commits us to partnering with scientists, industry and civil society as we work towards the phasing out of animal testing. As the first step, we will publish a strategy later this year laying out how the Government will support the development, validation and uptake of alternative methods, and officials are working on this as we speak. The strategy will set out how we will create a research and innovation system that replaces animals with alternative methods wherever possible and that places the UK at the forefront of international efforts to drive this agenda. I am proud to say that the UK is already world-leading in the development of alternative methods, and we are keen to utilise this technology as much as possible."
"I have nearly finished. I have had many such conversations over recent months with those who support the amendment, including with palliative care doctors, nurses, hospice staff, GPs, Hospice UK and Marie Curie. I thank them all for their constructive engagement with the Bill. I cannot imagine that anyone in this place is not truly grateful for the outstanding work done every day by the wonderful people working in palliative and end-of-life care in every one of our constituencies. Many of us, if not most of us, will have personal experience of the kindness and compassion that those people have shown to our own families and friends. But this is not an either/or conversation. Palliative and end-of-life care and assisted dying can and do work side by side to give terminally ill patients the care and choice that they deserve in their final days. Just as there should not be an either/or for dying people, there should also not be an either/or for us as legislators in having to choose between supporting assisted dying or other end-of-life choices. That is why I am supporting amendment 21:   to ensure that in this place we channel our energies into supporting all options available to terminally ill people--something that I have always committed to do."
"Mr. Speaker, old habits die hard. The Prime Minister promised to cut consulting fees but is now raising them by 37% to a record-smashing $26 billion this year. That is $1,400 for every Canadian household. He is doing it knowing that Canadians have not received value for money from these Liberal insiders. Why is the Prime Minister breaking his promise and increasing spending on consultants?"
"That is a problem, so we should be a little quieter. The hon. parliamentary secretary has the floor."
"We have had a lovely, light-hearted debate for the most part. Does the hon. Lady agree that leaders of political parties have power through their words? Would she push for her party in particular to ensure that, when it comes to LGBT rights, we consider the humanity that we are talking about and do not whip up hate?"
"The Secretary of State will know that my local ICB in Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes is set to merge  with Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. The new ICB will cover a population of about 3 million people. Given the difficulties we have had securing a GP surgery in Wixams, will the Secretary of State set out how supersizing that quango will help rural mid-Beds to get the local healthcare it needs?"
"Last week, the Prime Minister had to get his lines from the Russian embassy. I think we all know that he is getting worse, and what he does not want to talk about is how he is going to make the economy better. That is what the people out there want to hear, and he has got no answers. His trade deals have unravelled. With the strategic defence review, everyone out there is asking where the money is coming from. The fact is that he does not know how to balance the books. The Chancellor says that the winter fuel payment U-turn will not be funded through higher borrowing, so will the Prime Minister admit that it will be funded by putting everybody's taxes up?"
"I rise today to recognize the outstanding contributions that Teresa Piechowicz has made to our community as a volunteer with the Hernando County Family YMCA. The Hernando County Family YMCA is more than just a place--it's a community, a support system, and a beacon of hope for so many. None of that would be possible without dedicated volunteers, like Teresa Piechowicz. Her unwavering commitment, boundless energy, and compassionate spirit make her an invaluable part of the YMCA family. Teresa's impact can be felt in every corner of the organization. She is involved in nearly every event hosted--always the first to arrive and the last to leave. Whether she's assisting with youth programs, supporting fundraising initiatives, or simply offering a warm smile to a member in need, Teresa gives selflessly--never asking for recognition, but always making a difference. Her enthusiasm is contagious, inspiring both staff and fellow volunteers. She has a unique ability to lift others up, ensuring that every person who walks through our doors feels welcomed and supported. Her kindness is not just in her words but in her actions--consistently stepping in wherever she is needed without hesitation. Without individuals like Teresa, the impact of the YMCA in Hernando County would not be what it is today. She represents the very best of what it means to serve others. It is clear Teresa Piechowicz has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility."
"Mr. Chair, I am participating virtually and sharing my time, which I believe is 15 minutes, with the hon. member for Edmonton Strathcona . I will start my questions to the hon. President of the Treasury Board through you, Mr. Chair. I have gone back to the 2021 mandate letter, the last I could find, to the President of the Treasury Board . I am wondering if he can tell us whether pursuit of the greening of government strategy, which was a priority then in 2021, remains a priority for the government."
Many residents in my constituency complain about motorcycle noise from illegally modified exhausts. Can the Home Secretary inform me of her plans to help local police and local authorities address this nuisance?
I thank the member. There is some discretion on that; it does change from time to time. I believe the chief government whip wishes to intervene briefly.
"The hon. Gentleman raises an important point that Members on both sides of the House have raised in different ways. It is absolutely part of what we are going to do to make sure that these jobs come to the UK. There are commitments around 70% of the supply chain spending being in the UK, and my Department will ensure that there is accountability on the part of the companies that will be benefiting from public money, to ensure that we see the maximum benefits across the country in the UK."
"Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest strengths of my district of Egmont is the willingness of Islanders to work together. That collective approach has built vibrant communities, and people know they can rely on one another to succeed. In my home community, the Tignish Fisheries Cooperative is marking a 100-year anniversary. Keep in mind that this incredibly successful venture began during a time of wooden boats, sails and oars. Today, it is electronics, fibreglass boats, efficient engines and the best seafood products in the world. The threads that bind these two realities together are the hard work and determination of a community filled with talented and dedicated people. Now, the Tignish Fisheries Cooperative employs 380 people, and it works wonderfully because thousands of individuals over the years believed in something greater than themselves. They had faith in their home. From its early days as a fisherman's union to the best seafood processing in the world, this operation has been an incredible success, and I want to congratulate all those there now, and thank those who came before—"
I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Alford).
"I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that of course we stand with our allies in the United States and Israel in facing down the repeated threats from Iran. The threat to Israel is existential, and the Iranians are destabilising the neighbourhood. Of course we will stand up to them."
"Madam Speaker, I have been listening to Conservative speeches all day long. One would think, from listening to them, that they were not going to vote in favour of this legislation, but not only are they going to vote in favour of it, based on what they have ultimately been saying, but they also voted to limit the debate on it only a couple of hours ago. Can somebody, perhaps this member, please explain the logic behind this to me, as to what is going on over there? Are they in favour of the legislation, or are they not? If they are not, can the member explain why he voted in favour of limiting the debate on it just a few hours ago?"
"Sleaford and North Hykeham is home to RAF Cranwell, RAF Digby, much of RAF Waddington and Beckingham training ranges. This defence review will be read with interest across the constituency. Many of my constituents serve in the armed forces, are veterans or work in the defence industry. Will the right hon. Gentleman give a commitment to the expansion of RAF Digby that is planned? Will he ensure that he supports the Greater Lincolnshire regional defence and security cluster, which was established in 2023?"
"Mr. Speaker, on Sunday evening, I was at an aluminum summit in Montreal. We talked to people in the industry. I have also been in contact with Quebec's minister of the economy. Of course, what is happening in the aluminum sector is very concerning. We are here to help manufacturers, unions, and of course, workers. We are going to use Canadian steel and aluminum in our major infrastructure projects, we are going to build a defence industry that will also help us create jobs in steel and aluminum, and we are going to diversify our international trade."
"The hon. Gentleman will know that the Foreign Secretary, the Prime Minister and many others raise human rights issues with the Chinese authorities on many occasions, and that we have given people from Hong Kong safe sanctuary in this country, which is something I am very proud of. The contribution to our country of those from Hong Kong is something we should all celebrate, but I will ensure that the hon. Gentleman gets a full response on the case he describes."
"I rise today to honor University of Arkansas softball sensation Bri Ellis, the Southeastern Conference and USA Softball Player of the Year in NCAA women's college softball in 2025.  Mr. Speaker, before I speak to her personal credentials, I will say the Razorback softball team had another banner season, albeit short of qualifying for the Women's College Softball World Series. The Hogs advanced to its fourth super regional in program history. Under Coach Courtney Deifel, Razorback softball has steadily climbed in the rankings over the last several seasons. Much of that success over recent years is clearly due to attracting quality players like Bri Ellis. Bri is a native of Houston, Texas. She is a graduate of Memorial High School in Hedwig Village, Texas, and is the 20th ranked player in the Nation. She signed with Auburn and played two seasons with the Tigers before entering the transfer portal and coming to Arkansas. As a junior, she became a first-team All-SEC player, and it got better in her senior season. This year, Bri hit .440, with 59 hits, 9 doubles, 26 home runs, and 72 RBIs. She posted a nation-leading 1.142 slugging percentage and a .646 on-base percentage.  Her talent and skills made things difficult on opposing teams, but no one sequence during the year better described this young lady's ability than a game against Georgia in the 2025 SEC tournament in Athens. Realizing her prowess, the Georgia strategy was to limit any damage Bri could inflict on the Bulldogs by refusing to pitch to her, effectively surrendering to her as a base runner, with nine straight pitches out of the strike zone. She was walked twice and then hit by a pitch in her first three at-bats but then came the bottom of the seventh and final inning. The score was tied at 1-1, and Arkansas had loaded the bases ahead of--you guessed it--Bri Ellis. One run wins the game. Georgia had to pitch to her. On the 10th pitch that she saw that day, Bri did what Bri does best. She launched one deep over the left-field fence for a walk-off grand slam home run. No moment in Razorback softball history fully captures the impact that this outstanding player has had on the sport in Fayetteville than that game. Softball experts, recognizing her accomplishments, made her only the fifth position player to win the Player of the Year honor. Bri Ellis didn't just elevate Razorback softball. She became a Bogle Field legend at Arkansas. I join her parents, Ron and Molly Ellis, and her sister, Emily, in congratulating Bri for an outstanding collegiate career and the legacy she leaves at the University of Arkansas. Go Hogs.  Honoring Wehiwa Aloy"
"I agree with my hon. Friend. We are fortunate that the Minister has a background in local government, so he understands those pressures. I look forward to further clarification on grey belt and building on brownfield first, which every constituency MP wishes to see, but it is not yet transposed on to local plans and the growth ambitions of this Government. I was about to come on to green belt and the changes to the national planning policy framework. Those changes will not solve the problems that we all have identified as the bottleneck in increasing development on non-green-belt land. Labour's policies unfortunately simply cause damage. In the spring statement, the Chancellor claimed that the planning reforms would be the main driver of the reduction in borrowing that she has promised. However, there is no obvious reduction yet in the money given to local authorities, with the amount estimated for the day-to-day spending of local government up 22% from the main estimate last year. Although the Treasury might celebrate that as being 3% less than budgeted at the spending review, this dramatic increase, along with the increases of 30% in communities day-to-day spending and 27% to the communities capital fund, is simply unsustainable. Labour continues to show how it prioritises areas where it has support to the detriment of rural areas, such as in my constituency, and areas in need of support around the United Kingdom. The cuts of PS101 million in the levelling-up fund and PS183 million in the UK shared prosperity fund are disappointing, and the non-delivery of the services grant and the rural services delivery grant will place pressure on services that are already struggling in rural and semi-rural areas such as my constituency, including bus services. Instead, Labour is rewarding poor financial management by Labour-run councils and mayoralties across the UK, with PS823 million being used for a recovery grant and a funding floor and the Labour-controlled Greater Manchester and West Midlands authorities receiving the first integrated settlements, which could cause an increase of over PS400 million in spending. Labour says that it is cutting local government costs by creating unitary authorities, but that is just placing greater control in their hands at the expense of local democracy. This estimate shows how little control Labour has over local government spending--and I will have to finish on that point. I look forward to hearing from the Minister how he will deal with these matters."
"I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and legacy of Dr. Richard Garwin, known to all as Dick Garwin, a physicist whose intellect shaped the modern world and whose conscience helped protect it. Dick was the principal designer of the first hydrogen bomb, a pioneer in national security and arms control, and a trusted adviser to Presidents spanning from Eisenhower to Obama. He authored over 500 scientific papers, held dozens of patents, and was a relentless advocate for using science in service of humanity. When I announced my support for the Iran nuclear deal, I was deeply honored to have Dick Garwin standing by my side. His presence carried immense weight, not just because of his expertise in nuclear weapons, but because of his lifelong commitment to reducing their threat. Dick's genius was matched only by his humility. He never sought fame, only progress. Mr. Speaker, may we carry forward his legacy with the same courage and moral clarity that defined his life.  The Neighbor Project"
"I want to understand who is making the rules about the spare parts pool. Surely if we are trading into that pool, we have a right to set the rules. If those components are going on to F-35s that are being bought by Israel, we have a right to block those parts or to kick Israel out, as we did with Turkey in 2019."
"Mr. Speaker, someone suggested earlier that folks are missing Prime Minister Trudeau. I am not so sure, but his government and this one have a few things in common because they are the same. That is why the Prime Minister always talks about the “new government”. At the end of the day, the only new thing about this government is the Prime Minister. As for those 44 MPs, supposedly Quebec loves them and loves what they do and cannot stop talking about how amazing they are. However, the 125 members of Quebec's National Assembly unanimously said that there is no such thing as one Canadian economy because we have our own institutions, and our institutions are valid."
"As the Member of Parliament for the largest Jewish school in Europe, may I thank the Foreign Secretary for his earlier assurances on safeguarding the community in this country? May I also commend the way in which he has diligently pursued a negotiated outcome to this destabilised situation? He knows that it used to be said that the Israeli Prime Minister jumped to the tune of America. Now that it seems to be the other way round, what action will he take against Prime Minister Netanyahu specifically, in order to stop the destabilisation of the middle east?"
"I congratulate the Minister on his robust stance on the UK nuclear deterrent, which I welcome. From a Whip's perspective, I am interested to know how he plans to bring his parliamentary party on side when so many have voted against the nuclear deterrent and Trident."
"I support H.R. 2351, I encourage my colleagues to do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time."
"Mr. Speaker, the Bank of Canada has warned that 40% of the amount of government debt issuance is purchased by non-bank financial actors, including hedge funds. If we are issuing record amounts of debt, does the minister agree that this represents a risk to Canada's financial stability, our credit rating and the rate at which Canadians have to borrow to pay for their mortgages?"
"Mr. Speaker, this week, we are celebrating National Public Service Week. This is a perfect opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding work of those who keep our country running smoothly every day. The public service of 2025 needs to take advantage of new technologies and AI, which can help us build a more agile and efficient public service. Our government will give public servants the tools they need to keep up their excellent work in serving Canadians. New technologies can make it easier to complete routine tasks so that public servants can focus on what matters: creativity, judgment and problem solving. To keep Canada strong, we need a strong public service. I wish everyone a happy National Public Service Week."

RULE 5--PROXIES  Proxies must be in writing with the signature of the absent member. Subject to the requirements of Rule 4 for the physical presence of a quorum to report a matter, proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and matters before the committee.

When the committee authorizes a subpoena, it may be issued upon the signature of the chairman or any other member designated by the committee. (b) Return.--A subpoena, or a request to an agency, for documents may be issued whose return shall occur at a time and place other than that of a scheduled committee meeting. A return on such a subpoena or request which is incomplete or accompanied by an objection constitutes good cause for a hearing on shortened notice. Upon such a return, the chairman or any other member designated by him may convene a hearing by giving 4 hours notice by telephone or electronic mail to all other members. One member shall constitute a quorum for such a hearing. The sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to elucidate further information about the return and to rule on the objection.

Rule 9--Treaties  (a) General.--The committee is the only committee of the Senate with jurisdiction to review and report to the Senate on treaties submitted by the President for Senate advice and consent to ratification. Because the House of Representatives has no role in the approval of treaties, the committee is therefore the only congressional committee with responsibility for treaties. (b) Committee Proceedings.--Once submitted by the President for advice and consent, each treaty is referred to the committee and remains on its calendar from Congress to Congress until the committee takes action to report it to the Senate or recommend its return to the President, or until the committee is discharged of the treaty by the Senate.

Rule 11--Travel  (a) Foreign Travel.--No member of the Committee on Foreign Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on committee business unless specifically authorized by the chairman, who is required by law to approve vouchers and report expenditures of foreign currencies, and the ranking member. Requests for authorization of such travel shall state the purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and financial report shall be filed with the committee within 30 days. This report shall be furnished to all members of the committee and shall not be otherwise disseminated without authorization of the chairman and the ranking member. Except in extraordinary circumstances, staff travel shall not be approved unless the reporting requirements have been fulfilled for all prior trips. Except for travel that is strictly personal, travel funded by non-U.S. Government sources is subject to the same approval and substantive reporting requirements as U.S. Government-funded travel. In addition, members and staff are reminded to consult the Senate Code of Conduct, and, as appropriate, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, in the case of travel sponsored by non-U.S. Government sources. Any proposed travel by committee staff for a subcommittee purpose must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and ranking member prior to submission of the request to the chairman and ranking member of the full committee. (b) Domestic Travel.--All official travel in the United States by the committee staff shall be approved in advance by the staff director, or in the case of minority staff, by the minority staff director. (c) Personal Staff Travel.--As a general rule, no more than one member of the personal staff of a member of the committee may travel with that member with the approval of the chairman and the ranking member of the committee. During such travel, the personal staff member shall be considered to be an employee of the committee. (d) PRM Travel.--For the purposes of this rule regarding staff foreign travel, the officially-designated personal representative of the member pursuant to rule 14(b), shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations.  Rule 12--Transcripts and Materials Provided to the Committee  (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep verbatim transcripts of all committee and subcommittee meetings and hearings and such transcripts shall remain in the custody of the committee, unless a majority of the committee decides otherwise. Transcripts of public hearings by the committee shall be published unless the chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking member, determines otherwise. The committee, through the chief clerk, shall also maintain at least one copy of all materials provided to the committee by the Executive Branch; such copy shall remain in the custody of the committee and be subject to the committee's rules and procedures, including those rules and procedures applicable to the handling of classified materials. Such transcripts and materials shall be made available to all members of the committee, committee staff, and designated personal representatives of members of the committee, except as otherwise provided in these rules.

(3) Classified transcripts or materials may not leave the committee offices, or SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center, except for the purpose of declassification or archiving, consistent with these rules. (4) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking notes or quotes from classified transcripts or materials. Their contents may not be divulged to any unauthorized person.

(7) In addition to restrictions resulting from the inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of a committee meeting or hearing, members and staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings of the committee in closed session or reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person would have been permitted to attend the session itself or is a member or staff of a relevant committee or executive branch agency and possess an appropriate security clearance, or unless such communication is specifically authorized by the chairman, the ranking member, or in the case of staff, by the staff director or minority staff director. A record shall be kept of all such authorizations. (c) Declassification.-- (1) All noncurrent records of the committee are governed by Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate and by S. Res. 474 (96th Congress).

(2) Any transcript or classified committee report, or any portion thereof, may be declassified, in accordance with applicable laws or Executive orders, sooner than the time period provided for under S. Res. 474 if: (A) the chairman originates such action, with the concurrence of the ranking member; (B) the other current members of the committee who participated in such meeting or report have been notified of the proposed declassification, and have not objected thereto, except that the committee by majority vote may overrule any objections thereby raised to early declassification; and (C) the executive departments that participated in the meeting or originated the classified information have been consulted regarding the declassification.  rule 13--classified information  (a) General.--The handling of classified information in the Senate is governed by S. Res. 243 (100th Congress), which established the Office of Senate Security. All handling of classified information by the committee shall be consistent with the procedures set forth in the United States Senate Security Manual issued by the Office of Senate Security. (b) Security Manager.--The chief clerk is the security manager for the committee. The chief clerk shall be responsible for implementing the provisions of the Senate Security Manual and for serving as the committee liaison to the Office of Senate Security. The staff director, in consultation with the minority staff director, may appoint an alternate security manager as circumstances warrant. (c) Transportation of Classified Material.--Classified material may only be transported between Senate offices by appropriately cleared staff members who have been specifically authorized to do so by the security manager. (d) Access to Classified Material.--In general, Senators and staff undertake to confine their access to classified information on the basis of a ``need to know'' such information related to their committee responsibilities. (e) Staff Clearances.--The chairman, or, in the case of minority staff, the ranking member, shall designate the members of the committee staff whose assignments require access to classified and compartmented information and shall seek to obtain the requisite security clearances pursuant to Office of Senate Security procedures (f) PRM Clearances.--For the purposes of this rule regarding security clearances and access to compartmented information, the officially-designated personal representative of the member (PRM) pursuant to rule 14(b), shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as members of the staff of the committee on Foreign Relations. (g) Regulations.--The staff director is authorized to make such administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this rule.  RULE 14--STAFF  (a) Responsibilities.-- (1) The staff works for the committee as a whole, under the general supervision of the chairman of the committee, and the immediate direction of the staff director, except     that such part of the staff as is designated minority staff shall be under the general supervision of the ranking member and under the immediate direction of the minority staff director. (2) Any member of the committee should feel free to call upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with committee business. Members of the Senate not members of the committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to time should be given assistance subject to the overriding responsibility of the staff to the committee. (3) The staffs primary responsibility is with respect to bills, resolutions, treaties, and nominations and other matters within the jurisdiction of the committee. In addition to carrying out assignments from the committee and its individual members, the staff has a responsibility to originate suggestions for committee or subcommittee consideration. The staff also has a responsibility to make suggestions to individual members regarding matters of special interest to such members. (4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as well informed as possible in regard to developments affecting foreign relations and national security and in regard to the administration of foreign programs of the United States. Significant trends or developments which might otherwise escape notice should be called to the attention of the committee, or of individual Senators with particular interests. (5) The staff shall pay due regard to the constitutional separation of powers between the Senate and the executive branch. It therefore has a responsibility to help the committee bring to bear an independent; objective judgment of proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to originate sound proposals of its own. At the same time, the staff shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of foreign affairs. (6) In those instances when committee action requires the expression of minority views, the staff shall assist the minority as fully as the majority to the end that all points of view may be fully considered by members of the committee and of the Senate. The staff shall bear in mind that under our constitutional system it is the responsibility of the elected members of the Senate to determine legislative issues in the light of as full and fair a presentation of the facts as the staff may be able to obtain. (b) Personal Representatives of the Member (PRM).--Each Senator on the committee shall be authorized to designate one personal staff member as the member's personal representative of the member and designee to the committee (PRM) that shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations where specifically provided for in these rules. (c) Restrictions.-- (1) The staff shall regard its relationship to the committee as a privileged one, in the nature of the relationship of a lawyer to a client. In order to protect this relationship and the mutual confidence which must prevail if the committee-staff relationship is to be a satisfactory and fruitful one, the following criteria shall apply, unless staff has consulted with and obtained, as appropriate, the approval of the Senate Ethics Committee and advance permission from the staff director (or the minority staff director in the case of minority staff): (A) members of the staff shall not be identified with any special interest group in the field of foreign relations or allow their names to be used by any such group; and (B) members of the staff shall not accept public speaking engagements or write for publication in the field of foreign relations. (2) The staff shall not discuss their private conversations with members of the committee without specific advance permission from the Senator or Senators concerned. (3) The staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings of the committee in closed session or reveal information conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person would have been permitted to attend the session itself or is a member or staff of a relevant committee or executive branch agency and possesses an appropriate security clearance, or unless such 13 communication is specifically authorized by the staff director or minority staff director. Unauthorized disclosure of information from a closed session or of classified information shall be cause for immediate dismissal and may, in certain cases, be grounds for criminal prosecution.  RULE 15--STATUS AND AMENDMENT OF RULES  (a) Status.--In addition to the foregoing, the Committee on Foreign Relations is governed by the Standing Rules of the Senate, which shall take precedence in the event of a clear inconsistency. In addition, the jurisdiction and responsibilities of the committee with respect to certain matters, as well as the timing and procedure for their consideration in committee, may be governed by statute. (b) Amendment.--These rules may be modified, amended, or repealed by a majority of the committee, provided that a notice in writing (including by electronic mail) of the proposed change has been given to each member at least 72 hours prior to the meeting at which action thereon is to be taken. However, rules of the committee which are based upon Senate rules may not be superseded by committee vote alone."
"Mr. Chair, on this side of the House, we want to build Canada strong. We want to invest in this country. We want to invest in workers. We want to invest in our industries. I know that the member wants a very ambitious and prosperous Canada."
"Before I move on to the amendment I want to speak about, I thank the Minister for the speed with which the Government have brought forward this Bill. It addresses important issues around protecting retail workers and tackling shoplifting and antisocial behaviour--issues that communities such as the towns and villages that I represent feel have been overlooked all too often. I really welcome the Government's urgency of action in recognition of the great campaigns fought by many unions, including USDAW, and also of the real sentiment of my constituents that these crimes need to be taken far more seriously. Today, though, I want to focus my time on amendment 19 to clause 94, in the name of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight East (Joe Robertson), which brings forward important legislative action on spiking. I do so on behalf of a constituent. I will call her Sarah today because, understandably, she has asked to be kept anonymous for the purpose of the story she wishes me to share with all Members, but that in no way diminishes the great bravery that she has shown in her work on this. It is a real privilege for Members of the House to meet constituents who, having experienced deeply traumatic, incredibly difficult moments in their personal life, show a resilience and depth of character that lots of us could not even dream of, and who turn their pain and personal trauma into a powerful force for change. That is deeply true of Sarah, and of so many women right across the country who have been victims of spiking. Sarah's story is her own, but it has themes that will resonate with far too many people here and across the UK. It starts on her birthday. Like most of us, she was looking forward to celebrating her birthday with her friends. They had organised drinks in a nearby town, and the night started off filled with fun and joy. It ended, though, with Sarah alone, traumatised, confused and unable to speak, in a car park outside the venue after she was spiked. Sadly, this horrific act is one that far too many women across the country are falling victim to. After she was spiked, Sarah tried to do what she could. She had lost control of her words. She tried to call out for help, but she felt unable to. An ambulance was called, but did not know what to do. It waited there with her, but did not take her to hospital or make sure that she got the aftercare and testing that she needed. She was left to fend for herself. What is really tragic is the fact that on top of all that trauma, and despite how difficult that moment in the car park must have been for her, it was not the only time in this experience that she felt alone. At every step--when she engaged with the police and the authorities, and when she pushed for action--she was ignored. There was insufficient action and insufficient focus. There was minimal follow-up and no prosecution, and the police took no further action on her case. Many of us--possibly including myself, if I am being completely candid--would be completely flattened by that, but not Sarah. She turned that pain into a mobilising force and a determination to push for action. Working with Spike Aware UK, she has been campaigning for a specific offence of spiking for some time, and she is as excited as I am to see that finally being brought forward by the Government in the Bill today. This real, meaningful change will ensure much more focus, much more action and hopefully much greater awareness of the damage that spiking can do, of the seriousness of the offence, and of the seriousness of the consequences that will hopefully now follow it."
"Mr. Chair, I am glad to hear that. I assume then that the minister believes that the lack of cancer care and access to drugs and treatment is an internal trade barrier."
"I start by appreciating the description of a rant--I will keep ranting on this point until I do not have to speak to my constituents waking up in temporary accommodation because of this country's failure to build. I note that there is a middle ground; in fact, it is even better than a middle ground, because through this Bill and the changes we are proposing we can improve the situation for nature and improve the situation for  building, including incentivising developers--for example through the biodiversity net gain process--to put swift bricks in place. What we currently have is not a conservation system, but a cargo cult, mimicking the symbols of protection while the reality on the ground gets worse. Contrast that with what protecting nature actually looks like, from this Government: a strategic land use framework that supports farmers to deliver climate and nature benefits across 1.6 million hectares of land--more than half the size of Wales; banning bee-killing pesticides; backing a transition to regenerative farming and planting forests on double the amount of land that will be needed to build the 1.5 million homes."
"I rise today to sound an alarm on a crisis threatening America's future. I am talking about the Trump brain drain. Donald Trump and Republicans in this House are launching a full scale assault on our Nation's ability to think, learn, and to innovate. Let's look at the facts. Trump's budget cuts funding for the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, STEM education, and even basic K-12 public schools. He has tried to crush public service loan forgiveness and gut Head Start, all while trying to give tax breaks to those who don't need them. This isn't cost savings. It is self-sabotage. In Dallas, we are home to UT Southwestern Medical Center, one of the top research institutions in this country. We have innovators, world- class hospitals, biotech startups, and studentsready to change the world. They can't do that when Federal research funding is drying up and educational support is being pulled out from under them. Dallas ISD alone has over 150,000 students, many from middle-class families. Cuts to programs like Head Start, Title I, and after-school STEM enrichment don't just hurt, they derail students' futures. Texas colleges and universities share one of the largest enrollments compared to almost any other State. Yet, under Trump's budget, millions of them would lose access to workstudy jobs and to affordable student loans. That is not just an educational crisis, it is an economic time bomb attacking our workforce development. This country has long been a magnet for global talent. Engineers, scientists, and doctors come here to help build our future, but Trump's anti-immigrant crusade is scaring them off. Whether it is blocking student visas, slashing green cards, or denying people their due process, he is slamming the door on the very people who fuel our economy. Dr. Kseniia Petrova, a brilliant Harvard scientist whose research could lead to breakthroughs in early cancer detection, was charged with a felony by the Trump administration for failing to declare preserved frog samples at customs, which is normally a very minor infraction handled by a mere warning. Instead, she is locked up in an ICE detention center in Louisiana, facing possible deportation to Russia. This isn't just cruel, it sends a chilling message to scientists and international students around the world: Come to America, and you may be imprisoned instead of empowered.  Then there is Ardem Patapoutian, who came to the U.S. from war-torn Lebanon at 18. He worked nights delivering pizza to become eligible for the University of California. Years later, with the help of an NIH research grant, he launched a lab making groundbreaking discoveries on how humans sense touch and went on to win the Nobel Prize in 2021. However, thanks to Trump's cuts to science funding, his Federal grant has been frozen. Just like that, China offered to fund his lab for the next 20 years in any city, any university, anywhere he wants. China is winning this war. That is what countries like China are doing. They are investing in students, in science, and in research because they want to win the future while Trump wants to only tweet about the past and harm American innovation. We should be doubling down on education and innovation. We should be building labs and funding scholarships, not building walls. Here is the truth: You don't make America great again by making Americans dumber. You don't build up the economy by draining it of talent and opportunity. This is not just about spreadsheets and budget lines. It is about real people: students trying to become the first in their family to graduate, young scientists working on the next breakthrough, and teachers trying to give every child a chance. Trump's budget doesn't just threaten programs. It threatens progress. We must fight back. Let's protect our students, support our researchers, and defend the right for everyone to dream big and achieve greatness in the United States of America."
"The member's time has elapsed, so we will resume debate. The President of the Treasury Board has the floor."
"families in our community are already struggling with rising grocery prices. It is shameful that companies like Kroger are price-gouging our residents with surveillance pricing. As you can see here, companies are already collecting a tremendous amount of data and private information about our residents to create custom profiles about them. Now, with electronic labels and facial recognition technology, this information is being used in real time to charge us more at the grocery store. Imagine if you were at the grocery store right now, and they charged you a higher price for an item because it used technology to determine that you were willing to pay more than the next person. Maybe it is hard to believe, but it is true. You look at this, and you can see that they are being very clear about the fact that they want to instantly change the price if it is hot outside, if it is something that you, again, have been looking at online. Now they are even adding the use of facial technology in grocery stores that not only raises serious concerns of privacy but also racial bias. We know that facial recognition technology discriminates against our Black and Brown neighbors. This is not just about discriminatory technology, Mr. Speaker. It is about corporate greed, and the CEOs are getting rich while working people struggle. It is essential that we work together in this body to protect our communities and ban these practices. I ask my colleagues to please support my legislation to ban surveillance pricing, digital pricing in grocery stores. Come and see me. You need to stand with your residents, not these corporations. Look at Walmart. Look at this: ``If it's hot outside, we can raise the prices of water and ice cream.'' That is what we are talking about. We need to protect our residents. Please, again, support my legislation.  Keeping Firearms Safe"
"The audit is a lot of work, and we have not even been in government for a year. We pledged to undertake an audit, we have undertaken that audit and what I have set out is comprehensive. There can be no no-go areas for the UK Prime Minister."
"We are providing PS200 million across England and Wales this financial year to increase neighbourhood policing. As part of our neighbourhood policing guarantee, every community will have named, contactable officers dedicated to addressing local issues. Alongside that, during the course of this year we will have 3,000 additional officers and police community support officers working in neighbourhoods teams. I am pleased to tell my hon. Friend the Member for Bracknell (Peter Swallow) that, for Thames Valley police, that will include an extra 68 police officers on the streets this year."
"The Leader of the House extols the virtue of parliamentary democracy, yet over half of MPs reject the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill. We have spoken to our constituents and to organisations representing disabled people. They reject the Bill, because it will cause harm to disabled people. Their voices have  not been heard, much though we are trying to amplify them in this place. Will the Leader of the House urge the Cabinet to withdraw the Bill, and instead allow a general debate on how we support disabled people?"
"I welcome this Labour Government's announcement on expanding eligibility for free school meals to any child with a parent in receipt of universal credit. This expanded entitlement means that nearly 8,500 children in years 3 to 11 in Luton South and South Bedfordshire will be eligible for free school meals. Can the Minister confirm that this expansion will not only support children's behaviour and attainment, but save their families up to PS500 per child per year?"
Whether her proposal to increase the standard qualifying period for settlement to 10 years would apply retrospectively.
"I rise to recognize the Puerto Rican Alliance of Northern Virginia for hosting and organizing their third annual festival. Virginia is home to a vibrant Puerto Rican community, and the festival celebrates the community's culture and contributions. It brings in vendors, volunteers, music, and a vibrant community. The festival made history in 2023 as the first-ever Puerto Rican festival in the DMV region. Each year, the festival draws over 10,000 attendees and continues to showcase the community's culture. The festival made history again in 2024 with over 18,000 guests in attendance. I thank the Puerto Rican Alliance of Northern Virginia, and I wish them a great event this year."
"Order. The hon. Lady said ""you"" twice."
"Mr. Speaker, Canadians have told us that they want us to build and retool our economy. The PM has been clear: We want to build a low-cost, low-risk, low-carbon economy. Canadians will build the infrastructure that makes us the strongest economy in the G7."
"I ask unanimous consent that privilegesof the floor be granted to my first session summer interns Amanda Edgar, Grace Kolean, Jeffry Alsup, Rhiannon Dobbins, Wesley Hulbert, Selby Long, Brooke Markoff, Mia Parish, Karley Thrun, Drake Ward, Braxton Zine, and Vanessa Auth and to my Senate Committee on Indian Affairs interns Elmore Limberhand, Julia King, and Austin West for the month of June 2025 in the 119th Congress."
"Last year, Dr Mohammed Mohsen was offered a position in the acute medicine department at Royal Cornwall hospital in my constituency. He was due to start that role last year, but due to the ongoing conflict and travel restrictions in Gaza, he has been unable to travel to the UK. Would the Minister meet me to consider his case, as he requires urgent assistance?"
"As well as energy, water is an important utility. In Ely and East Cambridgeshire, we suffer drought and floods. What is the Minister doing to encourage new builds to have proper rainwater harvesting and dual piping, so that we can use rainwater to flush our toilets and for other non-drinking water uses?"
"Mr. Speaker, Canadians elected a new government to build a strong Canada and to protect programs that serve families. Families are strong when kids are healthy. Our national school meal program is delivering meals to hundreds of thousands of kids this year. It saves parents up to $800 per year. We are committed to making this permanent. We made this commitment in the campaign, and I call on the member opposite to support us."
"Mr. Chair, again, we are here to talk about transport and internal trade-related issues. I am delighted to answer questions about those. I do—"
I notice that that was an exclusive invitation just to the Minister.
"We of course want to ensure that all families that are eligible for this roll-out benefit from it. Working with other Government Departments, we want to make the process as simple as possible. We are  determined to bring down child poverty. We appreciate that the issues are complex, and we want to get this right. We will set out more details in due course."
"Mr. Speaker, timing seems to be everything. The Liberal government tried to get ahead of it. It announced Friday, just before it was going to be caught with its pants down, that it would be banning GC Strategies, but it probably already had advance notice of what it would be doing. Dealing with GC Strategies needed to be brought forward right now. This is one of the audit reports. It was only one of nine. There are a lot of other damning issues that we need to address, but this is just the beginning. It is a start with regard to that one audit report."
"Schools with a smartphone ban were rated higher by Ofsted, and their students achieved better GCSE results. All the evidence shows the benefit of banning smartphones in schools, but the Government are simply issuing non-statutory guidance and passing the buck. Does the Minister not understand the evidence? Does he need more evidence, or does he not trust the Government to be able to implement a ban on smartphones in schools?"
"I am well aware of the hon. Gentleman's campaign to support young adults who lack mental capacity in accessing their child trust fund. I know that he met my predecessor, and following work that I am carrying out with counterparts in other Departments, I will be very pleased to meet him."
"I rise today to recognize the outstanding contributions that Tom Prior has made in our community through his volunteerism at the Good Samaritan Clinic in Pasco County since 2014. Tom began volunteering in the clinic's pharmacy and quickly became one of the clinic's Eligibility and Referral Specialists. Tom reviews the applications for the clinic's new and requalifying patients, assuring that patients meet the income and residency requirements necessary to receive free medical care. Tom always treats all potential patients with respect and dignity. He is an inspiration to the staff and his fellow volunteers. Tom volunteers at the clinic two to three times a week for eight months out of the year. Tom always goes above and beyond, always putting the patients' well-being first. Tom is also a loyal supporter of Metropolitan Ministries in Holiday, where he donates food and other needed supplies to their program. Pasco County is a better place because of dedicated, caring volunteers like, Tom Prior. It is clear Tom Prior has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility."
I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.
"I am not giving way. [Interruption.] The hon. Lady has spoken for many hours; I am speaking for five minutes. The experience of Roger Foley, a Canadian living with a degenerative condition, warns us: ""As Canada has expanded its assisted dying law, I have faced neglect, verbal abuse, and denial of essential care. I've been told my care needs are too much work, and my life has been devalued. Worse still, I have been approached and told by healthcare staff to consider opting for Medical Aid in Dying. Instead of offering compassionate support to alleviate my suffering, it is suggested...that I should end my life."" Sadly, this is not the only example we have heard of this; we have also heard of veterans with post-traumatic stress order and others with limiting conditions. Today, sadly, we have even said that those who merely feel pressure are allowed to access this service. Members have a real choice today. When that first 18 or 19-year-old--that first individual--goes and asks for this, it will be we who made that decision. It will be on our consciences. It will be a decision that has fundamentally changed the relationship between the individual and the state in a way that can never be reversed."
"Mr. Speaker, extortion is up 357%. Earlier this week, an Abbotsford man was gunned down because of extortion. Following his death, there was another extortion-related shooting in the area. Yesterday, in B.C.'s Lower Mainland, another home was shot at. Thankfully, this time no one was injured. Every neighbourhood is terrified and innocent lives are on the line. The Liberals eliminated mandatory minimums for extortion with a firearm. How many more lives must be taken by extortion before the Liberals put a minimum sentence back on extortion?"
"Mr. Speaker, the member knows full well that, currently, border officers have the ability and authority to inspect rail cars carrying imported goods. Bill C-2 now includes an additional power, the power to inspect rail cars carrying goods destined for export. How will officers do that, though? Currently, even though they are empowered to inspect rail cars containing imported goods, they do it rarely, if at all, because they are short-staffed. How can they be given additional powers when they are unable to fully assume their role of examining and inspecting rail cars carrying exports and imports?"
"I am grateful to have my first opportunity to contribute on this Bill. It would not be appropriate to dilate on my profound anxieties about it, but I approach these amendments in the spirit of constructive engagement. I rise to speak to linked amendments 82 to 86, which would strengthen the panel by giving it some of the features of the High Court safeguard that was, regrettably, removed. We heard from the hon. Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater) that the panel will now be stronger because it includes a broader range of expertise. The argument against that, of course, is that the High Court was a stronger safeguard because it has the powers of a court and the independence of the judiciary. My amendments would mean that we do not have to choose between the two: the panel is part of the Bill, but we can have a better panel if we give it some of the features of the High Court, namely its independence, the calibre of its judges, and its powers as a court. Amendment 82 would require all panel members to be appointed by the Judicial Appointments Commission, which nominates judges in England and Wales. Currently, the selection of panel members is wholly down to the voluntary assisted dying commissioner. Schedule 2 says: ""The Commissioner must make appointments to a list of persons eligible to sit as members of panels."" I have absolutely no doubt that the commissioner will be someone of great integrity and experience, but he or she will certainly be a strong advocate of assisted dying, as will those who put themselves forward for the panels. That may create an impression that the VAD commission is a self-selecting group with a particular set of institutional views. If the system is to command public confidence, I believe that appointments would be best administered by an external body, and the Judicial Appointments Commission is the obvious choice. We in this country trust the judiciary, partly because we know that they represent no set of opinions."
"My hon. Friend is right to raise the appalling case in his constituency, where seven people were convicted on Friday. He will also know that further criminal investigations are still ongoing--it is shameful how long it has taken to get justice for those victims. I agree with him that no one can hide from justice on this appalling issue, on which victims and survivors have been let down for far too long. I hope that supporting that aim will be a cross-party process."
"Mr. Chair, this government supports the development of the nuclear energy industry in this country. It is clean energy. It will help us deliver on being an energy superpower. That is what we are committed to doing, and that is why we are passing the one Canadian economy act."
"Mr. Speaker, Canadians want to see us working together, and I am going to say that this applies to the members across the way. They want to see us meet this moment when we are facing the challenges from President Trump. I hope they are willing to help us."
"I thank my hon. Friend for introducing this debate. She has mentioned several women whom I know personally, having worked with them, and she is absolutely right that they are incredible. I particularly send my sympathy to Lynn and her family. We know that barriers to improving breast cancer screening rates include not only awareness but accessibility; it is about people living in rural areas being able to get to where treatment and screening can take place. Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government need to think not only about treatment but about the way in which people access that treatment when they are in rural areas like mine and hers?"
"I rise to honor Dr. Rose M.Z. Gowen for 16 noble years of public service as City Commissioner At-Large ``B'' for the City of Brownsville, Texas. Dr. Gowen was elected in 2009 and has served in office since then. In her time as City Commissioner, she has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to public health and improving the quality of life for all the residents of Brownsville. Dr. Gowen's dedication to promoting healthy lifestyles in our community has not gone unnoticed. Her work has led to many programs which have proven beneficial to the health and wellbeing of our community. These programs include the establishment of the Brownville Farmers' Market and the CycloBia event, which provide nutritious food and exercise through cycling, respectively. In addition, Dr. Gowen also spearheaded the RGV Challenge, an annual 12-week health initiative which has encouraged massive community change in health and wellness. This in addition to her leadership in advocating for sustainable infrastructure such as the Carcara Trails, which is nearly 430 miles of outdoor trails connecting communities across South Texas. All these projects highlight Dr. Gowen's loyal commitment to the betterment of our community. Brownsville is lucky to have public servants who display this level of dedication and drive to create positive change in our region. I am proud to represent communities like Brownsville and the wonderful public servants who continue to make it a better place to live. Mr. Speaker, I wish to congratulate Dr. Rose Gowen for celebrating 16 years of public service."
"Mr. Chair, we will stand by the affordability definitions as they have been applied, but the focus with “build Canada homes” going forward is going to be on doubling the amount of affordable housing. We have heard the Prime Minister speak very clearly about the need to focus that funding on solving homelessness, and the most vulnerable in our population will need that support. Members on this side of the House—"
"I include in the Record the following newsletter to give an update to my constituents on the town hall:  Dear Friend, Recently, I held my ninth in-person town hall in Asheville. Hearing from the people of Western North Carolina will continue to be a priority of mine, and I will not shy away from my support of President Trump and our important work renewing the American Dream and fixing how Washington works. President Trump is doing exactly what he promised to do: comb through our federal agencies to look for inefficiencies. I applaud the fact that he's doing that, and I appreciate his recognition that I went all 12 rounds to support and defend the America First agenda. Despite some disruptions, I was able to answer questions from multiple constituents at the town hall and dispel some of the misinformation currently being spread around,     such as about the House's budget plan and DOGE, and I look forward to continuing to do as such. Being accessible, listening, and answering questions for our mountain folk are among my favorite activities, which is why my office provides several avenues of engagement for constituents: Stay updated on upcoming in-person and telephone town halls by following me on Facebook and visiting my website at edwards.house.gov/events. Folks can request a one-on-one Chat With Chuck meeting by visiting edwards.house.gov/chatwithchuck. Stop by Carolina Cruiser mobile office hours to ask questions about issues that matter to you or receive assistance with federal agencies, such as FEMA. The schedule is available on Facebook and X, and at edwards.house.gov/carolinacruiser. With my warmest regards, Chuck Edwards, Member of Congress."
"Mr. Speaker, the Speech from the Throne announced that the time frames for launching major federal projects would be shortened. I am very worried about the environment. I am especially worried about one thing in particular. Will the government commit to respecting the findings of the Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement regarding oil projects and other such things?"
"Mr. Scott admitted before the Finance Committee that he signed the illegal subpoena and expressed no remorse for his actions. He appears so unfazed by these allegations of brazen lawlessness that it seems inevitable he will sanction similar abuses of power if he is confirmed to lead Customs and Border Protection. Since Donald Trump took office, on far too many occasions, CBP has shown contempt for the constitutional rights of Americans. For example, in Texas, a 10-year-old U.S. citizen was left in Mexico with her family after being stopped by CBP on her way to a doctor's appointment for brain cancer treatment. In Washington, CBP detained a family of six, including a pregnant mother who was still breastfeeding her baby, a U.S. citizen. CBP held them in a windowless cell for 24 days. They had no access to due process or ability to contest their detention. In Arizona, a 19-year-old U.S. citizen with intellectual disabilities, who has difficulty speaking, writing, and reading, was arrested by CBP and charged with illegal entry, despite being an American. CBP kept him detained for 10 days. There are countless gut-wrenching stories like this. Courts have already raised concerns about CBP's inability to uphold the Constitution. I am of the view that America needs strong enforcement at the border to protect our people against criminals and drug traffickers, but that does not have to come at the expense of violating Americans' constitutional rights. Our country does not need a border Agency that indiscriminately violates the rights of Americans or one that feels like it is above due process and above the law. That doesn't make our country safer. It only leads to corruption, more wrongful arrests, and more wrongful deaths. Americans do not need to choose between security and our rights. We can have both, just as Ben Franklin said many years ago. I fear that confirming Mr. Scott would make our country less secure and less free. For that reason, I strongly oppose this nomination. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
"Mr. Chair, the minister has increased, through the estimates, the budget for contractors by $7 billion. My question related specifically to the contracting practices of the Liberal government as it pertains to arrive scam. How much money has been recovered to date? Is the number zero?"
"Mr. Chair, I think that is a question for the Minister of Jobs and Families ."
"I thought this evening that I might appraise the House of the story of Pat and John Hirst from my constituency. Pat was a nurse. She qualified in 1975 at Leeds general infirmary, and the following year she met John while studying in Liverpool. They married in 1978, raised their three sons and settled in Stockton. Pat returned to work after she had had her children, initially in nursing homes, caring for residents with dementia, then later at the University hospital of North Tees, where she worked for more than a decade. In the final months of Pat's time at the hospital, her performance as a nurse began to decline. Unbeknownst to her colleagues or her family, Pat was displaying the early symptoms of frontotemporal dementia, which we heard about earlier from the hon. Member for South Devon (Caroline Voaden). Pat's colleagues did not realise that, so disciplinary action was initiated. John believes that Pat would have been dismissed, but she instead decided to retire on her 60th birthday, before the end of that year. In early 2012, Pat experienced swallowing difficulties. She underwent tests across several hospitals, and the diagnosis came. No further explanation was provided, other than a referral to the local memory clinic--an experience of many people with dementia. That evening, John sat at his computer and searched online for more information. There, alone in his own home, he learned that the average life expectancy from diagnosis was between two and 20 years. He had not realised until that point that dementia could be a terminal illness. I think we can all agree that there must be a better way of finding out such devastating news. Pat remained aware of her surroundings and her loved ones until the very end. In her final two years, she lost the ability to speak and could communicate only with her eyes. John recalls the look of fear in her eyes when it became clear that end of life care was beginning. At that point, she was fully aware that she was saying goodbye to her husband and her sons. Their grandson Henry is now two years old. He will never know his granny, but John is determined that Henry and others of his generation should grow up in a world where dementia can be diagnosed early, managed better and ultimately cured. John now volunteers with Alzheimer's Research UK, and he recently completed a walk from Teesside to Newcastle to raise awareness and funding. For those not familiar with the area, that is quite a long distance. Even walking, he got there faster than he would have done on the Durham coast line. In Stockton, we have about 1,300 people suffering from dementia, but it takes six weeks longer for a dementia diagnosis in my constituency than the national average. We clearly need to ensure that people are diagnosed early before symptoms become apparent, but it is also important that we raise awareness with the public and employers that early-onset dementia can and does affect people before retirement age, so that people do not suffer the kind of treatment that Pat did in her last year of employment. While the impact of dementia is a difficulty for a parent, it adds a new dimension when that person is diagnosed at the age of 30 or 40. We have heard already that if nothing changes, one in two of us will be affected  by dementia, whether individually, living as a carer or both. John speaks not only for himself and for Pat, but for the thousands of families across Stockton North and the country who are facing this condition. We owe it to John and to other families to ensure that the experience of dementia is no longer defined by lengthy waits, lack of information and financial hardship or, indeed, improved by people like John walking long distances from Teesside to Newcastle. Instead, it should be defined by early intervention, compassionate care, and meaningful progress through research."
"Mr. Chair, I know he is anxious. It is going to come in the fall, and it is going to be great. We just have to be a bit patient, but it is going to be great. He is going to like it. I see it in his face."
"Mr. Speaker, the federal government will determine whether a major project is in the national interest based on consultation with the provinces, territories and indigenous people. Projects selected will also be subject to comprehensive consultation with indigenous people. For all projects, the Crown, including the provinces and territories, must consult indigenous people. That is what the government is going to do."
"I gently say to my hon. Friend that the Mayor of the West Midlands might have something to say about his great city being seen as the end of an extension to the London underground line. It is completely right that our two great cities--Birmingham and London--are connected with high-quality rail services. Although this is a difficult day in exposing the state of the project, I have no doubt that in time it will be a railway we can be proud of. I also say to my hon. Friend that I am aware of forecast capacity constraints between Birmingham and Manchester and in other parts of the country. We are investing, through things such as the trans-Pennine route upgrade, in improving connectivity to other great cities in the north of England. We are determined to  ensure that everyone, no matter where they live in the country, has an excellent public transport system that they can rely upon."
"Mr. Speaker, it has been four years since we lost the Afzaal family, Madiha, Salman, Talat and Yumnah, in a horrific Islamophobic attack that left a nine-year-old orphaned and a community devastated. This was not just a hate crime; it was terrorism, driven by Islamophobia and targeted hate. More and more, we are experiencing violent hate in Canada that breaks hearts, steals lives and impedes our collective identity. We need to do better. We remember the Afzaal family not just for how their lives ended but for how they lived, with love and with hope for a strong future. Tomorrow, as families gather to celebrate Eid al-Adha, we are reminded that they should be here too, celebrating and surrounded by loved ones. We owe it to them, and to everyone who has ever felt unsafe because of their identity, to do better, to protect Canadians against hate. Their lives mattered; their stories matter. We will remember, and we will act."
"I agree with my hon. Friend that it would absolutely help our deterrence if we could increase troop numbers. The Liberal Democrats are calling for new bonus schemes to recruit and re-enlist 3,000 personnel, allowing the Government to reach their target of 73,000 trained troops as soon as possible, meaning that they  can grow Army numbers further and faster beyond that in this Parliament. I encourage the Minister to consider those proposals."
"I will not be the only person in this place who has lost someone they loved to suicide. In listening to what has been said recently by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which is not opposed to the Bill in principle, the penny dropped for many of us that many people given a terminal diagnosis will have mental health issues that come with that. How does the hon. Member think we can distinguish between a person who chooses to end their own life because of a mental health issue caused by despair from having a terminal illness and somebody who wants to end their life because of despair caused by something else? Does that not blur our approach to the importance and sanctity of life and to preventing suicide in every circumstance?"
"The Minister is rightly pointing out where progress has been made nationally and internationally, but when he was cantering through those points of light nationally, he missed out one group: the men and women serving in our armed forces. I am particularly mindful of that because Saturday is Armed Forces Day and, sadly, one of the chief advocates for LGBT people in the armed forces, Lord Etherton, died in May. Will the Minister pay tribute to Terence Etherton and comment on his 2023 report into the shameful way in which gay people were treated in the armed forces between 1967 and 2000?"
"Will the Prime Minister join me in condemning decisions taken by the Transport Minister of the previous Government, who turned their back on promises to deliver a new train station at Beam Park, which derailed growth in my constituency of Dagenham and Rainham? Will he also agree that the Grampian condition on the Beam Park development must be honoured, and that infrastructure must accompany all developments of scale as we get on with the job of delivering millions of new homes?"
"I am just coming to my conclusion. The choice for Members is very clear--indeed, stark. It is to approve the biggest change to abortion law in 58 years while, I believe, making things worse for women and their unborn children, or to solve the problem of criminal justice overreach by reinstating in-person appointments for abortion. This is clearly a very difficult subject, and I just feel that amending this Bill is not the right way to go about such a divisive and emotive change, but I will leave it there."
I would remind the hon. member that I have absolutely no members.
"Mr. Chair, the housing accelerator fund has invested $4.4 billion to eliminate the barriers to development and build homes faster."
"New Hope Care, a private company owned by Patrick Cheza, was operating in my constituency of Stockport. It failed its staff and exploited vulnerable workers, some of whom were migrant workers who feared speaking out about their mistreatment and neglect, worried that it could impact their visa status. Regardless of their immigration status, people should be compensated for their work. My office has more than 20 cases on this issue. I am told that the company has received payment on its contracts, including from Stockport council and customers, yet it is withholding vital wages from its staff. Many of them have not been paid for four or five months and are experiencing significant financial hardship. It is my understanding that the owners are based abroad. Will the Leader of the House allow a debate in Government time on enforcing compliance from private social care providers, such as New Hope Care, that fail to pay wages?"
I must interrupt the hon. member to give the member for Repentigny a chance to answer the question.
"Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to congratulate my colleague on his re-election and on the kind words he had for his family. We just want to know why his party did not support our efforts to abolish the tax."
"Certainly, there will be great opportunities for young people, both in the youth experience scheme and in associating with Erasmus+. I too welcome the cross-party consensus--even the shadow Minister, the hon. Member for Kingswinford and South Staffordshire (Mike Wood), backed the youth experience scheme in the debate a couple of weeks ago."
Time has elapsed for questions. The next member is the member for Abbotsford—South Langley.
"Mr. Speaker, I ask that it be carried on division."
"This is the latest national scandal to arise in our attempts to bring in infrastructure schemes on budget and on time, but the taxpayer is not the only victim of the failure of this project so far; there are also the people of the north of England. HS2 was originally a scheme intended to help the economies of the north-west and Yorkshire and those communities on the way, so there is a complete failure there. What we will be left with is an extension to the London underground system, and that will not help people in Leeds, Bradford, Manchester, Sheffield and elsewhere. Will the Secretary of State consider safeguarding the original routes so that when we get our infrastructure plans in place, we can build something that this country can be proud of?"
"I rise tonight in our moral moment in our Nation. As we debate this bill, so much is on the line. The healthcare of over 16 million Americans--750,000 of them Georgians--is on the line. Food for hungry children in a wealthy nation, where one in five children are already food insecure. They don't know where their next meal is coming from. Their livelihood, their welfare is on the line. The well-being of seniors in nursing homes and the disabled who rely on Medicaid and those who care for them is on the line. The fate of rural hospitals in Georgia, in Alaska, in Louisiana, in little towns all over this Nation that are right now barely hanging on is on the line. And the scraps that they are throwing them, while cutting them, will not save them. And my friends on the other side of the aisle know it. They know that these scraps that they are throwing at rural hospitals will not save them. And so in a very real sense, lives are on the line. We are in a moral moment because something else is on the line. I submit that the character of the country is on the line. In a real sense, the question tonight is, Who are we? Not who we tell ourselves we are, but who are we really? What and who do we care about? What kind of nation are we? And what kind of people do we want to be? Who matters, and who doesn't? Who do we think is dispensable? And no place is the answer to that question clearer than in a nation's budget. I submit that a budget is not just a fiscal document; a budget is a moral document. Show me your budget, and I will show you who you think matters and who doesn't. And if this awful budget were an EKG, it would suggest that our Nation has a heart problem and is in need of moral surgery. And so I am clear tonight. I understand the nature of what we are engaged in. This is a political process; it is. But it is also a moral exercise, not only for the Nation but for each of us individually, and especially for the mere 100 of us out of a nation of 300 million who get to vote, perhaps in a matter of hours. We have the rare privilege of standing up for people who have entrusted with us the covenant of centering their families. It is a real privilege for the people of your State to say that since we can't all go to Washington, we are going to trust you in rooms of power to be thinking about our children, to be thinking about our parents as they deal with the blessings and the burdens of growing old. And so the question for me tonight is, How will we will show up in this moment? And that is why yesterday I gathered in the Russell rotunda with a multifaith coalition of clergy to pray that lawmakers might have the courage to stand up to their party, to stand up to the special interests, and protect seniors in nursing homes and pregnant mothers on Medicaid and children who risk going to school hungry every single day in this country. One in five children in the wealthiest Nation on the planet are already food insecure. And with these SNAP cuts, this body is about to make it worse. And so surrounded by clergy of many faith traditions, yesterday, I prayed that we would have the courage and I prayed that we would have the grace to stand as voices for the voiceless. And as I stood there, I could not help but feel a sense of deja vu. This is not the first time I have been in our Nation's Capital speaking out against these policies that betray hard-working families. It was 8 years ago almost to the day in 2017 when Washington Republicans were trying to pass a tax bill that favored wealthy Americans over working families that I came to this building, not as a Senator but as a pastor. I had no idea that 8 years later I would be serving in this body. I had no notion that I would even run for the Senate. I came as a citizen. And standing with a multifaith coalition, we were praying for our Nation's leaders, and we were gathered in the rotunda of the Russell Building. And, as we were singing and praying, the Capitol Police said: I am sorry, pastors. You can't sing and pray in the rotunda. If you do not disperse, we will have to arrest you. And let me say that the Capitol Police did not mishandle us that day. They were first-rate professionals. But they said that if you don't disperse, we will have to arrest you. What they didn't understand is that I had already been arrested. My conscience had been arrested. My heart and my imagination--my moral imagination--had been arrested by this idea that we, as a country, are better than this. I come from a tradition where you don't just pray with your lips; you pray with your legs. You put your body in the struggle for other struggling bodies. And so here I am tonight, 8 years later, having transformed my agitation into legislation. I was arrested that day, but I have transformed my protest into public policy. Eight years ago, I was on the outside. Tonight, I am on the inside, but it is the same fight.  Some of us fight on the inside; some of us fight on the outside. Some of us get to serve in the Senate or in the House; others are just watching at home tonight. But be really clear that we are in the same fight, whether we are on the streets or in the suites--same fight. In some ways, this is the same bill 8 years later, just worse. Like most horror movies, the sequel tends to be worse. When we were here 8 years ago, Washington politicians were trying their best to gut the Affordable Care Act. Remember that? When we were here, they were trying to gut ObamaCare out of political motives. Millions of Americans were spared, but tonight is the sequel to that horror movie. They are back to their old political tricks, trying to dismantle the ACA again with this legislation. It is the same fight, just worse this time. Instead of extending tax credits that would lower health insurance costs for the middle class, my friends on the other side are giving billionaires and the richest of the rich a tax cut. They are working real hard tonight to help billionaires because, God knows, they are having a hard time, apparently. What that means is that 1.2 million Georgians and nearly 20 million Americans are going to see their healthcare premiums rise. That is what is at stake tonight. If they enact these deep cuts to Medicaid, as they are positioned not to extend these premiums, these tax credits, they are raising the cost ofhealthcare for all of us. Even if you are on private insurance, you are not safe. Your healthcare is about to go up. Your hospital might close. And because they are cutting these clean energy tax cuts, your utility bills are about to go up. So I have a question tonight. Who voted for that? Some of us are Democrats. Some of us are Republicans. Some of us are Independents. Some voted for one party; some voted for the other party. I get it. But who voted for that? Who voted for everybody's healthcare premiums to go up and their hospitals to close? Here is what I know. The folks back in Georgia didn't vote for that. They voted for me, and they voted for Donald Trump, but they didn't vote for that. Ordinary folks don't want this. Just ordinary, everyday people who barely pay attention to politics, they don't want this. Even a FOX News poll--and you won't often hear me say that--but even a FOX News poll from this month found that Americans don't support this ``Big Ugly Bill.'' This is systemic in the ways in which the people's voices have been squeezed out of their democracy. This is not just a healthcare fight, it is that. It is not just a fight for food security for SNAP, it is that. But in the real sense, it is a fight for our democracy. Whose voice gets to be heard in this Chamber? That is what this is about, the character of the country. Ordinary Americans don't want to do this to our children. That is why they need to know that 71 percent of all Medicaid enrollees in Georgia are children--71 percent. They are taking away healthcare from kids to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. Let me be clear. I am all for tax cuts. I believe working families deserve a tax cut, and I certainly don't want to see them face a tax hike this year. That is why I want to nearly double the child tax credit. I believe in tax cuts for hard-working families, for middle- class people, for working-class families. Instead of doing that, instead of helping working-class families who are struggling now against a 10-percent tax on everything and rising costs, we are now burdening our children by adding $3 trillion to the debt. We are taking away healthcare from kids and then burdening them with the debt. We are engaged in Robin Hood in reverse, this body, of stealing from the poor in order to give to the rich; this massive transfer of wealth from the bottom to the top. This is socialism for the rich. And when the people hear about it, guess what. They don't like it-- Democrats and Republicans and Independents. When the people hear about what is in this ``Big Ugly Bill,'' they don't like it. And that is why the folks on the other side are trying their best to fast-track it. That is why they are trying to pass it, and they haven't even finished writing it. They are twisting themselves in knots, making their Members walk the plank under the threat of a primary to pass this ``Big Ugly Bill.'' The American people do not want to rob our children of food and healthcare and then burden them with trillions in debt to give billionaires and wealthy corporations another tax cut. The people do not want this bill. So if the people do not want this bill, but they are trying to pass it, here is the question that you have to ask yourselves at home. You have to ask yourselves: Well, whom are they working for? Whom are they fighting for? Who do they think matters? Do you think they are working for you? This is a moral moment and a budget is a moral document. We have been summoned to this moment, people of faith and people of moral courage who claim no particular faith at all. Maybe because I was here yesterday and 8 years ago for a similar fight with faith leaders; maybe because I am a preacher and it is Sunday and I have been here instead of church, I have especially been thinking about those of us who are people of faith, people whose lives are informed by Scripture, people of the Book. And maybe those of us who have different politics but read from the same Book ought to spend some time together reading the Book because I do sometimes wonder--and I say this with all humility. None of us owns the truth. But if I am honest, there are days when I have to ask people of my faith tradition as a Christian, are we reading the same Book? The Book I know says: I was hungry and you fed me. I was sick, I was in prison, and you visited me. I was a stranger and you welcomed me. In as much as you have done it to the least of these, you have done it unto me. The Book that I love says: Learn to do good, seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for the widow. Speak out for those who cannot speak, for the rights of the destitute. Speak out, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and the needy. My Book says: Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the Lord and will be repaid in full. The prophet Amos condemns those who ``buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals.'' They sell the poor out and working-class people for cheap. And for those of us who have a vote in this moment, for my colleagues who are swinging on a moral dilemma, I hear the prophet Micah say: He has already told you what is good. What does the Lord require of you but that you do justice, love kindness, and walk humbly with your God. May God be with our Nation and grant us grace, wisdom, and courage for this moment. I yield the floor."
"Mr. Speaker, Bill C-5 , as it currently stands, would allow the federal government to say that it will consult Quebec, for example. Quebec says no, it does not want a pipeline project within its borders. However, there is absolutely nothing in Bill C‑5 to indicate that a consensus or Quebec's approval would be required before a pipeline could be built. Is the member aware of this reality? Does he agree that the provinces should have the final say on projects located within their borders?"
"Let me squash the hon. Gentleman's last comment, which is wrong: we do not have to inform Mauritius before taking any military action. Under the treaty, we have to provide notification after the event. I have explained this 13 times in written answers to Members on the Conservative Front Bench, but I am afraid that they still do not get it. That underlines why they could not do a deal after 11 rounds of negotiation, whereas this Government did it after two rounds, securing the future of that vital base for UK and US operations."
"Mr. Chair, I will be going ten minutes and five minutes, just for the record. I believe the Prime Minister truly understands the economics of immigration. It is really encouraging, whether it is in the throne speech or the mandate letters, the degree that he incorporates the idea of sustainable immigration levels. That is not a new term to me; in fact, during the nineties, I often talked about it inside the Manitoba legislature. To get an appreciation of the value of immigration, something that I do not believe the Conservatives understand, is to take a look at the overall numbers and figure out what is in the best interest of the country, making sure to get that mix correct. For example, if we take a look back at the history of Manitoba during the nineties, when I was an MLA, going into the 2000, 2006-07 era, we see that immigration changed a great deal. In the early nineties, our average numbers were probably somewhere in the neighbourhood of 3,000 to 3,500, give or take a few hundred. For many of us, that was too low. We wanted to see more immigrants coming to the province of Manitoba. In fact, it made our population somewhat stagnant until Jean Chrétien and Gary Filmon came to the table with the provincial nominee program. That has been an economic gold mine for the province of Manitoba. It is a program that I am very passionate about. Manitoba needs the nominee program and is very much reliant on it. Through that particular program, what we saw was that for the first time, Manitoba's numbers actually increased, and increased quite dramatically. Back in the nineties, I was suggesting that we should have somewhere in the neighbourhood of 1% of our provincial population from immigration, figuring that if we were to get the mixture right, it is a sustainable immigration number. That is what we were able to achieve because we used the nominee program as an economic driver, which then complemented the other streams that the federal government had in place. As a direct result of being able to manage that program, having that agreement between Canada and Manitoba, we were able to enhance our immigration numbers. If it were not for that nominee program, arguably, Manitoba's population would be nowhere near what it is today. In fact, some would argue that we could have lost our population. When I listened to the Conservatives across the way during the first series of questions they asked, and I would invite people to read what they were asking, they did come across as very anti-immigrant. That concerns me because it was immigrants who helped build this country we have today. Taking a look at the last 20 to 30 years in the province of Manitoba, we have seen the substantial growth of our Filipino-heritage community, our Punjabi-heritage community and others, but those two have led the way. We can take a look at health care, which was being discussed a great deal, or our manufacturing industry or the new entrepreneurs who are opening up, developing and building homes. I think we do need to be sensitive to the different regions, different provinces and rural versus urban. It is important to recognize that temporary immigrants play a critical role in food security. We need to have temporary visas that enable individuals to come and help us out in our rural communities so that we can provide the type of food we are providing, not only locally but to the world. If we really want to get into the discussion about immigration, there are far more positives than negatives. When we think of the situation we are in today, we have to factor in the circumstances that brought us to this point. Whether it was the pandemic that ultimately led to more temporary workers, or the drive from universities and provinces in different regions of the country demanding more temporary residents, there is a reason it has taken place in the manner it has. The system is not broken. Yes, we need to take actions to make sure we can continue in a sustainable way. As the Prime Minister has said, it is about having an immigration level that is sustainable and making sure we get the mixture right. We need to be sensitive about our rural communities that need those temporary workers. We need to be sensitive to those post-secondary institutions that are, often, trying to build a world reputation on the type of education that is provided in these facilities. I recognize there was also a lot of abuse in that area. There are things we can learn. We need to work with provinces in a closer fashion. We need to recognize that there are some issues that need to be dealt with. However, to paint with one brush and to say this is an action that has to be taken, and it is universally applied across the nation, I do not think is fair. Instead, I believe we should establish goals, as the Minister of Immigration has done. I do not know how many times she has said that we have these goals and we are moving towards these goals. I think that is a responsible approach. It complements what the Prime Minister is saying, and I will repeat it again:sustainable immigration levels. We know we have many immigrants here who are permanent residents who will marry a spouse abroad, Canadian citizens who find partners from outside of Canada. This is a very important category, and we have to continue to allow those individuals to come to our country as permanent residents. We have to continue to allow temporary workers to come, to deal with those issues such as in our agricultural communities. I would like to hear some of the rural Conservatives stand in their place and say, “No, do not allow any temporary workers to come to Canada.” Do members know the damage that would do to our economy? Immigration is there, if we can get a hold and have sustainable immigration levels, to complement our economy, to build Canada into a stronger, healthier economy. Whether it is the Prime Minister or the Minister of Immigration , both of them understand that. Both of them understand that we have goals that have to be met, and in certain situations, it can be very difficult. Let us remember, when the Conservatives make these demands, that there is a face on the other side of that particular demand. We need to be sympathetic and compassionate in recognizing that. I would like to believe that through the years, as we have built a very strong nation, immigration has played a critical role. The minister has been in there, I think, three, four weeks to date, and I have appreciated the discussions we have had. I appreciate the fact that she has been putting in the time and energy to make sure we establish those goals and work towards achieving those goals. If I were to ask the minister a question, it would be on the importance of recognizing that a sustainable immigration level, as the Prime Minister has said, plays a critical role in building a stronger and healthier country. Can she provide her thoughts on how important it is that we achieve that?"
"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to speak. I thank, too, my hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall and Camberwell Green (Florence Eshalomi) for bringing forward this debate, and for her excellent chairmanship of the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee, which is evident from the contributions from across the House. I am here to speak not only about how construction and building homes will help to create hundreds of thousands of good jobs, but about how we need to create millions more if we want everyone here to live a decent life. I am an economist, and I came to this place to ensure that everybody could earn a decent living and have enough money to pay the bills, but we are so far from that today. The average salary for a non-graduate is around PS30,000. For two earners to raise two kids, they need to earn PS35,000 each, but around 40% of full-time jobs pay less than that. That is 10 million workers who cannot afford a decent life, and those who cannot earn enough are turning away from Labour Members, as they have turned away from Conservative Members. If we want everyone to have a decent job, the Government must help to create them. We are making a good start with house building. I welcome the PS500 million that is going into affordable house building this year, and the PS40 billion for the 10 years to come, because construction jobs are good non-graduate jobs. Building those 1.5 million homes means creating good jobs. A skilled construction worker earns PS35,000. Around 300,000 of those jobs will be created when we build 1.5 million homes, and another 300,000 more jobs will be created in decarbonising buildings. That is welcome, but we need to create a lot more good jobs if we want everyone to live a decent life. We need millions more--a lot more than the 600,000 jobs that will be created in the construction of homes and insulation.  This is a job far bigger than housing and local government alone. Good jobs in healthcare, childcare and social care are all needed. That is the path we should follow--the Government should create good jobs. We should not simply wish that enough good jobs will be created--that is the path we should not follow. In our technological era, growth alone does not automatically create enough good jobs where we need them, either for the people or places that require them. We came to this place to create a better life for all, but that is not possible for almost half of all workers because there are not enough good jobs. We can create hundreds of thousands of good jobs through construction, but we need to create millions more if we want everyone in this country to live a good life."
"Mr. Chair, when immigration documents expire, individuals are expected to leave the country, and those who do not comply, public safety—"
"Immigration centres are not used for indefinite detention. We can only keep anyone in detention in an immigration centre if there is a reasonable prospect of their removal. If there is not, they have to be released."
"The hon. Member raises the timescale. In the discussions we have had with Baroness Casey, and recognising the many issues that people want to raise in the inquiry, we had expected that it would take around three years, but if the commission is able to work faster than that, people will clearly want answers as swiftly as possible. The final details about the timings are obviously to be determined. We need to make sure both that we are implementing the recommendations of previous inquiries and that we are pursuing further the investigations in local areas as swiftly as possible. I reiterated in my statement a recognition of the huge harm that has been done to victims and survivors through the decades. I would urge the hon. Member to look at the 17-page section of Louise Casey's report on the failure, year after year, to follow through and take action, and I do believe that victims and survivors are owed an apology for that failure over very many years."
"Mr. Speaker, I want to give credit where credit is due to Doug Ford. Maybe my hon. friend should call him someday. We talk to him regularly, and he has put in place a bill that ensures there is reciprocity for any province that wants to pick up the challenge of these barriers to working. Doug Ford will tell the member if he calls him that the work has been done."
"There are 300 more people on out-of-work benefits in Basildon and Billericay than there were 12 months ago. Local businesses tell me that that is because business rates have gone up under the Labour Government, national insurance tax has gone up under the Labour Government and taxes on investment for the long term have gone up under the Labour Government. Does the Minister agree, or has she got another explanation for the fact that 300 more of my constituents are unemployed than there were 12 months ago?"
"I rise today to recognize Dr. Jim Hotz, a Georgia resident who has dedicated 47 years to providing medical care to those in rural communities. When Dr. Hotz began practicing in Leesburg, Georgia, he was not only the only doctor in the county but the first they had seen in nearly 40 years. Shocked to see so many people suffering from diseases no longer considered to be a widespread threat, such as tuberculosis, Dr. Hotz made it his mission to remedy the lack of accessible medical care that plagued rural Georgia. From snake bites to cervical cancer, Dr. Hotz treated thousands of patients who otherwise would have been forced to commute across counties for treatment, a trip that could cost them their lives. In addition to nearly 50 years of medical service, Dr. Hotz founded Albany Area Primary Health Care to assist rural communities in obtaining accessible healthcare. Mr. Speaker, Dr. Hotz represents the best of compassion and community service, and it is an honor to recognize him and his many accomplishments."
"Mr. Speaker, yes, again, it is one thing to try to go after fentanyl coming in through the mail, but the real problem is that it is coming in through containers and so forth, and so are the precursor chemicals. This whole thing of finding fentanyl in the mail is a tiny fraction of what is inflicting this country. We really need to look at the container vessels and start inspecting. They just need to do a job inspecting."
"I think my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House is right to remind us of the many breaches of this rule by Her Majesty's Government when the Conservative party was in power. However, in the middle of this mud-slinging, let me raise a still small voice of calm. The current Prime Minister pledged to be more transparent, open and proper in government. Will my right hon. Friend go back to the Cabinet and remind it that proper scrutiny in this House first, with untrammelled questions for an hour or more at a time, is more scrutiny than the Government would get in a press conference and is the proper place to do this? I hope she will take that message back, so that statements such as the one we are about to hear are given on the Floor of the House first."
"Mr. Speaker, I would remind my hon. colleague that extortion is illegal in Canada, and those who perpetrate it should be apprehended and punished to the full extent of the law. Specifically, if the hon. member examines this section of the Criminal Code, he will see that there are mandatory minimums when it comes to certain offences committed with a firearm relating to extortion. Moreover, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life. The rules reflect the seriousness with which the government takes extortion. We look forward to working with law enforcement to give them the tools they need to investigate these crimes and prevent them from taking place in the first instance."
"Mr. Speaker, it is hard to answer that question in 20 seconds. However, I have managed a dairy business for almost 40 years, so I know how to budget. An operating budget and a fixed budget is the proper way to manage the finances of this nation, just like the way I manage the finances of my business."
"Mr. Speaker, I think it is very important, when we come back to it, that the U.S. is an important partner for Canada. We know companies rely on trade with the U.S., but as we rely on that trade, we want to make sure we open up new markets around the world. That is what our businesses are asking for at this time, and I will continue to focus on that as the Minister of Trade."
"I thank the Minister very much for her answers. Worryingly, obesity levels are predicted to rise between 20% and 30% in the next five to 10 years. To combat that, physical education is important, as is the Government looking at children's diets at school. Those two things can address obesity, so I am keen to hear the Minister's thoughts on them."
"The Mother of the House, the right hon. Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), is absolutely right to stress the importance of giving a voice to the voiceless. That is a role that many Members in this House take deeply seriously, including proponents of this Bill. No one is more voiceless in this debate than those terminally ill adults who suffered painful, traumatic and undignified deaths under the current system, as well as their families. Nothing that I could say makes the case for this Bill--not just the principle, but this Bill--more powerfully than this letter from my constituent, which is adapted to protect her anonymity: ""Following a diagnosis of an aggressive tumour, my partner's final days were agony. He struggled to breathe and swallow and lost his ability to speak. He was incontinent & developed painful bedsores. He repeatedly asked for help to end his life. I entered his room to see that he had stuffed yards of his top sheet into his mouth in an attempt to suffocate. It was the most distressing sight and one I will never forget. I live with this image and cannot share it with our children. This could have been avoided with an assisted dying law."""
"I am grateful that at least one of the Opposition parties accepts that there is a deal. The hon. Member is right to recognise that the implementation phase is what we are now relentlessly focused on. I am sure the House will be aware of the statement issued overnight by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, confirming that the US will expedite the agreed quota for car exports to the United States, reducing tariffs from 27.5% to 10%. The Government continue to work on this important deal."
"Mr. Speaker, the tax cut that the Liberals are proposing does very little for my constituents in Miramichi—Grand Lake. If the Liberals wanted to make a difference, they would cut the carbon tax completely: not just the consumer carbon tax, but the industrial carbon tax. Axe the tax completely."
Agreed. On division.
The hon. member.
"You are very kind, Madam Deputy Speaker--we got there in the end. I thank the Secretary of State for his statement, which is full of positivity. Everyone here welcomes it deep down, and if they do not, then they should: well done, Minister, and well done this Government. While I welcome the news that more than 7,000 British businesses are set to see their electricity bills slashed by up to 25% by 2027, it is clear that much more support is needed,  such as a reduction in corporation tax, especially for businesses in Northern Ireland, which borders the Republic of Ireland where the corporation tax rate is half of our rate at 12.5%. Will the Secretary of State discuss that with his Cabinet colleagues in order to provide greater support for our industries in Northern Ireland?"
"Mr. Chair, that is for the hundreds or thousands of workers who lost their jobs after all the Liberals' anti-development policies. The Liberals say new pipelines only if there is a national consensus. What is a national consensus?"
If she will make a statement on her departmental responsibilities.
The time has elapsed. The next member to be recognized is the hon. member for Elgin—St. Thomas—London South.
"Mr. Speaker, I have had lots of opportunities to work with the member opposite on this specific legislation in the House during the last Parliament. I remember when we were able to pass it and commit it to families across Canada, some of whom were our constituents. We told them that we were committed to making sure that we were not going to have their children lose their citizenship and that they were not going to be part of the list of lost Canadians. I remember, if my memory serves me correctly, the member opposite supported this. What changed?"
"Mr. Chair, why is the government spending billions of dollars to house asylum seekers in hotels in Toronto when many Torontonians cannot afford rent?"
"Madam Chair, that was very good; they are all the same, which emphasizes what it is that Canadians were saying at the doors, and that is one of the reasons 8.5 million Canadians voted for the Prime Minister and the Liberal candidates throughout the country. The Liberal Party was the only political party to actually get a member elected in every province. I believe that this evening we have heard from two of the ministers who are playing a very important role. I think of the issue of international trade. In the past 10 years, we have actually had more trade agreements signed off on than in any other administration in the 40 or 50 previous years, and now there is a minister who has really taken charge of what the Prime Minister has said. The Prime Minister wants us to be able to diversify and to look at other countries and how we can increase exports. That is why I was really encouraged, even in the off-the-cuff question I had for the Minister of International Trade , when I made reference to the Phillippines, a country I am very passionate about because I see the potential that is there and match it with some of the things the Prime Minister is talking about. There are many countries we can look at and enhance trading opportunities with. This is actually incorporated into our legislative agenda. There is also the Minister of Finance and National Revenue , who has done a fantastic job of getting the legislation that is so critically important. Again, in the last election, what commitment was made? To deal with the issue of affordability, the Prime Minister made it very clear that he wanted to give Canadians a tax break. That is what the Minister of Finance has been working on, bringing forward legislation that not only gives a tax break to 22 million Canadians but also brings in a first-time homebuyer tax break on the first $1 million for people who are purchasing new homes, thereby helping first-time homebuyers while at the same time encouraging and promoting housing construction. These are two very important initiatives that complement what the Prime Minister committed to prior to the election being called, which was to cancel the carbon tax. We have a new Prime Minister with a new mandate and a new government that have brought these initiatives forward for debate and ultimately passage here in the House of Commons, as has been demonstrated this evening with the ministers presenting on the estimates, estimates that the Conservative Party voted for. The Conservatives were not alone. Every member of Parliament voted in favour of the ways and means motion, which is the estimates, and we appreciate that vote of confidence. At the end of the day, I truly believe that what we need to do is not just give the government a vote of confidence, thereby saying, yes, we are fulfilling in part a very major aspect of the last campaign, but, as part of that, also look at the legislative agenda. The legislative agenda does just that. It gets rid of the carbon tax in law, the consumer component. That is actually incorporated into Bill C-4 . Not only does it have that aspect, but it also ensures the tax cut for 22 million taxpayers. Eliminating the GST for first-time homebuyers is also incorporated into Bill C-4. Think about it. These are three major initiatives in the legislation, a part of the Prime Minister 's campaign to deliver for Canadians. I believe that every member of the House supports it. After all, they supported and voted unanimously in favour of the ways and means motion. One would think they would support this legislation. Why is the legislation important? It is because the tax break is to take effect on July 1, which is coming up soon. Everyone needs to be aware of that. I hope the Conservatives will recognize the value of passing that particular piece of legislation. The good news does not stop there. The Minister of Finance talked about having the strongest economy in the G7. The Minister of Finance is not alone. The Prime Minister has been talking about that fairly extensively. We want to build that strong economy. We can talk about Bill C-5 . Bill C-5 does just that, recognizing one Canadian economy. That will make a difference. There are also the border controls in Bill C-2 . These three are wraparounds to address election platform issues that every member not only should be looking at but should be getting passed, I would suggest. My question for the Minister of Finance is related to Bill C-4 in particular: How critically important is it that we deliver tax breaks on July 1? We need to see Bill C-4 passed, as well as the other two pieces of legislation. Can he provide his thoughts with regard to the Prime Minister 's commitment, how this legislation in good part delivers for Canadians, and the responsibility of the opposition, in particular the Conservative Party, to see the legislation go through?"
I call the shadow Minister.
"Mr. Chair, Bill C-48 was a result of consultations and engagements we had with the provinces and territories. We will continue to do those engagements and bring forward the appropriate—"
"Questions and comments, the hon. member for Winnipeg North."
"This Government are committed to the probity of the planning process at all levels to ensure robust and evidence-based decision making. The process includes a role for planning Ministers in deciding on called-in planning applications and recovered appeals, so I hope that the House will appreciate why I cannot comment in any detail on specific planning applications at the Dispatch Box. That said, it may be helpful to Members if I set out the process that these cases follow. The application referred to by the right hon. Member was considered to meet the published call-in policy set out in the October 2012 written ministerial statement, so it will be determined by Ministers. The application is not yet with the Department. All decisions that come before Ministers are subject to examination by an independent planning inspector, usually through a public inquiry. The planning inspector then provides an evidence-based recommendation, and set out their full reasons for that recommendation. The inspector's report considers the application against published local, regional and national planning policy, which is likely to contain a wide variety of material planning considerations; in this case, those are likely to include safety and national security. A public inquiry was held on this case between 11 and 28 February, at which interested parties were able to put forward evidence and make representations. Should any further representations be made that raise material planning considerations before the decision is made, they will also be taken into account. At all times, the decision will be dealt with in line with the published propriety guidance on planning casework decisions. The right hon. Member will be aware that the Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary made a joint representation to the Planning Inspectorate ahead of the start of the inquiry. That will be taken into account, alongside all other relevant matters. Once the planning inspector's report and recommendation is received, the case will be determined by a planning Minister, who will come to a decision based on material planning considerations."
"The hon. and learned Member will know that the Abortion Act is not going to be amended. New clause 1 will only take women out of the criminal justice system because they are vulnerable and they need our help. I have said it before, and I will say it again: just what public interest is being served in the cases I have described? This is not justice; it is cruelty, and it has to end. Backed by 180 cross-party MPs and 50 organisations, and building on years of work by Dame Diana Johnson, my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull North and Cottingham--"
"I thank my hon. Friend the Member for South Devon (Caroline Voaden) for securing this important debate. In my constituency, an estimated 1,638 people are living with dementia, which is above the national average. However, beyond those numbers are the stories of individual people, each with their own unique experience of living with dementia. Dementia does not discriminate; it can impact anyone, robbing them of their best memories and devastating families and friends in its wake. I also commend those who dedicate themselves to caring for and supporting those with dementia. I have been lucky enough to meet some of them in Melksham and Devizes. Recently, I visited a branch of the Nationwide bank in Devizes, which has been hosting dementia-friendly sessions and acting as a support hub for those with dementia. It was truly heartwarming to see the friendships and bonds formed between the regular customers and the staff, who have undertaken special training to help them. However, I must also point out the impact that the hike in employers' national insurance contributions is having on care providers, including those providing care for people with dementia. The care sector already operates on a razor-thin margin, and these rises have increased operational costs drastically, affecting not only the budgets of the individuals and local authorities who will be picking up the added burden, but hospices, which are being faced with difficult choices over who they can care for and for how long, and how to raise sufficient funds to continue operating."
"One in four women experience mental health challenges during pregnancy or after birth; in fact, it is the most common complication of pregnancy in the UK. Last month, almost 50 hon. Members of this House pledged their support for improved maternal mental health provision at an event that I hosted with the Maternal Mental Health Alliance. Will the Leader of the House advise on further opportunities to embed better maternal mental health provision in the Government's 10-year plan for the NHS?"
The hon. member has the floor. Would she like to ask her question?
"Mr. Speaker, one year ago today, the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs released a landmark report. “Invisible No More. The Experiences of Canadian Women Veterans” was the first of its kind, finally putting on record women veterans' unique and often painful stories. From poor equipment more likely to injure than protect to unimaginable sexual trauma, more than 50 women showed their immense courage in sharing with the committee the realities of their service. A tireless advocate for women veterans, Dr. Karen Breeck, rightly said: I hope a day like this isn't just about appreciation for our service—I hope it becomes a day where women Veterans engage with their communities and parliamentarians to work together toward making things better for the next generation of women who wish to serve their country I am honoured and humbled to stand in the presence of the incredible veterans joining us today in recognition of women veterans appreciation day. This is not a day for meaningless platitudes, but measurable action. It is my hope that this report paves the way for countless more women to serve Canada with pride and dignity."
Will my hon. Friend give way?
"Mr. Speaker, I am rising today on behalf of constituents in my riding who are petitioning the government about a common-sense idea. While the cellphone number known as *16 is used to contact the Canadian Coast Guard in the event of water-related emergencies, it is currently voluntary and only available in some regions of Canada. Therefore, the petitioners are calling upon the Government of Canada to expand the *16 number by making it accessible Canada-wide by compelling all telecommunications companies to recognize *16 as a way to contact the Canadian Coast Guard in the event of water-related emergencies."
The hon. member for Skeena—Bulkley Valley.
"I thank the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee for once again highlighting to the House all the forthcoming Backbench Business debates, and look forward to receiving from him and colleagues representations on how we hold estimates day debates. I am sure we can all agree that that probably does need to be looked at. I join the hon. Gentleman in wishing everybody who is celebrating this weekend in his constituency and beyond a happy chariot festival, as I think it is also known. I hope that he and others keep cool, wear suncream and drink lots of water on their downhill walk."
"This morning, I visited Horiba Mira, which employs thousands of people across the west midlands. It was a privilege to visit with the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and the Chancellor. I am sure that the Secretary of State will agree that one of the highlights of that visit was the excitement on the apprentices' faces. After 14 years of low investment in the west midlands under the Conservatives, does he agree that this industrial strategy will deliver opportunities for young people and the manufacturing industries in North Warwickshire and Bedworth?"
"In Burslem, a memorial to our Royal Doulton fallen was very sadly lost. I am proud to have joined a campaign led so brilliantly by Mike Lightfoot, ably supported by the former MP Joan Walley, St Modwen Homes and others, to reinstate the memorial, which will be unveiled on VJ Day this August. With Armed Forces Day approaching, will the Leader of the House join me in thanking Mike and the team for their commitment to ensuring that those who made the ultimate sacrifice will never be forgotten?"
"Mr. Speaker, what is the action plan to bring these tariffs down?"
"the late Jack Valenti, the once Special Assistant to LBJ turned longtime President of the Motion Picture Association, once said:  Every good speech contains six words: Let me tell you a story.  I have taken Jack Valenti's advice to heart. I have often told stories that might otherwise have been ignored--stories of the most vulnerable members of our community, those who might not be able to obtain the services of communications agencies, white-shoe law firms, and high-profile lobbyists. For decades, I have been honored tohave one of the best storytellers on Capitol Hill helping me. For more than 20 years, Molly Rowley, my director of speechwriting, has helped shaped some of my spoken words. Monday, June 30, will mark her final day on my staff. Molly is not from Illinois. Her family hails from Missouri, and she is always happy to remind us and our colleagues that her Kansas City Chiefs are regular playoff contenders and repeat Super Bowl champions. She began her career as a newspaper reporter, but she eventually found her way into public service, writing speeches from New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio, the late-Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania, and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota. In 2005--20 years ago--Molly came to my office after working for Senator Daschle when he was the Democratic leader of the Senate. Before leaving Senator Daschle's office, Molly had written a compelling floor speech that caught my attention. I went over to Senator Daschle and asked if he had a staffer who helped him write that speech, and he mentioned Molly. Fast-forward to 2005, when I was the brandnew whip of the Democratic caucus looking for staffers with leadership office experience. Molly was the perfect person to bring on board. Speechwriting is part art and part science but really not either one. It is translating complex policy issues into a compelling narrative. That is not always an easy thing to do. For Molly, her process starts with a simple question: How would this affect the average family in Illinois? She has a knack for turning arcane legislative text into poetry, and she often did so with little time and even less background. If you were to strike up a conversation with Molly, it would not take long for you to notice her passion for language, creativity, and a deep pride in her Irish roots, like so many in my home State of Illinois. She was able to add some special Irish charm to many of my speech materials over the years, from immigration events to Chicago's notable St. Patrick's Day celebrations. Molly's source material knew no bounds. She would artfully weave into my remarks quotes from our Nation's Founding Fathers; landmark speeches of Presidents like Illinois' very own Abraham Lincoln; civil rights icons like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the late-Congressman John Lewis; prose of the Irish literary giants James Joyce and William Butler Yeats; and even hit Broadway musicals like Lin-Manuel Miranda's ``Hamilton.'' She excelled at uncovering obscure facts about a small town or community and using it as a centerpiece to tie a speech together. Whether ribbon cuttings for local health clinics, naturalization ceremonies, commencement addresses, or Senate floor speeches, Molly did so much more than prepare remarks; she found the heart of the story. Molly's interest and commitment to social justice and civil rights has been evident not only in her work but in the way she participated in life on Capitol Hill. A lot of history has been made in these hallways, and Molly has made herself a part of it, whether chronicling the lying in honor of Rosa Parks, State of the Union speeches by President Obama, or being seated in the middle of the room for the Judiciary hearings for the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to be a Justice of the Supreme Court. I am grateful to have had Molly as a member of my team for all of these years and to help me tell these stories. I am confident she will use her gift of words to raise awareness of current events, not just in her community and country but globally. But, first, she will take a well-deserved break and explore Europe with her mom before returning to spend time with her beloved four- legged roommate Liam. I will miss Molly's wisdom, skill, and rhetorical flourishes. I would like to close my remarks with her own words about leaving Capitol Hill. Molly wrote recently:  My favorite part of the Capitol has long been the soft dips in the stairs where the hard marble has worn down by more than a century and a half of footsteps. Those indentations always remind me that we are part of a great continuum. We do our best while we are here to protect our beloved democracy and then we move on, hoping and trusting that those who come after us will also safeguard this priceless gift.  Molly, on your watch, you kept this gift safe. I am glad to be part of your career on Capitol Hill and a recipient of so much good work. I wish you the best."
"I rise today to commemorate the ten-year anniversary of Obergefell v. Hodges, a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that affirmed marriage equality nationwide on June 26, 2015. This ruling positively impacted the lives of millions of LGBTQIA+ Americans and serves as a significant milestone toward equal rights for all. I wish to honor the legacies of Jim Obergefell, his late husband John Arthur, and all the couples who brought the battle for marriage equality to the steps of the United States Supreme Court. Furthermore, I would like to honor the incredible activists--Marsha P. Johnson, Bayard Rustin, Audre Lorde and Harvey Milk--who played instrumental roles in fighting for LGBTQIA+ rights decades before this case reached the Supreme Court. To this day, their legacies inspire Americans to advocate, celebrate, and respect the differences we have as people to promote equal rights. It is fitting that this anniversary falls during Pride Month, a time to recognize the strength and perseverance of the LGBTQIA+ community as well as a call to action for equality. Unfortunately, the Trump Administration and extremist Republicans are attacking LGBTQIA+ rights around the country. These extremists are banning books that feature LGBTQIA+ characters from schools, eliminating the suicide prevention hotline for LGBTQIA+ individuals, rolling back civil rights protections, and undermining the health, military service, and education of LGBTQIA+ Americans. House Republicans recently passed a dangerous bill out of Committee that threatens to jail parents and doctors offering medically-affirming care to trans youth. Policymakers in Washington should not make private health decisions for Americans. LGBTQIA+ individuals are humans and deserve equal civil rights protections under the law, autonomy, and dignity. I reject extremist efforts to promote hate and harm based on who one loves or how they self-identify. In the face of these intensified efforts to hurt LGBTQIA+ individuals, I promise to continue to fight for equal rights for LGBTQIA+ Americans. We must protect same-sex marriages and civil rights laws for LGBTQIA+ individuals. We must enact the Equality Act that would amend the Civil Right Act of 1964 to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. We must enact my bill--the John Lewis Every Child Deserves a Family Act--that would prohibit any entity that receives federal child welfare funds from discriminating against children, youth, or prospective adoptive or foster parents based on religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. I am committed to continuing to support legislation that protects the rights of LGBTQIA+ individuals because everyone deserves the right to be who they are, free from discrimination. Celebration is an act of resistance. In the face of an administration that wants to reinvigorate injustice and discrimination against LGBTQIA+ people, it is essential to celebrate our country's landmark marriage equality ruling and Pride month and to commit ourselves to ensuring that ``We the People'' includes all Americans."
"I rise today to honor Eric Amick as he prepares for retirement after more than 23 years of service to the U.S. House of Representatives. Eric was born in Cumberland, Maryland. In 1976, he graduated from Bishop Walsh High School. After high school, Eric attended Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, where in 1980, he earned a bachelor's degree in computer science. After college, Eric worked as a software engineer for S3 Technologies, NeuraITech, and Banktech. In August 2002, Eric joined the Legislative Computer Systems, a division of the Office of the Clerk, as a software engineer. During his tenure, Eric worked on numerous mission critical applications, including the Electronic Voting System (EVS), the xMetaL, Member Information System (MIS), and most recently the Legislative Information Management system (LIMS). Eric's expertise in House documents and legislative data has been critical to many of the behind-the-scenes legislative activities that help this institution run smoothly. Eric has dedicated 23 years of his professional career to the Office of the Clerk. He has worked under six Speakers of the House: the Honorables J. Dennis Hastert, Nancy Pelosi, John A. Boehner, Paul D. Ryan, Kevin McCarthy, and now, Mike Johnson. In addition, Eric has worked for five Clerks of the House: the Honorables Jeff Trandahl, Karen L. Haas, Lorraine C. Miller, Cheryl L. Johnson, and Kevin F. McCumber. Post retirement, Eric is looking forward to his next chapter of adventures. He plans to spend more time with his lifelong hobby, which includes trivia, crossword puzzles, and board games. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, I want to thank Eric Amick for his wonderful service to this institution."
"Mr. Speaker, I listened intently for the last few minutes, and the member opposite asked for any suggestions or amendments. One of the things I would like to put forward is that in this legislation, Bill C-3 , there is no talk of any background or security checks for any of these people who could be getting clearance and citizenship to come to Canada. I wonder if the Liberals feel that maybe it is a good idea to include that in this bill, going forward."
"if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous order. There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:09 p.m., adjourned until Monday, June 9, 2025, at 3 p.m."
"I do not agree with the hon. Lady's proposed piece of legislation, so I will not be supporting it. I think that that is the wrong approach, although she has highlighted the right problem. We are moving as quickly as possible to plan the transition properly, although we should have been doing that many years ago when it started, and as a result we have lost a third of the workforce in the past 10 years. More than 70,000 people have lost their jobs because we failed to plan for this. I recognise the problem that the hon. Lady has described, but I think that the answer is for us to do two things: to manage the existing fields and support the industry for the lifetime of those fields, and to build up, at speed, investment in the industries that come next. In the spending review the Government supported industries in respect of carbon capture and storage and hydrogen, and, of course, significant investments in the supply chain through Great British Energy to ensure that we are building infrastructure in this country again and securing the jobs that come with it. The transition is important, and we are doing all that we can to ensure that workers are at the heart of it."
"Order. I accept that we have some experts in the Chamber, but I remind Members that speeches and interventions must relate to the business at hand and the amendments."
"Madam Speaker, Canadians are working harder than ever, but so many feel as if they are falling behind. In Burnaby Central, I have spoken to families struggling with rising rent, students worrying about groceries and seniors stretching every dollar. That is why our government is focusing on real, measurable relief by lowering taxes for the middle class, investing in housing and in child care, and helping people hold on to more of what they earn, because a strong economy is measured not just in numbers alone; it is measured in whether people can build a good life for themself and their family."
"My constituents have watched in horror as Israeli forces have reportedly killed more than 400 Palestinians and injured thousands more at aid distribution centres in Gaza. Over the weekend, dozens more Palestinians were killed while trying to access humanitarian aid. Why are the Government still permitting the transfer of F-35 components to Israel through the international pool, knowing that these aircrafts may be used in operations causing mass civilian casualties?"
"Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the member for Guelph on her maiden speech. I cannot help but reflect on the question that came from our Conservative colleague a few moments ago. On the one hand, they are basically saying that folks are struggling, and they are identifying the realities of what is going on in our country. On the other hand, they are saying, how dare we spend money on actually trying to help people. I think that this is a key difference between Liberals and Conservatives. We see not just the responsibility, but also the opportunity to invest in people and provide them with the resources they need to be able to achieve that quality of life that they desire. Can the member comment on that?"
"Mr. Speaker, Canada Day may still be a couple of weeks away, but the students of East Elgin Secondary School are already putting their pride in our great country on display. Over 30 grade 10 art students, led by teachers Robert Ponzio and Aimee Sawyers, have spent months crafting a magnificent 16-foot-by-20-foot mural of a Canadian flag made up of self-portraits of all of the young artists. The masterpiece is called On Guard for Thee . It is a vibrant and patriotic expression of the community's diversity and Canadian identity. The project was supported by the Royal Canadian Legion branches in Port Burwell and Aylmer, and some of the communities' veterans have already had a chance to take it in. Those who have served and helped build our country get to see the spirit of Canada alive in the next generation. The mural has already been showcased at the Aylmer legion and will soon be presented at the Old Imperial Market. The teachers and students hope to bring their work of art to the provincial capital and eventually on to Ottawa to share their love of Canada with as many people as possible. Congratulations to all the artists. Go, Eagles."
"Mr. Speaker, the member has been here for several years. I have to chuckle because he is saying the Prime Minister said we need sustainable immigration levels. That is acknowledging the Liberals have not had sustainable immigration levels for many years. That is the record they are going on. This is not a new government; it is a continuation of the same government. We have seen the Liberals break caps they promised to pile on. We are seeing a system just as backlogged. We are seeing just as much frustration in an archaic system when it comes to immigration. It is broken, and they cannot be trusted to fix the system that they themselves broke."
"Mr. Speaker, this is one of the things that has left me the most excited about our plan, because it is a significant package of cuts and supports for the middle class. It includes reducing the taxes by 1%, which would bring the average family about $850 extra into their pockets per year. There are many other inclusions, such as dental care. I worked in dentistry for 22 years. Having access to dental care actually supports the health of the whole body. It is a big expense for families, but they can have this care free of charge. It is not just for young people; everyone aged 18 to 64 can have this great support. There is also child care, and there is the reduction of GST on the purchase of a first home, so there are many different supports. I am very excited, and the people at the doorstep were as well."
"I remain hugely concerned about the appalling human rights record of the Iranian regime, but who runs Iran must, quite properly, be a matter for the people of Iran."
"I thank the hon. Member for his intervention. Of course, these are difficult things to disentangle. People will say, ""You would say this, wouldn't you, Ben?"", but we should get the person in front of a psychiatrist or a clinical nurse specialist working in psychiatry. This is what psychiatry does; this is what it is about. That is why I tabled amendments to ensure that the person is put in front of a psychiatrist as part of the process to deal with the blind spot. [Interruption.] Apologies, Madam Deputy Speaker; I will finish now. My amendment would ensure that the code of practice clarifies the interaction with services."
"I will not; I want to finish in the time available, and I think Members want to hear the full response. Outside of company-led EAPs, there are established routes for patients to get access to new, innovative medicines prior to them being licensed. The early access to medicines scheme, or EAMS, helps give people in the UK with life-threatening or seriously debilitating conditions early access to new medicines that are not yet licensed where there is a clear unmet medical need. EAMS is supported by key partners, including the MHRA, NICE and NHS England, and is a key part of this Government's commitment to accelerating patient access to innovative, life-changing treatments, in support of the UK's position as a global leader in life sciences. In fact, since the scheme launched in 2014, over 50 medicines, including for this disease, have benefited from being accessed early through EAMS. The innovative medicines fund has also made available PS340 million of ringfenced funding for the NHS to fund early access to medicines that NICE has recommended with managed access. Through this process, licensed treatments that demonstrate substantial clinical promise but still have significant uncertainty around their clinical and cost-effectiveness can be funded. Further evidence is then collected on the drug for a defined period of time. That is considered by NICE in determining whether the drug can be recommended for routine NHS funding. The Secretary of State has been clear that if givinostat is recommended by NICE in draft guidance, NHS England should aim to work with the pharmaceutical company to provide early funding through the innovative medicines fund. This could potentially speed up access by up to five months, and the treatment could be funded as soon as this summer, if recommended. This scope of this debate is wider than just access to new medicines. It is important to note that while rare diseases are individually rare, they are collectively common. One in 17 people will be affected by a rare condition over their lifetime. The UK rare diseases framework outlines four priorities, based on engagement with the rare disease community. They are: helping patients to get a final diagnosis faster, increasing awareness of rare diseases among healthcare professionals, better co-ordination of care, and improving access to specialist  care, treatments and drugs. In England, we publish a rare diseases action plan annually. These detail the specific steps we are taking to meet the shared priorities of the framework. I am pleased to highlight the 2025 England action plan, which was published in February this year on Rare Disease Day. One such action is reviewing the effectiveness of early access schemes, such as the early access to medicines scheme, the innovative licensing and access pathway, and the innovative medicines fund. They are all designed to help make innovative treatments available earlier to patients who need them. We are specifically considering how well they support access to treatment for people living with rare diseases like Duchenne. NHS England, NICE and MHRA will meet annually to continue to discuss progress on these schemes. These meetings will include representatives from patient advocacy groups and from industry, and clinical researchers, and the next one will happen in the summer. Managing a complex rare condition can be challenging, and it often means interacting with many different specialists and providers of health and social care. It can mean travelling across the country to access highly specialist care from experts. All of that can add up to a significant emotional and physical burden, and it can deepen inequalities. Co-ordination of care can minimise this burden on patients and their carers, and it can ensure that healthcare professionals work together to provide the best possible care, as we have discussed this evening. In the 2025 action plan, we have introduced a new action to incentivise providers to run clinics for multi-system disorders, in order to reduce the number of appointments and improve co-ordination of care for families. The NHS is also working to include the definition of ""co-ordination of care"" that is set out in the CONCORD--co-ordinated care of rare diseases--study in all new and revised NHS service specifications for patients with rare diseases. I recognise how hard it is when patients want access to these new treatments. I also recognise the distress and worry it causes, not only to patients, but their families and friends. Hon. Members have articulated that well on behalf of their constituents this evening. The Government are committed to providing access to the most innovative medicines, but it has to be at a price that provides value for the NHS, and it has to be clinically safe and effective. That is why we are working hard with industry, NICE and MHRA to make that happen. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton North will continue to work with the Government and providers to make that happen. I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to this debate on such an important issue. Question put and agreed to. House adjourned."
"I rise today to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter and the establishment of one of the world's greatest organizations for peace and the advancement of humanity. As the Representative from San Francisco, this anniversary holds particular pride for the people of my city and for me. It was in San Francisco that we played host to the grand conference of delegates that wrote the U.N. Charter. It was in the San Francisco War Memorial and Performing Arts Center on June 26, 1947, that the charter was signed. On that day, President Harry S. Truman came to the plenary session to offer his congratulations and his hopes for the future of a new United Nations. He said: ``You have created a great instrument for peace and security and human progress in the world.'' President Truman said that, and he said: ``The world must use it now.'' The world must use it now. It was true then. It is true now. Eight decades later, 193 member states have ratified the charter. It was 50 that day. Then Poland joined, which made it 51. Mr. Speaker, 193 members have ratified the charter. The world's greatest leaders and thinkers have been among the United Nation's representatives. In 1946, United Nations General Assembly delegate and former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt helped draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which builds on Franklin Roosevelt's commitment to freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from fear, and freedom from want for all people.  {time}  1115  It has sought to advance human rights, human dignity, and opportunities for women and girls. It has focused the world's attention on the plight of refugees and the urgency of the climate crisis with its sustainable development goals. It has been a bulwark for global peace and peacekeeping. In striving to fulfill the ideas and promises of its charter, the United Nations, its related agencies, programs, and staff have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 11 times. In 1950, Ralph Bunche, an American, became the first person affiliated with the new organization to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In his acceptance speech, he remarked: ``I am but one of many cogs in the United Nations, the greatest peace organization ever dedicated to the salvation of mankind's future on Earth.'' Under the leadership of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the United Nations remains a strong, resolute, and unwavering voice for peace in a world burdened by war. Today, the United Nations is convening a plenary meeting of the General Assembly in New York at the United Nations headquarters to ``revive the spirit of San Francisco and once again embrace the ideals that united humanity during its darkest hour, reaffirming our commitment to those values into the future.'' May we recapture the spirit of solidarity that existed in San Francisco 80 years ago as the United Nations continues to stand as a beacon of peace for the next 80 years and beyond. Since I have a little more time, I want to tell a personal story. When I was in high school, this would be about a dozen years after the founding of the United Nations, President, then-Senator, Kennedy came to Baltimore for a great event. It was the United Nations Association of Maryland dinner honoring someone named Jacob Blaustein, a civic leader in our community. My father was the mayor of Baltimore. My mother, knowing how much I admired the Kennedy family because we were taught by Irish-Catholic nuns from Boston, even in Baltimore, she said: I don't think I feel well going to the dinner tonight. Why don't you take my place? Taking her place meant sitting next to Senator Kennedy for this dinner where he was giving the keynote address. There is a picture of that occasion. The reason why I tell the story is because I was a member of the United Nations Youth in high school. I was a junior in high school at the time. There was a table of United Nations Youth, and they came over to me and said: Since you are a member of the United Nations Youth, we invite you to sit with us at our table. Oh, my gosh, John F. Kennedy or United Nations Youth? As conflicted as I was, how could I leave a vacant seat next to Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts who was soon to become President of the United States? In any event, as I said at the beginning, this holds a special particular pride for me personally, as well as officially."
"I wanted to just give a quick update on a project I was working on last week to my fellow Senators. I spent the last week, during Memorial Day week, in the Middle East. Angus King and I actually traveled to Baghdad, Erbil, Beirut, and Oman. And then Angus left out for Turkiye, and I left out for Jerusalem. It is exceptionally helpful to be able to walk through the different countries of the region right now. Obviously, there is a tremendous amount of instability around Syria. We had the opportunity to be able to ask leaders in every single one of those countries about the future of Syria and the options that are there and what could happen. It is to America's best interest to be able to have a stable Middle East and a functioning relationship in all of those countries. Just a quick walk-through of a couple things that I think are important there: In Baghdad, they are actively working to be able to reach out to American companies. There is a real interest there and, quite frankly, a growth in Baghdad's economy, in Iraq's economy. They are trying to be able to stabilize, though they are still very close to Iran and to Tehran. As chilling as it is, when I went in to meet with the Prime Minister, you can't go to the Prime Minister's office without going through the large traffic circle right outside his office, where he has a giant depiction of the martyr Soleimani in front of his office. That is the Iranian head of the IRGC that actively worked to kill as many Americans as possible. It was a reminder that there are still challenges in this region, while they are still welcoming to American businesses. In Erbil, in the Kurdish Regional Government, they truly love America, and there is a true Western feel when you get to Erbil. They are open for commerce. They are open for capitalism. They are still a part of Iraq, but they are very interested in turning their attention toward the Western world and toward engaging in a great deal of American business. In fact, one of the most prideful moments of the conversation were on the American businesses that are coming through and engaging in the Kurdish Regional Government, in that area. To be able to see--I counted 15 cranes across Erbil, with the construction that is happening there. It is remarkable to be able to see the investment that is coming into that area. It is good for us to continue to be able to maintain relationships with that region, and they are grateful to be able to be a partner to the United States. But even they are saying to their Kurdish friends that are over on the eastern side of Syria that they should turn their attention toward Damascus in forming a unified Syrian Government. In the broad diversity that is Syria, with Kurds, with Turks, with Alawites, with Sunnis, with Shias, with Christians that are all in Syria in multiple areas and then in the broad swath of the desert area in the south, to still see a stronghold for ISIS that remains in Syria--it was a reminder again of the challenges this new Syrian Government has. It was interesting as well to me that every single one of the leaders that I met in the area all raised to me their gratitude for President Trump canceling the sanctions on Syria. They all said: We don't know exactly which way the Syrian Government is going to go. It is too early to be able to tell. But American sanctions would have prevented them from ever being successful in the future. So they expressed their gratitude over and over again to the United States for giving Syria a shot to be able to form its own country and its own nation. When we landed in Beirut, we landed on a Sunday. It was the Sunday before Memorial Day Monday. It was a sober reminder to wake up in Beirut at the Embassy compound and to just walk that half block from where I was staying there over to the memorial that is on the Embassy compound for the many, many lives that have been lost over the years in Beirut, including the 241 marines that died in the marine barracks in 1983. To be there on that ground on Memorial Day was sobering to say the least. But I have to tell you, I have been to Lebanon multiple times. I have met with the Lebanese leaders multiple times and with the Lebanese Armed Forces. I have never left Lebanon more optimistic than when I left Lebanon, when I took off. The new leadership there--President Aoun, the new Prime Minister there--is focused on fixing the banking system in Lebanon, fixing the port, repairing the airport, and getting a new economic infrastructure in place. They said over and over again: We are not looking for assistance coming to us; we are looking for investors to be able to be here. We want to be open for business and have people from all over the world to be able to come here to be able to do business, so we are going to get our systems right and get rid of corruption. They also said something that was a pretty remarkable statement. They said they want to have a monopoly on military weapons. Now, that may notseem like a big deal to us as Americans, but there have been two militaries in Lebanon for decades: Hezbollah's military and the Lebanese Armed Forces. The places where Hezbollah's military stands, the Lebanese Armed Forces don't go--until now. With Israel's bombardment of Hezbollah in the south, what is south of the Litani River, the Lebanese Armed Forces have moved into that area, and now the Lebanese Army is actually defending Lebanon--not some terrorist organization trying to be able to defend southern Lebanon; the Lebanese Armed Forces are actually stepping up to be able to do that. They are taking the lead in those areas, setting up posts. The government there is very focused on getting weapons out of the Palestinian refugee camps that are there in Lebanon and defanging Hezbollah in the south and Hezbollah in the Beqaa Valley bordering with Syria. They are serious about taking on drug interdictions along their border with Syria. They are serious about trying to be able to balance things out. I have to give kudos to Morgan Ortagus. She has done a phenomenal job there, and her name came up over and over again in my meetings with the Lebanese leaders as they saw her as a straight shooter and a good negotiator between Israel and Lebanon to be able to establish a lasting border and a lasting peace and relationships. There are American leaders--what they call the mechanism--there as well. That mechanism is helping monitor the cease-fire between Israel and Lebanon, and they have become a trusted partner to both sides of that border. We as the United States do make a difference when we engage in different parts of the world. Lebanon and Israel would not be experiencing the peace they are experiencing right now if it was not for American engagement. No other country in the world walks in and has the reputation that the United States of America does, so it allows us to be able to step in and help provide stability by just our presence and our engagement to be able to be there. There are not large numbers of Americans that are there, but it is to America's benefit to see peace between Lebanon and Israel, not just because of two countries far away in the Middle East, but in Israel-- there are 700,000 Americans in Israel right now--right now. If we want to be able to stand with those Americans that are right now in Israel, we don't want to see Hezbollah's rockets coming at our citizens from the north. We also have hundreds of thousands of Lebanese Americans and their families and Americans living in Lebanon. We should continue to be able to have our relationships and our engagement there to be able to provide a stable, lasting peace, and there is a shot for that like there has not been for decades between Lebanon and Israel. When we left out from Lebanon, we went to be able to meet the King in Amman, Jordan. He is a trusted partner with the United States, and he is passionate about bringing a peaceful relationship with the entire region. He is somebody who actively wants to see stable relationships and a stable region, and he is doing the work that it takes, hard work in that region on things like water. It is not a simple thing everywhere in the world like it is in most places in the United States. When you are in Jordan, that is a tough challenge. But the ability to be able to bring nations together, to be able to provide that kind of engagement with the country of Jordan and our friendship with the King there, matters. We left out from Amman, and I drove to Jerusalem. Israel is facing very real risks. This body knows it well, and we have had plenty of conversations about it for a very long time.  The United States stands with our ally Israel. It was interesting for me to be able to see Israeli press there that has a whisper going out among the Israeli press that the United States is walking away from Israel. That is far from the truth. The United States continues to stand with our ally and friend Israel. But Israel is facing a multifront war. What they are dealing with day after day after day, we as Americans would never put up with. We are now about 612 days past October 7 of last year. There are still hostages being held in Gaza today. Today, there are still hostages. There are still challenges being faced every single day. The day that I arrived in Israel happened to be the first day that a new strategy for getting humanitarian aid into Gaza started--that day. It was a chaotic day of a brandnew plan of, how do we not have huge bags of flour and food be delivered and then Hamas scoops those up and then Hamas tries to be able to portion it out as they choose and instead deliver boxes of food to a family where they have a week's worth of food there, to a group of people who have no chance to be able to get to a grocery store, no chance to be able to get options for food? So they experimented with a brandnew way to be able to do that--which was, by the way, an American-Israeli partnership--to be able to deliver that food into Gaza. That first chaotic day, tens of thousands of boxes of food were delivered to Gazans who are desperate. That led to the second day, a little better; the next day, a little better; the next day, a little better. Each day, they tried to figure out how to maintain security, how to maintain order, how to register people, and to be able to make sure as many people as possible are getting as much food as possible and to be able to get that out to people who desperately need the help. Each day, that humanitarian aid is getting better and better as they are learning how to be able to do it more effectively now. That is important to us because we care about all human life. We are Americans. We have people that we disagree with, people that we disagree with strongly, but we still care about the dignity of human life. So we are watching that aid actually go into the country, and I am proud, actually, that we as the United States, as private citizens in the United States, are a part of delivering that aid that is desperately needed there. But I will tell you, my conversation in Israel with key leadership there, including with the Prime Minister, always circles around the threat of Iran--always--because the rockets that are coming in from Gaza were paid for by Iran. The rockets and missiles and unmanned drones that were coming in from southern Lebanon were paid for by Iran. The missiles and rockets that are coming in from Yemen against Israel are paid for by Iran. As they face all the challenges that are around them--and I could go on and on and on--as they face all the challenges that are around them, we cannot forget that the Iranian people live under the thumb of an oppressive Iranian regime that is not just oppressive to their own people, they are the destabilizing force in the entire region. The one thing that is clear in this is that we have to make sure we strengthen our sanctions against the Iranian regime so that they cannot have more money to do more acts of terrorism. They can never ever have a nuclear weapon. That means no enrichment. That means no centrifuges. That means no opportunity to be able to create a nuclear weapon. Iran has used their centrifuge technology to be able to enrich uranium up to 60 percent. There is zero purpose for highly enriched uranium other than a weapon. They cannot in one moment say they are not trying to weaponize and in the next moment brag about how much they have enriched uranium. Those two don't go together. So we as Americans have to be vigilant because if you look at the flag of the Houthis in Yemen, the flag of the Houthis in Yemen has five phrases on it. Let me give you two of them: ``Death to the Jews'' and ``Death to the Americans.'' That is not a banner; that is their national flag. They are serious about it, and I think we shouldn't just say: No, they are kidding. They are not. So we cannot allow the Iranians to continue to be able to arm the rest of the area and to be able to bring the fight to us and pretend that is never going to happen. We have learned the lesson of 2001. People that are far away will do what they can in their deep hatred to come to us. So we should make sure that the Iranian regime never gets a nuclear weapon and that we remain clear and concise on that.  There are a lot of things that we can continue to be able to talk about as we talk about multiple regions around the world, but as we focus on so many areas around the world, we cannot lose focus on the Middle East--the opportunities and the promise that are there but also the threats that still remain. So let's stay vigilant. I yield the floor."
I call the shadow Secretary of State.
"I am entirely unclear, after that run-through of a number of different issues, whether the Conservatives welcome the extra investment in the NHS or oppose it. We know they oppose the means of funding it, but after that, I have no idea. At some point, they have to make up their mind whether they support that extra investment or not. As I said in my statement, if they do not, what out of the list of the improvements that we have already made would they not do? As Lord Darzi made clear, under the Conservatives' watch for 14 years the NHS was broken. Staff were left with out-of-date equipment and unable to do the job they needed to do. We agreed with Lord Darzi's diagnosis, but Conservative Members have still not said whether they agree with it, or apologised for the state they left the system in. I do not know whether the right hon. Member for Melton and Syston (Edward Argar) has not been able to read the elective reform plan or the urgent emergency care plan that we published recently. It is up to him to read those plans properly and try to understand what is happening. The right hon. Gentleman has started to do my job for me again, because he cites various think-tanks and people who have said that this cannot be done. Well, I can tell him that we were told, for example, that waiting lists would not drop in April because of seasonality, but we have shown--by keeping a relentless focus on the system, working closely with leaders on the frontline and being clear with officials in the Department--that it can be done. That is what we heard this morning. We are taking a relentless approach to spending, line by line, throughout the NHS and the Department of Health and Social Care. We have rolled up our sleeves and we will not accept putting more and more taxpayers' money into a leaky system, which is what happened under the right hon. Gentleman's Government. If he had read the patient satisfaction survey, he would know that taxpayers across the country, in all our constituencies, love the NHS. They understand that the Tory party broke it and that it will take long time to fix. They also know that they are paying more taxes for it and getting a worse service, and they expect us to do much better. That is what we have already shown we are doing, and what we will continue to do. I have outlined the capital that is going into the new hospital programme, which we are committed to, and we have already seen increases in diagnostic capability and surgical hubs throughout our constituencies. We will continue to do more of that. I agree with the right  hon. Gentleman that it is critical to ensure that social care is supported alongside the NHS. That is why PS4 billion is going into social care through our colleagues in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, and as he knows, Louise Casey will publish her interim report next year. We are clear that fiscal responsibility does not stop at the Treasury or down in Victoria Street with the Department of Health and Social Care. It is important that everybody in the NHS is aware that we are determined to fix the NHS and put it back on a sustained footing. There is record investment; that is our commitment to people, and I know from the people I worked with in the health service over many years that they are determined to make it better. Morale sank to an all-time low under the Conservative party, but we are raising that morale, and we will continue to work with the system to make sure that it is fit for the future."
"I congratulate the hon. Member for Blyth and Ashington (Ian Lavery). It is an honour to speak about the impact of the decline of local bank branches, which is an issue of such importance to my constituents. The closure of the Santander in Rustington is just the latest blow. The need for a robust and fair system of banking hubs is urgent. High streets have changed beyond recognition. Once, we had Barclays, NatWest and Lloyds on every corner. Now, 6,300 branches have closed since 2015, which is a 64% fall. Cash use may have dropped to 14% of payments, but millions still depend on it, especially the elderly, the disabled and the vulnerable. In places like Rustington, entire communities have been left without local banking. Some are forced online against their wishes, even when they cannot afford the technology or cannot physically use it. At the same time, they are increasing their exposure to phishing attacks. My constituent Roger Mallock has lost a life-changing sum of money to cyber-scammers. Post offices cannot fill the gaps; the queues are longer, and they cannot handle complex banking needs or take large cash deposits. Despite my appeals to Link, Rustington was denied a banking hub. I raised the matter directly with the Prime Minister and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury. As one constituent put it: ""Banks are licensed by the Government. Those licences should come with a duty to maintain local branches."" Consider a Ukrainian couple who came to Bognor Regis under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Thanks to the Santander branch, they opened accounts, and they continue to rely on in-person support due to language barriers; without it, they would lose hours from work and face serious barriers to managing their finances. They are not alone: many elderly and less mobile customers depend on face-to-face services. Banking hubs offer a limited solution. Only 108 hubs are operational out of the 224 planned, and they can take up to 12 months to open. Worse, the FCA's rules are too narrow, focused only on cash rather than on broader services. The last Government introduced the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023, which was a start but does not go far enough. Banking is not a luxury; it is a lifeline. We must ensure that digital innovation does not leave millions behind."
"In relation to the events in the middle east, my hon. Friend will appreciate that I will need to be briefed further before I can give the House an accurate update. In relation to the NATO summit, she will be pleased to know that thanks to the European Union reset deal secured by the Prime Minister, we now have an opportunity to participate further in EU defence programmes. The strategic defence review makes it very clear that our priority for our security is the Euratlantic area, and that the largest threat facing us at the moment is Russia; but, of course, Russia works in collaboration with a number of countries around the world, and collectively they pose a threat to the rules-based order. We will continue to work with our European allies, and indeed our American friends, to ensure that we have peace and security across the continent."
"I welcome the sanctions announced today by the Minister, which have been taken in conjunction with our allies, and his commitment to a Palestinian state. However, people in Gaza are starving. I want to update the Minister on one such person: Dr Radi, the elderly and frail father of my constituent Mo Radi. A few weeks ago, Dr Radi sought shelter in Al-Awda hospital with over 100 medical staff and patients, as he is a former practising doctor there. No food was allowed in, and the IDF destroyed the main water tanks. The hospital was bombed, and when Dr Radi left the hospital, he was stripped and humiliated by the IDF. He is now hungry, ill and alone, as the rest of his family in Gaza have been killed. What are we doing to protect the most vulnerable from dying? We need to increase aid and evacuations, and to end the killing in Gaza."
It is vital that we get a clear and accurate picture of what exactly is happening on the ground. That is absolutely essential to ensure transparency. What are this Government doing to progress access for journalists into Gaza?
"Mr. Chair, will the minister release the national interest project list?"
"I know in my district that foreign direct investment is important in creating jobs. I would certainly say that nationally this is an important piece of legislation. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."
"38 years ago on June 12, 1987, President Ronald Reagan stood at the Brandenburg Gate and called for the General Secretary of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall. That wall was originally built to prevent people from fleeing communist East Germany into democratic West Berlin. The legendary line that President Reagan spoke:  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.  Now, those lines were nearly left out of the speech after the advisers from the State Department and the National Security Council claimed that the statement was, in their words, ``too provocative.'' But President Reagan stood his ground. He wanted to speak directly to the hearts of the divided world and take a moral stance against tyranny. President Reagan's words resonated with millions of East Germans. These East Germans dreamed of freedom. Two years later, the wall came down. It turned out that Reagan's words were prophetic--not provocative. Russia only understands strength. We still know that today. I have reminded my colleagues of this fact in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Weakness is what provokes a KGB man like Putin. President Biden was too timid in his approach, trying to manage escalation. Had the West instead given the Ukrainians what they needed earlier, they might have pushed Russia out of their country by now. President Trump ought to not make the same mistake that President Biden made. I think Putin thinks that he can play President Trump. Putin's lackey, former ``puppet'' President Medvedev, admitted recently what Russia wants is not peace but in his words ``swift victory'' and, again, in his words a ``complete destruction'' of the Ukrainian Government. Putin will only respond to strength, and this Congress ought to give President Trump the tools to stand up to Putin with strong sanctions that plug the loopholes in the current Biden sanctions. I yield the floor."
The hon. member for Niagara West has the floor.
"Mr. Speaker, before I start with the matter at hand, I would like to take a moment to wish one of my constituents a belated happy birthday. Mrs. Winnie Lynn celebrated her 100th birthday on June 10. She is an inspiration to me and to all who know her, including her four sons and many grandchildren, nieces and nephews. As the daughter of an itinerant minister, she travelled across the globe with her family, her father, before she set roots in Windsor in 1947. Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Lynn married a naval officer of the Royal Canadian Navy. Besides raising her sons and being there for her family, friends and neighbours, she volunteered with the Canadian Cancer Society for over 50 years and has consistently worked on improving and helping our community. It is citizens like Mrs. Lynn who are the glue that binds our families and communities together. Once again, I wish a happy birthday to Mrs. Lynn. On a sadder note, we all heard the tragic news of the crash of the Air India flight originating from Ahmedabad, India, a city where many of my friends live and where I have flown from before. My heart aches for the families who have lost loved ones. We as Canadians share their grief, as we too lost a citizen in the tragic crash. We will pray for those who are no longer with us and will stand with the families in this painful hour. May the Almighty grant everyone strength and peace. With respect to the matter at hand, today Canadians are watching to see whether their Parliament can still do the basics—"
"I very strongly hear what my hon. Friend is saying. At these times, we always remember those affected by the Hillsborough disaster, particularly their plight ever since in fighting for justice and accountability. That is why this Government are committed to introducing a Hillsborough law, which will include a duty of candour. As I said in answer to a previous question, it is vital that we get that legislation right--that it is workable and watertight in legal terms, but also meets the expectations and needs of the families and all those affected. That is why we are working at pace and working closely with the families and their representatives, and we will bring forward that legislation at a time when we get it right."
"Mr. Speaker, I have, quite frankly, been proud of the way the provinces have moved on this. My problem is that during the campaign, the Prime Minister did not say the Liberals would talk to the provinces and do their best. He said there would be free trade in Canada by Canada Day. He misled Canadians, and that is very troubling. It was a big part of the election campaign and, quite frankly, he misled Canadians. That is just not right."
"I think the hon. Lady and I fundamentally differ on the issue of demand management, because demand for air travel is only going one way, and it is therefore our moral responsibility, if we are going to have more people in the skies, to reduce the carbon emissions associated with that. As I said, we have no time to waste. That is why, when it comes to aviation, this Government have rolled up their sleeves and got on with the job, putting an end to the dither and delay of the past. In less than a year, we have approved the expansion of Luton airport and invited plans for a new runway at Heathrow, and I will be making a final decision on Gatwick expansion as soon as possible. We have invested in the future of aviation, not just with the help we have given to reopen Doncaster Sheffield airport or the work we are doing to strengthen connectivity around Liverpool John Lennon, but also by putting PS1 billion towards aerospace technology. We have introduced the sustainable aviation fuel mandate and provided PS63 million to the advanced fuels fund, helping the industry prepare for a sustainable future. Just last week, we kick-started the largest redesign of UK airspace since the 1950s, paving the way for cleaner flights, fewer delays and more direct routes. This is what governing for growth looks like."
"I will start with my hon. Friend's very last point, which is that we all agree that copyright law is clear--we do. I hope people understand that the Government's position is clear that copyright law is clear. I do not think that is in doubt. Secondly, of course, we always have the power to introduce legislation. However, certainly if I were sitting on the Opposition Benches, I would doubt whether it would be right to introduce transparency requirements solely on the basis of secondary legislation, which--as I say--would probably have to contain some sort of enforcement mechanism and potentially a new offence. I would say, ""Secondary legislation is unamendable--it is take it or leave it. That would be problematic."" While again I understand the desire for us to move as swiftly as possible, I reiterate that I think it is better for us to legislate in the round, taking all of the subject matter into consideration. Some matters have not even been mentioned in this debate, such as what we do about the copyright that pertains to AI-created material. Should that material have any protection, or no protection? Should it follow the person who created the AI large language model, or should it stick with the person who asked the AI large language model the question?"
"I thank the hon. Gentleman for the tone in which he has asked his questions and for his support for armed forces personnel. It is important at this time that this House sends a united message that we will protect our people wherever they are in the world, but especially those serving to keep us safe and to keep our allies safe in the middle east. On the hon. Gentleman's questions, I agree with him. I expect strong consequences for those responsible for the damage to our RAF Voyager aircraft at Brize Norton. The investigation is proceeding. A number of investigations are under way, including the one commissioned by the Defence Secretary to look into what happened at Brize Norton and to learn the lessons. I can already report that improvements at the point of entry have been made at Brize Norton. There are also investigations to look at what lessons can be applied across UK military estates in the UK and overseas. I know that the hon. Gentleman, like me, has a strong interest in drones, and he is right to pursue questions around our counter-unmanned aircraft system activities. Since he asked me that question a number of months ago,  we have published the strategic defence review, within which we outlined how we are looking to expand and roll out faster the deployment of the DragonFire directed energy weapon system. It will now feature in a funded programme on four of the Royal Navy destroyers. That will be a testbed for the technology, which we believe has wider applications, including against drones elsewhere across the defence estate. I can confirm that in relation to the RAF Voyagers, the activities of the RAF were unaffected, because we were able to move assets to backfill those roles. One of the key things about having an agile air force is that we can do that. The investigation of the damage done to the aircraft by the people who penetrated the security is ongoing, and I will report when it has been firmed up more. It is right that we give Counter Terrorism Policing the space that will allow them to conduct their investigation of the incident at Brize Norton, and the hon. Gentleman will understand why I will not be able to provide a running commentary on that. As for the deployment of RAF Typhoons to the region, we currently have about 14 at RAF Akrotiri, and the Prime Minister has made it very clear that should further resources be required, we will not hesitate to roll them forward. The hon. Gentleman asked about the position regarding the United States strikes. The United Kingdom did not participate in them, and the UK and the US have a shared ambition that a nuclear bomb should not be held by the Iranian regime."
"I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger), the sponsor of the bill."
What steps he is taking to ensure that veterans receive adequate support after leaving the armed forces
"Mr. Chair, in the main estimates, the government has allocated $9 billion for infrastructure. How much of this is allocated for new roads?"
"With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the events at Glastonbury over the weekend. Members of Parliament will have seen, as I have, the appalling and unacceptable scenes at Glastonbury on Saturday, where chants of ""death to the IDF"" and ""river to the sea"" among others were broadcast to the nation. I have been in touch with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary as to whether there has been any criminal offence committed. The House will know that decisions relating to specific cases are an operational matter for the police. Avon and Somerset police has confirmed that video evidence is being assessed by officers to determine whether any offences may have been committed. It just announced in the last few minutes that that is now taking the form of a criminal investigation. As I hope hon. Members will appreciate, therefore, it would not be appropriate for the Government to comment on an ongoing investigation at this stage, but let me be clear that the Government will not tolerate antisemitism, which has no place in our society. It is a poison and a cancer that must be rooted out, and we will be relentless in our work to do so. The Government work closely with the police and community partners to ensure the safety and security of Jewish communities. We will continue to do so following the enormous impact that these events have had on them over the weekend. Let me turn to the role of the BBC. On Saturday afternoon, just after the broadcast, I called the director general to ask for an explanation and what immediate steps the BBC leadership intended to take. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, it is essential that the BBC explains how these scenes came to be broadcast. The BBC has rightly apologised and took the immediate decision not to put this content on iPlayer. I welcome that. However, key outstanding questions remain, including: why the performance was broadcast live given concerns regarding other acts in the weeks preceding the festival; why the feed was not immediately cut when the chants of ""death to the IDF"" began; and what due diligence was done prior to the decision to broadcast this particular act to the nation. I expect answers to those questions without delay. I have made that view clear to the BBC leadership, and I will update the House as soon as I can. Over the weekend and this morning, I have also had conversations with members of the Jewish community, including those who were present at Glastonbury. They have raised a number of concerns about imagery and slogans that were on display at the festival over the weekend, which I am told led them to establish their own safe space at the festival. As a Government, we take that incredibly seriously. We are urgently looking into the specifics of those alarming reports and reaching out to the festival organisers. Finally, I want to be clear about the Government's role. As a Government, we strongly support freedom of expression, and as Culture Secretary I will robustly defend the independence of our broadcasters and the right to artistic expression, but we do not accept that incitement to violence, hate speech or antisemitism  is art. There is a clear difference between speaking out for Palestine, which is the right of everybody in this House and everybody in our country, and antisemitism, which is not and never will be. When the rights and safety of people and communities are at risk and when our national broadcaster fails to uphold its own standards, we will intervene. In the coming days, I will be having further conversations with the BBC and festival organisers to ensure that lessons are learned and action is taken."
"The Conservatives left a PS22 billion black hole that we had to fill, and that is why we took the right decisions. We have stabilised the economy, which is why we have seen four interest rate cuts. We have committed to the triple lock, which the Opposition say is unsustainable--that is PS470 for most pensioners--and we have had good quarter 1 growth. Three weeks ago, I said that I wanted more pensioners to be eligible for the winter fuel payment. I am really pleased that we set out the threshold and the certainty that is needed. The right hon. Lady says that I do not want to talk about our record, but what about three trade deals, record investment, free school meals, breakfast clubs, social and affordable housing, the defence review, Sizewell--we could go on all morning, but the Chancellor will say even more in a minute. At the weekend, the right hon. Lady said that she would be getting better in the role. She could start by apologising for the Liz Truss Budget; that would be better."
"I thank my hon. Friend for his commitment to these issues. I will not add to the answers on recognition that I have already given, nor will I speculate further on where future sanctions might be targeted."
I reserve the balance of my time.
"I rise today to recognize and celebrate an extraordinary achievement by a remarkable individual from my district, Chris Williams, a dedicated Assistant Coach for the Walter H. Dyett High School for the Arts boys' basketball team, the Eagles. This team achieved a historic victory, winning the 2024-2025 Illinois High School Association (IHSA) Class 2A State Championship with a decisive 52-41 win over Althoff Catholic High School on March 15, 2025. This championship is more than just a win on the court; it is a profound testament to the resilience, determination, and unity of the Dyett High School community and the vibrant Bronzeville neighborhood. A decade ago, Dyett faced the threat of closure, but through powerful community advocacy and unwavering commitment, its doors remained open. Today, the Eagles' triumph, shaped significantly by the guidance and mentorship of coaches like Chris Williams, symbolizes the incredible potential that flourishes when a community invests in its youth and its institutions. Assistant Coach Chris Williams, alongside Head Coach Jamaal Gill, II, provided invaluable leadership, strategic insight, and unwavering support throughout the season. His dedication to developing these young athletes, both on and off the court, was instrumental in fostering the skill, discipline, and teamwork that led to this historic victory. His hard work and commitment were integral to the team's success, culminating in this well-deserved championship that brings immense pride and joy to the school, the players, their families, and the entire community. Mr. Speaker, Chris William's contribution to the Dyett Eagles' journey from near closure to state champions is an inspiring narrative for us all. It underscores the critical importance of dedicated educators and mentors in supporting our public schools and empowering young people to achieve their fullest potential. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Assistant Coach Chris Williams and the entire Dyett High School boys' basketball team on their momentous achievement and honoring them for the inspiration they provide to communities across our Nation."
"I warmly welcome this ambitious and exciting industrial strategy from my right hon. Friend. Aligning vocational and technical training to the skills our industries need is plain common sense. However, in my constituency businesses often tell me that they cannot access the skills and workers they need, and young people and those retraining tell me that they cannot access the courses they need. Has the Department spoken with the Scottish Government in preparation for launching the strategy today?"
"I am sorry to disappoint the right hon. Lady, but there are 500,000 more jobs in Britain since the last general election. Business confidence is going up."
"Order. We have a hard stop at 2.56 pm, and I know that the Minister will wish, with the leave of the House, to respond to some of the questions that have been asked. Mr Wishart, you have several minutes, but please do not go all the way to 2.56 pm."
May I congratulate the Foreign Secretary and Chief Minister Fabian Picardo on getting this landmark agreement over the line? The agreement further cements Gibraltar's place as an integral part of the British family. Will the Foreign Secretary confirm to the House what further measures he is taking to strengthen relationships with the overseas territories?
"London boroughs are collectively facing a funding shortfall of at least PS500 million for the current financial year. Despite that, the money allocated to local authorities in London by the Government's spending review fell 35% short of the amount requested by London councils. Under the Government's planned changes to local authority funding, the two councils in my constituency--Richmond and Kingston--are set to lose out even more, while the cost of funding local services continues to rise. Is it the Government's policy that London residents should continue to receive ever-increasing council tax bills, while their local authorities have less and less money to spend?"
"What my hon. Friend describes is how health services in Scotland are utterly broken under the SNP, whether it is people waiting too long for mental health support in his constituency, or the Wishaw neonatal unit in Hamilton, which the SNP is threatening to downgrade. In 2021, the SNP Government said they would recruit 1,000 more community mental health workers. They utterly failed to do so. If they had a plan to fix Scotland's NHS, they would have done it by now. Scotland needs a change of direction."
Will the Minister give way?
I refer the hon. Gentleman to paragraph 2.13 of the ministerial code.
"I thank the hon. Lady for her kind words about the amendment and the work that my colleagues are doing. My only point is that the final paragraph under subsection (7) of new clause 4 would allow such labelling ""where the final significant production process occurred in the UK"", but that is one of the things that we are trying to clamp down on. In ceramic production, products that are bisque fired outside the UK then brought into the UK for gloss firing are passed off as being made in the UK. We argue that this should not be the case; the full process, from clay to table, should take place in the UK. While I have absolute sympathy with her on her new clause, that subsection unfortunately would not address the issue--in fact, it could do further damage to our industry. If she is happy to, we could discuss that outside this place. I am sure that there are areas of commonality, on which we could work together."
"Mr. Chair, I will be splitting my time with the Minister of Transport . If I may, I will give a bit of background. Having gone through the last federal election, as I indicated previously, I want to be very sensitive to what was being said at the doors and amplify what I heard every day of the campaign. It was genuine concern over the issue of President Donald Trump and his threat of tariffs, the impacts on trade, and what we would do in Ottawa to respond to that threat. I am really grateful. We had elected a leader of the Liberal Party prior to the federal election, who today is the Prime Minister , with an incredible background. I found it interesting that he was appointed to be the governor of the Bank of Canada by Stephen Harper. He was then the governor of the Bank of England and dealt with the Brexit issue. As a Prime Minister, he fully understands how the economy works. Today, not only do we have him as our Prime Minister , but we have one of the most able-minded individuals in the Minister of Transport , who has a comprehensive understanding of the importance of trade and the impact that it has on Canadians. On election night, it was very gratifying to see the results. I was quite satisfied. It reaffirmed to me and to many others that we have the right Prime Minister and the right government to take on the issues before us. It was so encouraging that shortly after the election, arrangements were made to meet with the premiers in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. It made me reflect on when we talked about building a strong Canada. Back in 1994, Paul Edwards was the leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party. I say that because at the time of the provincial election and leading into it, he talked a great deal about prairie integration or prairie co-operation, believing that the Prairies would be stronger and healthier if they could break down some of the barriers between provincial boundaries. Over the years, I have heard on many different occasions about interprovincial trade, and it was nice to get a dollar figure put to it. It is a significant amount of money. I truly believe that this crisis situation, the President Trump threat, has unified Canadians. Having been a parliamentarian now for over 35 years, I am convinced that an opportunity has arisen as a direct result of that. We see that Canadians in different ways have spoken to the issue. They have done that by cancelling trips to the United States, by shopping and looking for made-in-Canada products and by avoiding products that are made in the U.S. They want to make a statement, much as they did on April 28. The statement was not just for the Liberal members of Parliament. It was for all members of Parliament, all political parties. The statement was that it is time we put Canadian interests first and foremost when dealing with this issue, and I believe the first ministers' conference embodied the wishes and desires of what the citizens are saying. I listened to the Minister of Transport 's opening remarks on the issue. She talked about how the provinces are bringing down some of the provincial barriers to accommodate additional trading opportunities. I think back to 1994 when Paul Edwards said that nurses graduating from the University of Saskatchewan, which I believe is located in Saskatoon, should be able to practise throughout the Prairies. I believe Paul Edwards was right back then, and it needs to be amplified because it should not just apply to the prairie provinces, as clearly spoken to in the Minister of Transport's comments. I am a big fan of the Red Seal program. It provides opportunities for Canadians, no matter where they live, to use the skill sets they have acquired through post-secondary education and the practical training they got. Men and women have benefited tremendously from that particular program. We have an opportunity to look at ways to continue to take down some of those barriers. I like using specific examples. When I think of a labour barrier, I think of an occupation where one partner in a couple has to relocate to another provincial jurisdiction and it ends up dividing the family. Often, it is for a short term, but it might cause one partner to have to give up a career. These are the types of things that I believe we have the opportunity to encourage. Many things that take place are about provincial barriers. That is why it is not just about what Ottawa needs to do. It is about demonstrating leadership on the issue, bringing people together, building a consensus and taking actions where we can. I believe that under the Prime Minister , we have the right leadership that has the ability to bring people together. All one needs to do is reflect on what took place in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Trade matters. It is absolutely critical that we get this thing right. I often talk about Manitoba's pork industry. It creates 10,000-plus direct jobs, not to mention the indirect jobs. I remember taking a tour at the Maple Leaf plant on Lagimodiere Boulevard in Winnipeg, and it was interesting. As I was watching all this bacon being produced, I was told that half the bacon consumed in Canada was being produced on Lagimodiere. It is really encouraging. As a government, we have had a two-pronged approach. One is to look at ways we can take down barriers in Canada so that companies, small or big, have more opportunity to maintain and hopefully expand opportunities, creating more jobs. Where we can, we can provide support for those companies so they might be able to look at alternatives, exporting beyond the United States, such as to the Philippines. In December, I was in the Philippines, and we had exploratory trade discussions so we can achieve a trade agreement. These are the types of initiatives that are going to protect the interests of Canadians and at the same time build the economy, a Canada strong economy for all Canadians. That is why we need to take the types of proactive measures that the Prime Minister and this government have taken in a matter of weeks."
"I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Members' Financial Interests. I understand that Ministers are focused on wider marriage reform, but there is a much quicker and simpler process by which to enable humanist marriages, which is to act on the High Court ruling of 2020 that the current law is discriminatory. Will Ministers therefore lay an order so that humanist couples and celebrants can have legal recognition for their ceremonies in line with their beliefs, the same as their religious counterparts?"
"I welcome my right hon. Friend's focus on building up our armed forces in this more uncertain world, but is it not also vital for our national security that we focus on preventing conflict? Bringing sides together to negotiate and mediate can stop conflict spilling over and allow our armed forces to focus on the serious threats he has identified in the national security strategy. It is for that reason that former military chiefs, heads of the Security Service and Select Committee Chairs last week wrote a letter to  the PM calling for investment in peacebuilding and conflict prevention. Will the Minister commit to using all the tools in our kitbag, including peacebuilding and conflict prevention, to keep our citizens safe?"
"My hon. Friend characteristically makes an important point. I am sure the Minister heard and will consider it. We commented on deep-sea mining in marine protected areas in our report. The film ""Ocean"" demonstrated how much we are already starting to learn, and the vastness of our knowledge gap in this area. My hon. Friend is right that we must continue to invest. The report talks about making sure that we have better data and information, and making sure that, on a global basis, we do not allow further degradation of this crucial ecosystem."
"Mr. Speaker, the canola industry is very important to this government. That is why, today, I met with leaders from the canola industry. I was also in Paris last week, where I sat down with China's minister of commerce, Wang Wentao, to work through some of these issues."
"I congratulate the hon. Member on securing the debate. I spoke to her beforehand to ascertain her focus, which is clearly on the McCloud remedy. The McCloud remedy will have implications on tax for some members, with some needing to pay more tax--she has outlined three--and others being entitled to a refund. My constituents in Strangford are experiencing the same issue as those in Edinburgh West and are in a similar position of uncertainty. Does she agree that discussion with financial advisers is essential, and for those who do not have access to financial advisers, the employer--the national health service, in the case of my constituents--must provide workshops to ensure that workers can understand what their choice will mean in reality?"
"Mr. Speaker, as I walked door to door in Vancouver Quadra, a riding that is very clued into the environment, and as I went to my children's high school and talked to them, people told me that the number one thing that drives their anxiety for the future is climate change and what they are going to inherit. We want to ensure that we leave them with a planet where there is cleaner air and where they can go on the water to fish and do what they want. These are the things I committed to for my constituents."
I send a cloture motion to the desk.
"Certainly, Mr. Speaker, I would share the desire to want to focus on regulatory reform. I would like to hear more from all members on this side of the House on some of those pieces. We have heard a lot about the oil and gas sector. The government is signalling its desire to drive and build big natural energy projects across the country, whether conventional oil and gas or renewable in different types of forms. I want to bring the House back to some air of reality. Perhaps the hon. member did not like some of the ways in which the government did speak about the oil and gas sector, but it is important to recognize that the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and Reuters both talk about the fact that oil and gas production actually increased over the last 10 years. I will remind the hon. member that it was this government that built a pipeline to tidewater. Under Harper, there was no pipeline built. Can we bring this back? Would the member at least recognize that there has been an increase in oil and gas production in this country in the last 10 years? It is important to at least recognize facts and not just conjecture here in the House."
"I declare the amendment defeated. The next question is on the main motion. If a member participating in person wishes that the motion be carried or carried on division, or if a member of a recognized party participating in person wishes to request a recorded division, I would invite them to rise and indicate it to the Chair. The hon. chief government whip."
"Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for very moving speech, since he hails from the province that has declared a state of emergency. He said that the provinces and Canada may not have enough equipment to deal with the increasing number of natural disasters. He said that Manitoba will even need international aid. There is talk of getting reinforcements from Mexico, Australia and even Costa Rica to help our forest firefighters. Does he think it is time for the provinces and Canada to get everything they need and for us to build all the aircraft we need right here so we can deal with current and future natural disasters?"
"Mr. Chair, to the minister, why is it important for Canadians to support nation-building projects like transportation infrastructure, and how do these projects help bring us closer together as a country? Throughout Canada's history, major infrastructure undertakings like the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the Trans-Canada Highway and our network of airports and ports have played a vital role in uniting a geographically vast and diverse nation. In today's context, as we face new challenges related to population growth, climate change, economic competitiveness and regional disparities, how can investments in modern transportation infrastructure, like high-speed rail, expanded transit systems, improved highways and integrated ports, serve as the next generation of nation-building efforts? How do these projects not only improve physical connectivity, but also promote economic inclusivity, social cohesion and a shared sense of national purpose across provinces and territories? How can Canadians, through public engagement and support, help ensure that these transformative projects reflect our collective values and long-term vision for a stronger and more connected Canada?"
"I simply say to the right hon. Gentleman, with all respect, that there is a convention in our country about the very important role that Attorneys General play in our Government. They are able to give the Government advice when asked for it; that happens under all Governments. I do not really recognise the caricature that I have heard or some of the reports. I want to make it crystal clear that we were not involved in this action and therefore some of what is being said is wholly beyond the pale."
"Mr. Speaker, I think the five criteria that are in the bill, and I commend them, but I am not going to read them back into the record right now, are really what nation building is all about. If we get these five criteria right, not only for the portfolio of projects that arise from the bill and that are directly nominated through the bill, but also those that are more generally the kind of economic resurgence that I hope we can see east to west, with that imaginative, creative investment, that would create a real and important framework. There is a real stress on indigenous benefit and participation. There is a real stress on meeting our climate objectives. There is a stress on achieving our economic targets from coast to coast."
"I absolutely agree, and that is one reason why the Bill has been introduced. We absolutely need to keep up to date with developments in the online marketplace world, which is why we have introduced this legislation. It is not, as has been suggested, an unbridled use of powers; it sets out a clear set of principles and provides for the use of the affirmative procedure in most cases. There are already a number of regulations that will be transposed as they stand--there are about 2,500 pages of product regulations, including to do with noise levels emitted from certain types of machinery and the ergonomic design of personal protective equipment. Increasing the list of regulations subject to the affirmative procedure to cover such matters risks miring Parliament in a level of technicality that I think only my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash could follow. I do not think that is a good use of parliamentary time, and I believe the Opposition used to think that too, which is why the powers in the Consumer Protection Act 1987, which is similar to what we are dealing with today, remained in place under successive Governments. I will deal now with new clause 15, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow. She raised some important points, and I thank her for setting out the rationale behind her new clause so clearly. First, I reassure the House that we are not looking at the same level of regulatory change that was necessitated when we left the EU. We anticipate no more than half a dozen uses of the powers a year. That is because the fundamentals of the regulatory framework are already in UK law--thousands of pages, as I have referred to, and many of those provisions have been through previous scrutiny processes. The majority of future changes using the power in the Bill will be smaller and technical. I recognise the concerns raised, though. When we were a member of the EU, directives enacting major regulatory changes were regularly transposed into UK law using the negative procedure. Our Bill contains many more safeguards than were in place before, meaning that the affirmative procedure will be used far more often, as I have set out. Careful consideration was given in the development of the powers to ensure that we struck the right balance between good use of parliamentary time and the processing of highly technical changes. We listened to the concerns raised by members of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and went further, broadening the areas requiring scrutiny, as I have set out. As Lord Pannick said, the practical reality is that technical regulations of the breadth and complexity that will be produced cannot sensibly be enacted by primary legislation. If we used primary legislation every time we wanted to do something on product safety, we would have little time for anything else. However, to provide maximum transparency in this space, we also published a code of conduct setting out the statutory and non-statutory guardrails in place before regulations can be made. That included a statement on how we will engage and consult with a wide range of stakeholders to ensure that their views are considered. We will continue to review and update the code of conduct, and of course we will be happy to take suggestions on how we can be clearer about Parliament's role in the scrutiny of regulations. Given those assurances, I believe we have struck the right balance between scrutiny, the appropriate use of parliamentary time and the flexibility needed to keep our product and metrology regulations up to date. I hope that gives my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow some reassurances."
My hon. Friend raises the really important issue of empty listed buildings and how they could be brought back into use and made better use of. I will absolutely ensure that a Minister gives him a full reply.
"Mr. Speaker, while I am a member from downtown Toronto, I care just as much about what is happening in our country as others do. Not only do I proudly represent Davenport, but I represent all Canadians. I do everything in my power to make the best decisions I can for this country, so I absolutely care about the wildfires that are under way. I am very proud to be a part of the important debate and discussion this evening. I disagree completely with the member opposite. As I mentioned earlier, I am very proud of the Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience and very proud of the Minister of Indigenous Services , both of whom spoke earlier. They talked about how they have been on top of dealing with all the wildfire responses and requests. We have addressed these issues urgently. We have worked in coordination with all levels of government, with indigenous people and with the non-profit organizations that are so important."
"I can. My hon. Friend plays an important part in debates in this House, including on the Defence Committee. She recognises that, as we can see from Ukraine, it is the nations that are able to bring together the rapid innovation in new technology with the hardware of established weaponry and platforms that will have the combat edge in the future. I am determined that Britain will be at the leading edge of innovation in NATO, that our forces will be better equipped in the future, and that we will reform and rebuild our British industry to equip them for exactly that."
"Mr. Speaker, again, it is too cute by half to try to separate out the bigger picture with the smaller picture in Bill C-5 and what it attempts to do. The Liberals cannot get this economy built by saying one thing today and then, in two to five years, taking it back, which Bill C-5 attempts to do. Repealing Bill C-69 , Bill C-48 and the industrial carbon tax, those are the real answers that last beyond two to five years, when the Liberal government may take the convenient action of just pulling Bill C-5 and having us back in uncertainty."
"The right hon. Gentleman is right to highlight the issue of low take-up of pension credit and he refers to the figure of more than 700,000 pensioners,  which unfortunately was true under the last Government. We have seen unprecedented levels of pension credit applications over the past year because of the campaign by the Government and by hon. Members from all parties. Those applications are very welcome, but I agree that we need to keep up the momentum. In the short-term, we are writing to all new housing benefits claimants who we think could be eligible for pension credit and encouraging them to apply; we are engaging in new research about what has worked in the drive for pension credit take-up, which largely seems to be awareness of the benefit; and we are looking at better data sharing with local authorities and across central Government Departments, including between the Department for Work and Pensions and His Majesty's Revenue and Customs."
What discussions he has had with the Scottish Government on support for the higher education sector in Scotland
Will the hon. Lady give way?
"Mr. Chair, let us not pass the buck. Let us take responsibility for actions. As mayor of Vancouver, he raised taxes by 141%; home prices shot up 149%, and overdoses went up 600%. Given this information, how can Canadians trust the minister to be in charge of anything that he does in housing?"
Order.
"Mr. Chair, it is a regulation that sets out clear targets for the sale of EVs and—"
"I will speak to the motion and specifically to the amendment in my name on the Order Paper. As the Leader of the House has said, successive Administrations, in collaboration with the House, have supported across this Chamber the development of the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme. It was initiated in 2017 under the then Conservative Government, and it has always been developed on a collaborative and cross-party basis. In that context, it is surprising, disappointing and a pity that the Government should table a motion on the business of the House when it has not been agreed in that collaborative and cross-party way. Indeed, they are whipping their own Members; that is highly unusual for a motion on the business of the House. Our position has always been that these matters should be worked through together, through the usual channels and with other senior bodies of the House in a spirit of consensus. In that spirit, I will not press the amendment in my name to a vote."
"Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Prime Minister and the premiers agreed to work together to accelerate major projects in order to build a strong, resilient and united Canada. A Conservative premier, Premier Ford, said, “This has been the best meeting...in 10 years.” Canada's new government will fast-track projects of national interest and guarantee decisions within two years, while respecting indigenous rights and the duty to consult. There is no question that this government will make Canada an energy superpower. I hope the member will get on board."
"I thank the Minister and the 15 Members from across the country who have taken part in the debate, which shows the value we place on our local authorities. For far too long, our local councils have not always got the recognition they deserve, but they are the first line of defence for all our constituents, and it is right that they are properly funded to carry out this vital work. The Minister outlined some of the key areas where the Government are making big changes, and it is important that we continue to press him on those key areas and ask these difficult questions--not because we want to, but because we see this day in, day out in our inboxes, and it is vital that we address it. We do not want any more councils declaring bankruptcy, we do not want any more section 114 notices being issued, and we do not want any more young people tragically losing their life because of the temporary accommodation they are living in. It is important that we help the Government in their ambition to build the homes we need. The PS39 billion outlined is a step in the right direction. Our cross-party Select Committee will continue to ask the Government these questions, because we believe that every single person across the country deserves a safe, secure home that they can call their own. Question deferred until tomorrow at Seven o'clock (Standing Order No"
"Mr. Chair, Vancouver's price-to-income ratio doubled, going from 6:1 to 13:1, when the minister was the mayor of Vancouver. Does he think that record is going to earn him the respect of Canada's mayors?"
"Mr. Chair, I am just looking for the number."
"One of the 180 events that the Minister mentioned will be Armed Forces Day in Andover, which I will attend on Saturday. As the Minister knows, Andover is home to the Army's land forces headquarters. Will he reflect on the importance of the work of celebrating the armed forces in the communities that physically embrace their headquarters, camps and residences, to sustain that connection between the non-uniformed civilian population and those who protect them on a daily basis?"
I must interrupt the member because there is a problem with the interpretation. It seems to be working now. The hon. member for Charlesbourg—Haute‑Saint‑Charles may start over from the beginning.
"Mr. Chair, “build Canada homes” is not specifically in the infrastructure and housing estimates at this stage."
"The Leader of the House will be well aware that the global ocean treaty has still not had its passage through the House. With the first ever ocean conference of the parties coming up quickly, next year, will she confirm when the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction agreement will be brought forward for ratification?"
This Labour Government are giving real-terms increases in spending to local authorities every year. Compare that with the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Administration from 2010 to 2015 that cut real spending by 2.9% every year. I am much happier to stand on my record as Chancellor than I would be to stand on what the Liberal Democrats did when they had a chance at being in government.
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind my colleague, the new member for Cardigan, that the throne speech made no mention of the fishing industry other than the commitment to turn 30% of the ocean into marine parks by 2030. The new Liberal direction with respect to the fishing industry is identical to the direction of the Trudeau era. The Prime Minister is more concerned with meeting United Nations goals and satisfying NGOs than with supporting our fishing industry. Does the member for Cardigan agree with his leader that it is more important to maintain commitments to the United Nations, or is it more important to support coastal economies like those in his own riding?"
"Mr. Speaker, I would love to see Bill C-69 and Bill C-48 repealed."
"I have brought glasses to see if I can find an ounce of credibility in the SNP's candidate in Hamilton for voting against that PS8 million. The SNP candidate is a councillor from Cambuslang who stood for election twice in Rutherglen, sought selection in Shettleston and then voted against PS8 million for the Hamilton town centre before seeking selection there. In Scotland, we are allowed to elect councillors with a single transferable vote; she appears to be the SNP's single transferable councillor."
"I am mindful of what you say, Madam Deputy Speaker, and will try to keep my remarks short. I rise to speak to the amendments in my name. In this Report stage, I will briefly touch on why the Bill is so vital. It is fair to say that we all, as constituency MPs, have our frustrations with the planning system, but ultimately we must remember why this Bill matters. We are in the middle of a housing crisis. A generation of young people are spending more and more of their income on unaffordable private rents, while the dream of home ownership fades even further. We have 1.3 million households on local authority waiting lists for social housing and more than 165,000 children growing up in temporary accommodation. That figure has risen by 15% in the last year alone. I am the Chair of the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee, and our first report looked at the lives of some of the children in temporary accommodation. What we found was truly shameful. Families are living in damp, cold and mouse-infested homes. Babies are not able to crawl or learn to walk because of a lack of floor space. Most shockingly, we found that temporary accommodation has been a contributing factor in the death of at least 74 children in the past five years."
"The hon. Gentleman says that we have been here before, and we really have. I was on a primary care trust board under the last Labour Government, so I saw at first hand what good government, working with local systems, can deliver: the best patient satisfaction in the NHS's history, the lowest waiting lists, and the best access to GP and primary care. We have been here before, and that is what we will do again. From the hon. Gentleman's questions, I do not understand whether he wants more spending or less. That is what the Conservative party is still not saying; its Members stand up and ask for more, like Liberal Democrat Members, but they will not identify the means of raising that money--in fact, they oppose them. To respond to the specific question that the hon. Gentleman asked, over the coming weeks, my colleagues from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government will obviously be outlining in more detail how the spending review will fall out."
"Mr. Speaker, in British Columbia, an offender was recently sentenced to house arrest for possessing child sexual abuse and exploitation material. The victims of such deplorable materials are living a psychological life sentence. Whom do I blame for this? It is not the judge, not the prosecutor and not the defence lawyer. I blame weak Liberal laws that allow people like these to serve their sentence on the couch. Will the public safety minister recognize this injustice and stop allowing house arrest for people who watch sexual abuse of children?"
"Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Mont-Saint-Bruno—L'Acadie for his commitment to his community. Our government's celebrate Canada program supports more than 1,500 events across the country to mark National Indigenous Peoples Day, Saint‑Jean‑Baptiste Day, Canadian Multiculturalism Day, Canada Day and National Acadian Day. Concerts, cultural festivals and community gatherings are all opportunities to celebrate our diversity and to strengthen the social fabric that unites us from coast to coast to coast."
"Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear. The issue around lawful access requires modernization in Canada. We are the only Five Eyes and G7 country that does not have a lawful access regime. Every other country in our category has provisions to ensure that as new technology emerges, new techniques are available for law enforcement. Having said that, this bill does not violate the civil liberties or rights of individual Canadians. It is subject to judicial oversight. This bill was only introduced two days ago. There will be a charter statement coming, and there will be a robust debate on this issue."
"I rise today to recognize the Palmhurst Police Department for 20 years of service and dedication to public safety. Since 2005, the department's officers and telecommunicators have gone above and beyond the call of duty. They have received recognition for their Mothers Against Drunk Driving efforts, completed advanced rapid response and active-shooter training, and worked hand in hand with local, State, and Federal agencies. Their services extend beyond law enforcement and public safety. The Palmhurst Police Department is also dedicated to giving back to the community by hosting Coffee with a Cop and other events, such as organizing toy drives in partnership with the local schools and bringing neighborhoods together through their annual National Night Out. Mr. Speaker, for 20 years, they have not only protected the safety of Palmhurst but they have also brought Texans together. I thank them for their tireless work and dedication and congratulate them on 20 years of exceptional service to the people of Palmhurst and the great State of Texas."
"Mr. Chair, in my role as Minister of Public Safety, it is critically important that Canadians are protected, including Jewish Canadians."
"I think all Labour Members warmly welcome today's statement, particularly those in Scotland, where 240,000 families will benefit from PS150 off their bills this winter. That includes thousands of working families across my constituency. Does the Minister agree that this is another case of the UK Labour Government making a manifesto commitment and delivering on it?"
"Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely laughable whenever my colleagues and I hear about this brand new Liberal government. The member who just asked me the question has been here since 2015. She is not new, and 90% of that bench is all old. It is being controlled by the same Liberal operation that has been in existence since 2015. When are they finally going to start to reflect, look at themselves in the mirror and say, “We have failed Canadians. We have let them down. We failed to protect our borders. We have let repeat violent offenders in and out of the criminal justice system,” and blame themselves? Shame on them for blaming Stephen Harper and the past Conservative government, which actually cared about victims over the rights of criminals."
I call the Chair of the Transport Committee.
"Well, I can confirm that it was not Mr Speaker's 100th birthday--he falls well short of that. Weren't you 21 again this week, Mr Speaker? I join my hon. Friend in congratulating Doncaster Free Press and all our local newspapers on continuing to provide a trusted source of local news that many of our constituents rely on."
"Mr. Speaker, my question for my dear colleague from Winnipeg is this: Despite generational investments into things like the SkyTrain in my hometown of Richmond, British Columbia, and other transit operational investments that have been made, how important are electric vehicles to our province of British Columbia, for example, where there has been tremendous climate impact from wildfires and floods, as well as other climate events that have taken place there? How important is it to have people make these important choices when it comes to climate?"
"I want to focus on the benefit for Wales from the defence budget; that is what these questions are about. This spending will bring the industry more jobs, and upgrade our military homes in Wales."
"Madam Speaker, let me first congratulate my colleague opposite for his Adobe editing skills, for the type of trash that he is putting out on social media. Let me just address the issue of buyback. A serious plan to keep our communities safe starts with responsible action to keep guns off our streets. The buyback program will provide fair compensation to businesses and firearm owners in possession of prohibited firearms that are otherwise unusable or unsellable. The first phase allows gun stores and gun dealers now holding over 10,000 guns that are now illegal—"
"I rise to honor the life of my constituent, 12-year-old Brody Jakob Holt, a beloved son, loyal friend, and admired brother. Brody's life was tragically cut short just weeks ago in an accident that has left his family and our community grieving. He was full of life, always smiling, telling jokes, and bringing joy to those around him. He loved sports, dirt bikes, learning new things, and had even dreamed of becoming President someday. Most of all, though, Brody had a servant's heart. Just days before the accident, he told his mom that he wanted to be an organ donor, and in his final act of kindness, Brody gave his heart, literally, to save the life of an 8-year-old girl. His parents raised an extraordinary young man. May his memory be a blessing and may they find comfort in knowing that Brody is watching over them from above."
"Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comment made by my colleague from Bourassa. However, I would invite him to take another look at the bill. It is very clear that a proponent will be able to submit a project to the government and that the minister responsible will be able to issue an order declaring it a project of national interest without any information being made public, without any individual being informed and without any details about the project being disclosed. This bill could even result in Canada's impact assessment law being thrown out so that the government would not have to comply with it. Why is the government putting this in a bill if it has no intention of throwing it out? I would be concerned if I were the member for Bourassa, and I look forward to speaking with him and explaining the extent of the democratic decline we are experiencing."
"I just heard the minority leader of the U.S. Senate come here to the floor to talk about energy--the cost of energy, the impact of what we are doing here legislatively with regard to energy. The minority leader's comments, I would say, were laughable, but if I had to describe them in one word, that word would be ``rubbish,'' and let me explain why. It is because this week, Senate Republicans are going to continue to point out the benefits of our comprehensive economic plan, and Americans are going to be able to see for themselves how our growth agenda delivers for them what they want, what they need, what they voted for. And they voted for safety and prosperity.  This is a 180-degree turn from the past 4 years of high prices and open borders. The Biden administration caused the worst economic disaster in our Nation since the 1970s. Democrats went on a tax-and- spend binge, and they piled job-killing regulations on the economy to the tune of over $1.8 trillion. The reckless spending and the regulatory rampage fueled the worst inflation in 40 years. So I hear him talk about energy. Prices were up across the board by 21 percent from the day Joe Biden came into office until the day he left. Energy bills climbed 31 percent as a result of the Democrat policies. Families saw their savings evaporate, families saw their credit card debt skyrocket, and families struggled to keep up. Young families were locked out of homeownership because mortgage rates continued to climb. Over 10 million illegal immigrants flooded into our Nation. Millions of these illegal immigrants were given free food, free housing, free phones, free travel, and free healthcare. The American people have had enough, and they spoke up about it, and they elected Republicans to clean up the mess. We are delivering, and under Republican leadership, America is getting back on track. Inflation is down. Grocery prices are down. Gas prices are down. Wages are up. Jobs are coming back. And consumer confidence is rising. For the first time in the history of polling, a majority of Americans say our country is headed in the right direction. That is in the history of polling. That is what the American public is saying because the state of our economy is strong. Friday's job numbers just showed more new jobs were created last month than they even expected--than the experts expected. Republicans' comprehensive plan is going to make it even stronger. Our plan cuts taxes. It targets waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption. Our plan unleashes American energy, which will continue to bring down prices. At the heart of our plan, of course, is tax relief. Republicans are going to stop a crushing $4 trillion tax increase. This is a tax increase that every Democrat wants and has promised to vote for. That would be the biggest tax increase in American history. Additionally, we are going to eliminate taxes on tips, on overtime, and on Social Security. Now, that is going to be a pay raise for hard- working Americans and for seniors. The Republican plan puts more money in Americans' wallets, pockets, and purses. Families will have more money for gas, for groceries, and for emergencies. Families will have more money to pay the rent, to pay a mortgage, and to save for their kids' education. Remember, it was Democrats who vowed to vote for a $4 trillion tax increase. They actually said they are going to fight with everything they have to stop us from passing our bill. Our bill prevents that tax increase. How can they look at waiters, seniors, bartenders, police officers, and firefighters and admit that they voted to raise the taxes on all these hard-working Americans? And let's not forget why Democrats want to raise taxes. They want to pay for healthcare for illegal immigrants. That is what they have been doing. Over a million illegal immigrants have had healthcare paid for because of what the Democrats have been doing. Oh, and they want to subsidize electric vehicles that most people don't want, don't need, and can't afford. The question is simple: Are you for stopping a $4 trillion tax increase that will hit every working family in America--for the average middle-income family, $3,000 of increased taxes--or are you not for stopping that and letting it go through? While Republicans are standing with Americans families, Democrats are opposing them. But, specifically, on what the minority leader addressed this morning, which was affordable energy, let's talk about that, because Americans want, need, and voted for affordable American energy, and Americans are starting to feel that relief. Now, the Republicans are in the House, the Senate, and the White House. This Memorial Day, just a week or so ago, gas prices were 50 cents a gallon lower than they were a year ago. You know, you go fill up a vehicle in Wyoming, and you are going to save about 10 bucks. Why? Why is it better? Because Joe Biden's war on American energy is over. I will never forget when Joe Biden told members of his Cabinet to prioritize climate over energy that is affordable, available, and reliable--climate over affordable energy, the mantra of the Democrats. President Trump has taken more than 50 bold actions to unleash and unlock American energy. He has done it onshore, offshore, and in Alaska. He overturned crushing regulations on available and affordable American energy. He took the handcuffs off of our energy workers and our energy producers. I spent Friday in Laramie, WY, at the Wyoming Mining Association meeting. People from all around the State and country come together to that annual meeting. The hard-working men and women of Wyoming are celebrating the actions of President Trump. The Republicans' comprehensive economic plan unleashes American energy like never before. It opens up new Federal land and Federal waters leases to all-of-the-above energy production. That means oil and natural gas, coal, geothermal, and critical mineral production. It also refills our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Remember when Joe Biden drained the Strategic Petroleum Reserve? Why? Because gas prices were so high under his punitive administration. It was the era of massive Democrat inflation. He drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve rather than allow us to produce more American energy here at home. He drained it to a dangerously low level. It was the lowest level in over 40 years. He actually sold some of our reserves to China. That is the Democrats' approach to energy. Well, Republicans are reversing all of this. Congress is returning to fiscal sanity and energy reality. Both of those were sorely missed the last 4 years. Joe Biden's energy policies were defined by waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption. I investigated Joe Biden's Department of Energy. It was a disgrace. The Department of Energy's loan office funneled billions of dollars in taxpayer money to politically connected wind and solar projects. Specifically, one of them is a company known as Sunnova. I describe them as a very shady solar company. Sunnova was called on the carpet for scamming seniors. They targeted seniors and pressured them into signing leases that were impossible to make. Joe Biden rewarded this malicious behavior by giving them a $3 billion loan, guaranteed by the taxpayersof our country, guaranteed by each and every one of us--a $3 billion loan. Thankfully, President Trump was able to pull back part of that loan. Sunnova spent $371 million of taxpayer dollars. Well, guess what. Just yesterday, Sunnova filed for bankruptcy. Here is the article. I plan to put this into the Congressional Record, the article from the Wall Street Journal this morning, Tuesday, June 10: ``Solar Installer Sunnova Seeks Bankruptcy.'' The handwriting was already on the wall, but the arrogant, condescending, and elitist personnel of Joe Biden's Department of Energy refused to read it. Republicans need to keep investigating, and we will. We need to finish the job we have started. Today, Republicans in the Senate are unleashing affordable, reliable American energy. It will fuel our prosperity. It will benefit the entire Nation. Families will pay lower energy bills. Small businesses will be able to afford to invest and to expand. Our country will no longer depend on dictators for energy and critical minerals. America is an energy superpower. Under Republican leadership, we are acting like it. That is why I started my comments by referring to the minority leader's speech this morning about energy as ``rubbish.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article that I referred to in my speech, ``Solar Installer Sunnova Seeks Bankruptcy,'' be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  [From the Wall Street Journal, June 10, 2025]  Solar Installer Sunnova Seeks Bankruptcy  (By Jodi Xu Klein and Alicia McElhaney)  One of America's largest rooftop-solar installation businesses filed for chapter 11 on Monday, a stark illustration of the strains haunting the U.S. clean-energy sector as shifting federal policies shake investor confidence. Sunnova Energy International, once a poster child for America's residential renewable energy boom with a market value above $5 billion and more than 400,000 customers at its peak, plans to sell or wind down its assets in bankruptcy. Now a penny stock with $8.9 billion debt, Sunnova in recent months struggled to take on new business providing solar- panel installations, energy storage and financing for residential customers. Privately held Solar Mosaic, which makes loans to homeowners for solar installations, also filed bankruptcy on Friday. Both companies blamed political uncertainty around the future of solar-related tax credits, which hurt their ability to refinance debt or attract new investment, according to their filings with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. Debt defaults were building among solar companies before Sunnova and Solar Mosaic ran low on cash. Residential installers SunPower and Lumio also filed for bankruptcy last year, while Titan Solar unwound its business, leaving many residential customers with little support. Weak demand, rising interest rates and shifting government tone toward renewables have pummeled the solar energy sector, especially in recent months as Congressional leaders have moved to curtail incentives. President Trump's tax-and-spending package passed by the House sunsets certain tax credits for rooftop solar and battery storage, viewed by some analysts as a potential death knell for the solar industry. Further changes to the president's ``Big, Beautiful Bill'' are likely in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 Majority. Some senators from states benefiting from clean-energy job growth are pushing to preserve certain tax incentives, but investors have lost patience baking businesses like Sunnova with the continuing uncertainty. Sunnova started out in 2012 in Texas to provide affordable residential solar products across the U.S. by offering financing options for homeowners that couldn't afford the hefty upfront costs for installation. Customers can also lease the panels and pay monthly fees for the energy they use. After going public in 2019, the company continued to leverage a residential solar boom driven by dropping panel costs and government incentives, expanding to be a nationwide provider. Trouble in its business, which relies on borrowed capital, began to escalate in late 2023 after rising interest rates made homeowners hesitant to install new solar systems. The company reported a net loss of $448 million for 2024, and its liquidity dried up. By April 2024, its shares lost more than 93% in value from their peak in 2021. In March, Sunnova warned that even after securing a fresh $185 million loan from asset manager KKR, the company might not generate enough cash to remain operational due to weakness in the residential solar market. The loan from KKR provided a temporary life-line, but at a steep cost of 15% interest. Creditors holding roughly $2 billion in junior debt hired advisers and began restructuring talks with the company. In the following weeks, Oaktree Capital acquired more than $400 million of Sunnova's debt and has since been driving the debt negotiations, said people familiar with the matter. In an effort to quell creditor concerns, Sunnova replaced its founder and Chief Executive William J. Berger, promoting its chief operating officer Paul Mathews, who joined in 2023, to the top job. In April, Ryan Omohundro was appointed chief restructuring officer. On Friday, the company said it laid off more than half of its workforce, some 718 employees, in May. While larger solar and wind projects now face an earlier expiration of federal credits in 2028, three years ahead of schedule, the impact was far more severe for battery storage and residential solar installers like Sunnova. The company recently exited a $3 billion partial loan guarantee program it had secured from the federal government in 2023, citing falling demand for solar loans."
"I thank the gentlewoman for her excellent point. The California delegation has advanced, with Ms. Lofgren, a truly bipartisan resolution that deplores all violence because the political violence is getting out of control in America. We just had colleagues in Minnesota who were the subject of assassination attempts, and, of course, the former speaker of the Minnesota House was killed, along with her husband, and a State senator was wounded, along with his wife. We deplore all the political violence across the board, and we defend the right to speak. We look for policies from the Federal Government that will not exacerbate conflict but will reduce conflict. This resolution is far from being nonpartisan, as my distinguished colleague argues. In fact, it attacks the Governor of California, Members of Congress, California leadership, and the mainstream media. I mean, come on. We know the difference between what is a partisan, gotcha resolution and a resolution that actually attempts to unify people around common values. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"The Minister's civil servants will be proud of him. I think the point my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith) was making was that when the computer says no and the Minister knows that the computer is wrong, does he not have an obligation simply to go away and change the system?"
"The expansion of free school meals will massively help families in my constituency of Gloucester and take them out of poverty. Can the Secretary of State confirm how many more families in Gloucester will be eligible for free school meals under the Government's expansion, and what steps is she taking with the Secretary of State for Education to ensure that every child is able to access that support?"
"Mr. Chair, again, my role here tonight is not to talk about people leaving and the people who are here with an expired visa and so on, in terms of how many have left. That is completely a CBSA function, and public safety takes care—"
"Mr. Chair, as Minister of Transport, I recognize the importance of a respectful working relationship with Via Rail. Via Rail has its own management. We respect that. I also want to note that it is very important now more than ever to ensure a rail service that is accessible to all Canadians, including in the regions."
"Mr. Speaker, Quebeckers elected 44 Liberal MPs, the largest number of Liberal MPs from Quebec since 1980. These members all ran on a Liberal platform that talked about the need to act quickly to accelerate our country's growth, remove barriers between provinces and create one Canadian economy starting on page one. We are acting democratically."
"Mr. Chair, the federal government plans to divide the budget into two with operations and investments. Is that correct?"
"I join my hon. Friend in congratulating Joy Watson, and we send our best to her and her husband Tony. Like thousands of others across the country, they live with dementia every day. We thank the carers who support those living with dementia. This  Government are committed to dementia services and making sure that we have the best research and innovation on dementia. The Health Secretary will continue to keep the House updated as part of his 10-year plan."
"I declare the motion carried. Accordingly, the bill stands referred to the Standing Committee on Finance. (Bill read the second time and referred to a committee)"
"In 2026, Formula 1 will be using a fully sustainable drop-in fuel in all its cars. Does the Secretary of State agree that this provides an exciting opportunity for the UK to lead the world in using research and development from Formula 1 to support the pursuit of net zero for all motorists, and will he agree to meet me and representatives of motor sport to discuss this issue further?"
"The right hon. Gentleman and I have been discussing these energy issues for about 17 years since he was the spokesperson on this, and agreement is rare between us, so I really welcome what he says. I would say to him that these are the steps we have to go through to deliver, and they are incredibly important. To reassure him on his point about the Economy Minister in Northern Ireland, my hon. Friend the Energy Minister will be meeting them next week. We believe that this can benefit all four nations of the United Kingdom, and it is 100% our intention to make that happen."
"I am happy to speak today in support of amendment 151, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton and Wellington (Gideon Amos). Our planning system needs reform, but the approach the Government are taking in the Bill is sadly all wrong and desperately needs to be amended. Amendment 151 would compel the Secretary of State to produce a report that addresses a key principle of my concern with the current house building regime, which is good design. I am pleased that in drafting clause 93, the Government have recognised that good design goes hand in hand with sustainable development, but we need to see evidence that the houses we are getting are actually being designed and built better if we are to be confident that we are not just getting more of the same from the big developers. No one has ever told me that they want more energy-inefficient chocolate box homes, buried deep in rabbit warren estates and built to maximise developer profit. What we see too often in North Norfolk is homes that people do not like and cannot afford, but which they must queue up to buy because there is no other option. I was horrified recently to find that developers had put covenants on an entire estate to ban branded vehicles from parking on private driveways--they might as well have marketed those homes as for rich second home owners only. That is not how we want to design our communities of the future. The Government are already taking steps towards good design by accepting the provisions of the sunshine Bill, introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Max Wilkinson), which mandates solar panels on new builds. It can sometimes seem that politicians ignore good ideas if they come from Opposition parties, so I am particularly pleased that the Government have come to share the Liberal Democrats' view that having solar panels on new builds is just common sense. It is not just about the homes themselves; good design is also about how and where we build new houses. People are growing tired, rightly, of estates that are designed around car use, rather than putting public transport or walking and cycling at the heart of design. We can encourage more people to walk or use public transport if we design developments in a way that makes it easy and attractive to do just that. When we use scheme design to encourage walking and cycling rather than car use, access to public transport rather than car parks, and routes that take people to town centres rather than bypasses, we see the benefits right across society: in reduced pressure on health services, in better natural environments and in more cohesive, resilient communities. Good design will also support the second key aim that amendment 151 seeks to have the Government report on, which is tackling the climate emergency. It is  simple: a development that means fewer fossil fuel-powered cars are required to be on the roads will be better for the planet than one that does not. I do not think that people in North Norfolk are unreasonable in asking for developments to be affordable to buy or rent and sustainable and low cost to heat and power, and to feel connected to communities and not a burden on them. My constituents want to end the housing crisis, but they do not want it done through unaccountable, top-down targets. They want a design-led approach to planning and infrastructure development. I hope the Government hear our proposals to achieve that and support them today."
"As always, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. We in Stoke-on-Trent can talk at length about that pride, but I will not do so today, I promise, although we can talk about our pride that is associated with our industrial heritage. Rob Flello, who once served in this place and is now the chief executive of Ceramics UK, told me when I first met him that in Stoke-on-Trent people think we have slip in our veins--slip being the wet clay used for mould casting. That is because the ceramics industry in the city is intrinsic to who we are. It is an incredibly  important part of our heritage, but it is also a really important part of our future. We can make industrial ceramics, including those strategic ceramics that go into nuclear submarines and into joints for hips and elbows, as well as some of the technical ceramics that are needed in steel and glass making in the UK. Steel and glass cannot be made in the UK without ceramics; a refractory-grade ceramic is needed, because it can withstand heat that would ordinarily melt glass or metal. I know the Minister is well versed on this, because I have bent his ear on the subject on more occasions that he may have cared for. The ceramics sector is having a tough time, but there is hope on the horizon; I am sure that the industrial strategy will give some relief on energy costs. We are keen to encourage people to buy British-manufactured goods with pride, in order to support jobs in the localities where the industry is dominant. New clause 1 simply asks the Government to consider the merits of country of origin marking. In my constituency, there is pride in every piece made. In fact, in some factories, people who make and decorate a piece put their initials on the bottom along with the company stamp. Quite often, they can identify their own work in shops because their way of painting and applying transfers is unique to them; it becomes a fingerprint. New clause 1 encourages people to buy British, as my hon. Friends the Members for Stoke-on-Trent North (David Williams), for Stoke-on-Trent South (Dr Gardner), and for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Adam Jogee) have been doing--[Interruption.]--and the right hon. Member for Staffordshire Moorlands (Dame Karen Bradley), of course. When people go out and buy that piece of tableware or giftware, and are trying to do their bit to support our industry, if they turn it over and see ""Made in England"" or ""Made in Stoke-on-Trent"", they should have absolutely confidence that what they are buying is made in those places. New clause 1 is purely for probing purposes. It was tabled to get the Minister's attention, and his time yesterday allowed me to do that. I know it will not go much further than this, but I am grateful to the Government for their discussions with me. I know the Minister has great consideration for the importance of place in the industrial strategy, and I know from our conversations that he understands why we are pushing the ceramics line hard in Stoke-on-Trent. All I will say is that as future Bills progress, we will aim to bring is provisions back in other formats and ways, because while this Bill may not be the most appropriate place for it, there will be other opportunities for it. I hope that when that time comes, the Government may feel able to support us."
"I know from dear family members of the plight of those who suffer from arthritis and the huge impact it can have on their lives and their ability to work and live a happy and long life. We can do a huge range of things for arthritis, such as new treatments, prevention and early diagnosis, and I am sure that a Minister will want to come forward to this House with a whole strategy."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague for her hard work and her comments. One thing the member has been advocating for for many years is the issue of auto theft. While we know the numbers with respect to auto theft are coming down, whether it is in the city of Toronto or across Canada, the tools that law enforcement need have to be strengthened, and this bill would ensure that. I highlighted the issue of inspections upon export. Right now, although the legal authority to do them exists, the physical space and capacity do not exist in most ports of exit, and this is one tangible thing included in this bill that would enable the CBSA to do searches."
"I thank the Chancellor for the spending review. Local austerity is over--after being a local councillor for nearly a decade, I thank her for that. Labour-led Gravesham council has given thousands of permissions for stalled brownfield sites, many of which are needed for the homes that we need in Gravesham. I seek reassurance from the Chancellor that this can be supported by Homes England to deliver and retain council, social and truly affordable homes for our community."
"Mr. Chair, many indigenous communities face inadequate housing, water systems and transportation infrastructure. What is Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada doing to address the infrastructure gaps?"
If she will take steps to allow humanist celebrants to conduct legally binding weddings.
"In March, the Government announced that girls will no longer be placed in young offenders institutions. How will the Minister monitor the implementation of that policy, and how will he ensure the public are protected from the small number of violent girls who need to be detained?"
"Joe Biden's recent diagnosis has to some extent put prostate cancer in the spotlight of late, but it is not just him--there is Stephen Fry, Jools Holland and Robert De Niro. More than 50,000 men in the UK and 1.4 million men worldwide are diagnosed with prostate cancer yearly, which is projected to double by 2040. With one in eight men diagnosed during their life, it is the most common male cancer. More than half of those men are pre-retirement age, such as the cyclist Sir Chris Hoy, who was diagnosed at 48, but 70-plus is the most common age. My late dad was 69 when he was diagnosed. He left this earth just shy of his 79th birthday in August 2014, so he had 10 years. It is often said that men die with prostate cancer, not of it. With my dad, it spread to bone cancer, but pneumonia was actually the cause of death on the certificate. I miss him every day. Treatment for prostate cancer has improved dramatically since then. One crucial breakthrough is the development of the drug abiraterone, a Great British success story discovered and initially developed in London at the Institute of Cancer Research. It is a shining example of British science leading the world and revolutionising advanced prostate cancer care."
"I will not. Those are the words that will give powers to Ministers and to the Secretary of State to exercise his or her discretion with the most cursory of oversight from this place. Let us be absolutely clear on what we are choosing to do. Let us be absolutely clear that it is on us--it is our responsibility--to think not just for those who have options and power, and those who will not be intimidated, but for those who will be. We must think of the weak and vulnerable, to whom the Mother of the House referred, and for the communities in our country who already do not trust the health service, reject vaccination, choose not to come early for cancer diagnoses and already have the worst health outcomes. We need to think of them. Choosing to make that gap greater is not just enabling someone to access care, but actively rejecting others in our community who should seek care but will not because of the fear this will raise in their hearts. We need to think really hard about that. To those who say that there will be no change and that, ""This is it; there can be no further change,"" I say that the closest legal equivalent to this legislation is the Canadian legislation. The closest legal equivalent to us is the Canadian Parliament. The closest equivalent to the national health service is the Canadian health system. I therefore give you--"
"Madam Speaker, I would say it is because of the fear that was carefully stoked throughout the election campaign for political reasons. That fear was stoked by a team that wanted to win the election and who knew full well that seniors and the most vulnerable members of our society would be afraid..."
"Mr. Speaker, crime has been rising in my riding since the Liberals formed government, and justice is too often delayed for victims. According to the latest Owen Sound Police Service's annual report, violent crimes are up 14.6%. My communities are worried. To make matters worse, more than 10% of the cases are now exceeding the Jordan limit, delaying justice further. When will the Liberal government reverse its soft-on-crime legislation and adopt a common-sense plan to keep violent offenders behind bars and ensure victims and their families get the justice they deserve?"
"Mr. Chair, you have exceeded the number because, according to StatsCan, we have over three million people. Your target was 2.5 million people. How are you going to achieve a 500,000 reduction in the balance of this year?"
"Mr. Speaker, that is a great question. What is the role of the military when it comes to forest fires and emergencies? Our military is spread very thin, and if it is required to go somewhere else in the world and we still have this scenario going on in Canada, heaven forbid, I wonder if it can handle all that at the same time. The member also makes a good point about the ability of Canadian industry to build water bombers. We have all that technology in Canada. We just have to commit to it and say that it is something we make a priority. The government over the last few years has watched Canada burn. It has done nothing proactive to create a scenario where there are resources put in place to be there for Canadians. I would encourage the government to change that view, have a fleet in place, sit down and talk to the premiers about how this fleet will operate and be funded, and make sure Canadians are taken care of, because it is our communities and future at stake."
"Given our objective to reduce the number of children in poverty overall, I expect the impact of the child poverty strategy on children in Stroud to be positive, as all children benefit when the whole community can rely on children enjoying a good childhood. We will publish the child poverty strategy as soon as possible, but, as we have said, we are not waiting to act. The Secretary of State has listed a number of initiatives that we have already been getting on with."
"Parents with SEND children across Tewkesbury represent one of the demographics who most consistently contact me. I regularly hold surgeries with desperate parents who feel that they have nowhere left to turn. I have spoken with parents whose children have missed years of education and  whose ability to work has been diluted by the need to care for and teach their children outside the school environment. Many others have spent years awaiting diagnoses and years more acquiring an EHCP, viewing an EHCP as a kind of silver bullet, only to get their children enrolled in a school that simply does not have the additional resources to support them."
"I had meant to speak to my amendment 120 today, but that intention was superseded by the Government's movement on this, which I really welcome. It will close a loophole so that it will now be an offence to abuse an emergency worker on the grounds of race, religion or sexual orientation in somebody's private dwelling. I congratulate the Government on that."
"When an extremist minority spreads division and intimidation and now has even attacked our military, prioritising foreign regions and their interests above our own, it is an attack on our country. It is treason. The primary job of our Government is to protect the UK, so I welcome the announcement today that the Government are taking action to do just that. I was proud to celebrate Armed Forces Week at the flag raising ceremony in Runnymede this morning. Will the Minister join me in paying tribute to all our armed forces staff and the work they do for us all?"
"I thank the Minister for her response and all right hon. and hon. Members for their contributions. Wherever we stand on renewable energy, we can all agree that we must have the highest possible safety standards--that is an absolute given. From the conversations I have had with industry, clear national guidance would be widely welcomed because what we have now is not felt to be sufficient. What industry most wants is clarity, so any rules can be integrated from the start, at the design stage, when the cost impact is minimal. Regulations are clearly a live issue in many constituencies with so many applications across the country, as Members have said. However, everything is progressing in a random and unco-ordinated way. The fact that the Government do not know which Department should answer questions on the subject is revealing. I am concerned that Parliament does a weaker job of scrutiny on niche subjects like this one because they are so technical. We are currently placing part of that responsibility on the shoulders of local councillors and council officers, who cannot possibly have the relevant expertise. In her remarks, I noticed that the Minister was still using the term ""encouraged"" in relation to consulting with local fire officers. That is not enough as such consultation should be mandated and I am disappointed not to hear that there will be mandatory consultation, which is what we all want. I stress again that incidents will be rare, but a single incident can bring down an industry. I hope that the Minister will not make the same mistake that was made over cladding regulations: let us make this a tragedy that never happens. Question put and agreed to. Resolved, That this House recognises the unique challenges posed by lithium-ion fires in battery energy storage sites; and calls on the Government to bring forward enforceable national regulations for their design and construction."
"happy National Dairy Month. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of this occasion of National Dairy Month and to honor the hardworking men and women of America's dairy industry, especially those in my home State of Pennsylvania. As the Representative of Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District and as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I know firsthand the central role that dairy plays in our economy, our communities, and our health. Pennsylvania is an incredible dairy State. With more than 6,200 dairy farms, we rank second in the Nation in the number of dairy operations and eighth in milk production. These farms care for nearly one-half million dairy cows and support morethan 52,000 jobs, generating $14.7 billion annually for our State's economy. It is important that in addition to recognizing the success and strength of this industry, we also acknowledge the challenges it takes to produce the dairy products that we all know and love.  Rising costs, outdated Federal regulations, and policies that don't reflect the realities on the ground have all hurt this vital industry. That is why we must continue to fight for a modernized farm bill and for smart bipartisan policies that promote health and strengthen rural communities. In addition, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act we passed out of the House included key victories for our dairy producers. The bill contains multiple enhancements to the Dairy Margin Coverage program such as increasing tier 1 eligibility from 5 million to 6 million pounds per farm, among other items. One of those bipartisan policies is the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act which I proudly introduced alongside my colleague, Representative Kim Schrier, a pediatrician, and a bipartisan coalition in both Chambers of Congress. This bill is about returning whole and reduced fat milk to school cafeterias. It reflects updated science, addresses years of flawed Federal policy, and responds to what parents, schools, and health professionals across the country already know: Kids need access to milk that they will actually drink. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., has also voiced support for returning whole milk to school cafeterias. He recognizes its value as a nutrient-rich option that supports child development and academic success. Milk provides 13 essential nutrients, including calcium, vitamin D, and potassium. These nutrients support bone health, immune function, and long-term well-being. However, today nearly three in four school- age children are not getting their recommended daily intake of dairy. Since whole milk was removed from schools in 2012, we have seen declines in milk consumption, increased food waste, and growing concerns about childhood nutrition. This legislation is a commonsense solution that simply gives schools the option to serve whole and reduced fat milk once again. I am pleased to report that the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act has already made significant bipartisan progress. It has passed the House Committee on Education and Workforce and most recently the Senate Agriculture Committee with strong support from both sides of the aisle. With over 300 votes in the House last Congress, this bill is ready to cross the finish line. Let me be clear. This is a win for everyone involved. It supports our children's health and gives a boost to our Nation's dairy farmers who work hard every day to provide safe, nutritious products. Mr. Speaker, National Dairy Month is not just a moment of recognition. It is a call to action to stand with rural America, invest in the next generation, and ensure our food policies are rooted in science and not bureaucracy. Let's finish the work we have started. Let's pass the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act. Let's deliver for our farmers, and let's keep making American agriculture stronger, healthier, and, yes, great once again."
"Mr. Speaker, crime and drug use are getting worse in Canada. Law enforcement agencies in Ontario recently seized 1,000 pounds of cocaine and nearly half a million lethal doses of fentanyl. In my riding of Calgary McKnight, families cannot sleep at night because they worry about their homes being invaded and their cars being stolen. Meanwhile, the Liberal public safety minister does not even know his own government policies on firearms or drugs, and he is fine with releasing repeat violent criminals out into our streets. Canadians need real solutions to crime, to addiction and to the broken Liberal bail system. Our Conservative plan would ensure that repeat violent offenders are kept behind bars and that those battling addiction are given the proper care they need."
"The Minister rightly called for an independent inquiry into Israel's behaviour in denying food, medicine and vital aid to the people of Gaza. In the same spirit, would he welcome an independent inquiry into the British Government's policies in relation to F-35 jet parts, for example, because this seems to be becoming ever more mysterious? Apparently they are sold into the global supply chain, but we have no control over what happens to them; they might end up in the hands of Israel, or they might not. Is he seriously expecting the House to believe that the manufacturers of these components do not trace them, do not track them, do not label them, do not identify them? I think the Government know exactly where those parts are going and exactly that they are enabling those F-35 jets to bomb Gaza and take part in acts of genocide. Does this not deserve an independent inquiry?"
"I rise in support of merit-based hiring, especially in the Federal Government, because this administration, which has talked a lot about the evils of diversity and fired veterans left and right, is now focusing its hiring efforts exclusively on one thing, blind loyalty to the President. It is like DEI for MAGA. According to a recent memo from the Office of Personnel Management, all of the civil servant applicants will now be required to answer a series of questions explaining which of the President's executive orders are their favorites and how they will advance the President's pet projects. Now, to be fair, there are other countries that do similar loyalty tests, like North Korea, the former Soviet Union, and Iran, just to name a few, but those are authoritarian regimes. That seems to be this administration's model. I ask instead that everyone should swear loyalty to this country and not to the President, and instead of spying on Federal workers and contractors and firing ones who aren't the most blindly loyal that the best are chosen, the brightest, the most qualified people to serve our Nation, to keep us healthy, safe, and secure."
"The Minister will be aware that as we speak, the Indian High Commission in London is holding a commemoration service for those who have been lost. He also knows that my constituency of Brent West, which includes Wembley, is the epicentre for the Gujarati community--more than 30% of my constituents are originally from Gujarat. I thank him for the way in which his officials have engaged and the help that they have been able to offer, but some of my constituents have had problems. The Saiyed family--mother, father and two adult children--were travelling together. Three of the bodies have been identified, but one body has not yet been identified. I understand that the DNA testing has now been randomised, but I urge the Minister to try to do everything he can to ensure that the four bodies can have the necessary funeral arrangements celebrated together, rather than waiting longer. He is absolutely right to say that it is important that the testing process is done correctly, to avoid further problems down the line, but families are in deep distress at the moment and it is important that we send every possible help to get the DNA testing done as quickly as possible."
"Mr. Speaker, as Canada's largest air force base, with no fewer than six flying squadrons in its fold, 8 Wing CFB Trenton in my riding of Bay of Quinte is always at the forefront of our airborne military transport efforts around the world. However, it is equally important here at home in emergency assistance as it is to our citizens from coast to coast to coast. My question for the Minister of Emergency Management is this: What plans does our government have to deploy assets from CFB Trenton in this pressing emergency, and is CFB Trenton being advised to stand by to receive evacuees from areas of our north that are hard hit by the wildfires in its large cadet camp facility?"
"I do not recall mentioning the hon. Member's hon. Friend; I said that somebody saying that it was incorrect to have minimum levels of neighbourhood policing was daft, and I hold to that belief. New clauses 83 and 84 relate to rural crime. In rural areas, organised gangs target farm machinery, vehicles and GPS equipment, the cost of which soared to more than PS52 million in 2023, according to the National Farmers' Union. And I heard for myself, when I met local farmers recently, about the impact that organised fly-tipping and equipment theft have. I must applaud the work of my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall (Ben Maguire), who has been remarkably effective in pushing the Government on this area. In particular, he secured from the Home Secretary a commitment to establish a new rural and wildlife crime strategy, which of course is welcome. Liberal Democrat new clauses 83 and 84 would extend the Equipment Theft (Prevention) Act 2023 to explicitly include the theft of GPS equipment and establish a rural crime taskforce to ensure that the new rural and wildlife crime strategy can be as effective as possible. Something that is discussed often in this House is a duty of candour, and its introduction is a commitment that I welcome from this Government. Justice must be accessible to all, and survivors should never have their trauma compounded by Governments and courts that fail to uncover the truth and hold those responsible to account--as happened after the Hillsborough disaster. It continues to be deeply disappointing to see how slow this Government have been in implementing a legal duty of candour. New clause 89 would ensure that police officers must be open and honest in all investigations and oversight processes, sharing relevant information proactively and truthfully. Failure to do so would lead to misconduct charges, including serious consequences for intentional or reckless breaches. Too many police officers are struggling to access the mental health support they need, with a growing number on mental health leave as a result, so new clause 90 seeks to deal with that issue. We would require every police force to ensure that all police get proper training on how to deal with that. I will conclude by commending my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Mike Martin) on his work on new clause 43. He is dressed in the colours of all parties, representing the cross-party work he has carried out to get support for it. I urge the Government and colleagues across the House to back  that new clause and the changes that I have outlined so that our communities get the action they so urgently need."
"Madam Chair, I had a chance to meet with the CBSA union. I had a really good conversation with its members. There are about 10,000 frontline officers who currently secure our border, including the RCMP and the CBSA. Our commitment is to add 1,000 RCMP and 1,000 CBSA officers so that our border could be strengthened with those resources."
"Each military situation is different. There was a particular context at that time of ballistic missiles coming in and a particular request. We had the assets that could support, and we obviously make those assessments, as the hon. Gentleman would expect, with our regional allies depending on the circumstances and the context."
"Does the hon. Lady agree that car parks and rooftops might be a good place for solar, but this country's prime agricultural land is not?"
"I do not want to second-guess the motivations of those on the Opposition Benches, which are quite sparse for a couple of different parties, but perhaps it shows their priorities rather than anything else. Finally, many people talk to me about wanting to play their role in reducing car journeys--how wonderful would it be if they could do so by relying on their local bus network? I wholeheartedly support the passage of the Bill. My constituents and our local businesses support it because this is our chance to build a bus network that genuinely works for everyone. Will it be easy? No. But surely we can replicate the success of our international partners in building an affordable and comprehensive bus network that is fit for the 21st century."
"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, our motion to have the government table a budget this spring was passed in this House. The Liberals wanted us to approve $486 billion of spending with no plan, and $20 billion in revenue was supposed to come from the elbows-up countertariffs. However, secretly, during the election, the Prime Minister and cabinet signed an order to cancel them while telling Canadians they were still going to fight with dollar-for-dollar tariffs. Will the Prime Minister listen to Parliament, table a spring budget and explain where the extra $20 billion is going to come from?"
"The British Dental Association recently published analysis showing that the proportion of NHS funding spent on dentistry more than halved under the Conservatives, who failed to account for inflation and demand to the cost of PS1 billion. It is no wonder that we have dental deserts across much of the country. Will the Secretary of State ensure that dentistry receives its fair share of funding from the new NHS funding allocated in the spending review?"
"Madam Speaker, the carbon tax did indeed have a major impact on our region. I would like to thank my colleague for addressing the issue of French in our region, because we need to protect the French language."
The Chancellor has announced that the Government's research and development spending plans go through to 2029-30 and that our R&D budget is rising from PS13.9 billion in 2025-26 to PS15.2 billion in 2029-30--a real-terms increase--and will total PS58.5 billion over the spending review period. I am sure that that will benefit my hon. Friend's York constituency.
"My hon. Friend brings real expertise, and I listened carefully to what he had to say. We will consider those issues through the schools White Paper later this autumn. The curriculum and assessment review is also under way, and it is considering all aspects of how we can make sure that young people have access to a broad and rich curriculum. In addition, we know that poverty is a real barrier for so many children, and that is why I am delighted that this Labour Government are expanding free school meals eligibility, lifting 100,000 children out of poverty."
Let me absolutely clear: everybody involved in securing that bid deserves congratulations-- I totally agree with the hon. Gentleman.
"Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate my hon. colleague on his election. I know that we do not agree on everything, including what to do to help our society transition. How fast should we go while following the science and fighting climate change to limit things like the forest fires we are currently seeing? I would like him to talk about the possibility of a pipeline project being imposed on Quebec. I understand that your leader was proposing that the federal government could impose a pipeline project—"
"Mr. Speaker, one thing the King talked about in the Speech from the Throne is getting Canada to be an energy superpower. I am just wondering how the member opposite sees that and if Alberta will play a key part in that role."
"Mr. Chair, does the minister intend to keep that policy, yes or no?"
Agreed.
"I absolutely recognise the hon. Member's question, and I spoke to the Northern Ireland Executive earlier today. We will ensure that the Executive receive the budget adjustments in year in order to provide the same support, in line with the principle of parity under which the social security system in Northern Ireland operates. The answer is yes, that support and funding will be there."
"Mr. Speaker, it is a great honour to rise in the House today for my first speech as the elected member of Parliament for Souris—Moose Mountain. I want to share a few reflections on where I came from, whom I serve and the responsibilities we all carry as members of this chamber. I am deeply humbled to represent a region that is rooted in hard work, resilience and unshakable community spirit. First and foremost, I want to thank the people of my riding. I am here because of them. They entrusted me to be their voice in this chamber, and I will work every day to be worthy of that trust. I also want to acknowledge those who came before me. Ed Komarnicki and Robert Kitchen served this region with integrity, thoughtfulness and strength of conviction. Their example has set a high bar. I would not be here today without the support of my family. My wife, Candace, is my greatest partner and source of strength. Through every challenge, every sacrifice and every long stretch of road, she remained unwavering in her support and grace. Her belief in me never faltered, and I am endlessly grateful for her love, insight and patience. My daughter, Emma, reminds me daily of what truly matters. She is thoughtful, courageous and wise beyond her years. Her quiet encouragement has been one of the most steadying forces in my journey thus far. I am also grateful to my parents, who taught me not only to work hard but to work with purpose. They instilled in me the importance of character, integrity and perseverance. The examples they set are my guiding light. I am also thankful to the many volunteers whose dedication and sacrifice helped make this journey possible. Their belief in our cause and their tireless efforts are a humbling reminder that public service is never done alone. I was humbled to receive the highest percentage of the vote of any candidate in Canada during this election, but let me be clear: This is not about me. It is a testament to the people of Souris—Moose Mountain and their belief in our message, which is rooted in principle: a respect for hard work, for resource development, for freedom and for limited but accountable government. I grew up on a farm in Saskatchewan, where I learned early that complaining would not get me very far. If something is broken, we fix it. If something matters, we stand up and speak out. Life on the land teaches us patience, persistence and humility. It also teaches us that when we make a promise, we keep it, because our word is often the only thing we have. Those lessons have never left me. I remember when I was a teenager and a federal issue was affecting cattle prices. My father said to me, “If it matters enough to talk about, it matters enough to do something about.” I wrote a letter to our MP. That simple act of engagement was the first step in my realizing that democracy works only when people participate. It taught me that government, at its best, should be accessible and responsive, not distant and dismissive. Years later, I had the opportunity to live and work in post-Soviet Eastern Europe for nearly a decade, immersed in countries still navigating the aftermath of authoritarian rule. I was involved in international trade and economic development, working with businesses and governments as they sought to rebuild their economies and re-establish democratic norms after generations of state control. What I witnessed was both inspiring and sobering. In many of these countries, privacy had once been non-existent. Information was power, and that power had too often been abused. Surveillance was used to silence dissent. Trust in public institutions had been deeply damaged, and though democracy had arrived, the scars of its absence lingered. In some places, people were still afraid to speak freely, still hesitant to believe that the change was permanent. It was there, in conversations with small business owners, young reformers and cautious civil servants, that I saw the true cost of lost public trust. Once trust is broken, it takes generations to rebuild. When I returned to Canada, I brought those lessons home with me, into my business, my community and eventually into public service. I later had the honour of serving as a cabinet minister in Saskatchewan's provincial government, in which I was responsible for portfolios on economy, trade and innovation. That experience deepened my belief that when government works well, it creates opportunity, not barriers, for people to grow, contribute and succeed. I reflect on all of this when I consider part 4 of Bill C-4 , which addresses the question of how privacy laws apply to federal political parties. At face value, this provision seems narrowly focused. It would retroactively assert that provincial privacy laws do not apply to federal political parties, reinforcing exclusive federal jurisdiction. However, beneath this technical language lies a more profound question about the relationship between citizens and their democratic institutions. When Canadians provide their personal information to political parties, whether signing up for a newsletter, attending a town hall or simply expressing support, they are placing trust in us. They expect that information to be treated with care, confidentiality and respect. When that expectation is not met, the harm is not just legal or administrative. It is democratic. The bill may clarify federal jurisdiction, but it also takes provincial privacy commissioners out of the picture. These offices have built strong, effective systems to address complaints and hold organizations accountable. By removing that layer of oversight, we risk weakening the transparency and trust that Canadians expect and deserve. There is also the risk of reinforcing cynicism. When people see legislation rushed through Parliament, particularly as part of a broader omnibus bill, they may feel that their concerns are being managed, not addressed. When they discover that their personal data, collected for political purposes, exists outside the scrutiny applied to most other private entities in Canada, it raises a troubling double standard. We should ask ourselves what example we are setting as federal political actors. If we expect businesses, charities and provincial governments to uphold privacy rights, should we not hold ourselves to at least that same standard? I believe that we can do better. Rather than simply assert jurisdiction, we should be using this moment to create a clear, principled and enforceable privacy framework tailored to the political context, one that respects constitutional boundaries but does not sacrifice accountability. Canadians should not be asked to choose between federal clarity and democratic transparency. They deserve both. There is a real opportunity here to lead by example. As federal lawmakers, we can take a proactive approach. We can establish minimum privacy standards for political parties, standards that ensure Canadians know exactly how their data is collected, stored and used, so that the publication of a privacy policy becomes more than a symbolic check box. We must restore trust and credibility, and we must strengthen our democracy from within. While the legislation does address the jurisdictional gap, it should not be mistaken for a comprehensive solution. The real solution lies in demonstrating that political parties are willing to play by the same rules as everyone else, that we are not seeking exemption but embracing transparency. This is our chance to get it right, not just for today but for the next generation of voters, many of whom are already deeply skeptical of political institutions. Let us give them a reason to believe that we are listening and that we are willing to hold ourselves to the same standard we expect of others, one that respects constitutional boundaries but does not sacrifice accountability. Canadians should not be forced to choose between federal clarity and democratic transparency. They deserve both. This is why, as we debate legislation like this, we must ask not only whether it meets constitutional muster but also whether it strengthens public trust, whether it improves how we serve and whether it brings citizens closer to the institutions that represent them. I saw, in eastern Europe, what happens when governments stop listening, when citizens lose faith in the institutions that are meant to serve them. I can say, without hesitation, that rebuilding trust is far harder than maintaining it. Canadians deserve transparency and clarity, and they deserve to know that the people they elect are subject to rules and are not above them. I did not come to Ottawa seeking applause. I came here to do the work, to advocate for those who feel unheard, to push for common sense in public policy and to serve with humility. The people of Souris—Moose Mountain are not looking for platitudes. They are looking for leadership that understands the value of work and the weight of their worries. They deserve to know that their privacy, their voices and their values matter. As I rise from my first speech in the House, I do so not as a politician but as a proud Canadian, shaped by my prairie roots, informed by global experience and guided by the belief that government exists to serve, not to control. I will return again to that image of myself as a teenager, writing that first letter, guided by my father's words. If something matters enough to complain about, it matters enough to do something about. I intend to do something about it, not just today but every day that I have the honour to serve in the House."
"I rise today to pay tribute to a wonderful artist, educator and delightful friend Veda Louise Reed, who passed on June 3rd at the age of 91. Ms. Reed was born in Oklahoma but moved to Memphis in 1952 and attended the Memphis Academy of Art (later known as the Memphis College of Art) where she received her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1956. Her classmates included artists Dolph Smith and Henry Easterwood. She was appointed registrar of the Academy of Art that same year. Ms. Reed studied landscape painting in Britain and began exhibiting her work in 1957, both in Memphis and at the Morris Gallery in New York, where they were reviewed by The New York Times and other arts publications. Through the years. she worked mainly in oil on canvas and exhibited paintings at Southwestern at Memphis (now Rhodes College), the Brooks Memorial Art Gallery (now the Brooks Museum of Art), the Alice Bingham Galleries, the Bingham Kurts Gallery and the David Lusk Gallery, all in Memphis; in Atlanta; in Little Rock; and at the Boatman Gallery in New York. At the Memphis College of Art, she taught several art forms including painting, drawing, design, fabric design, still life, and landscapes. I have three of her paintings, including one of a sunrise that I wake up to in my Washington condominium. Years ago, she and I were paired in designing a Mark Rothko-like painting at a Brooks Museum event for a charity. She retired as a senior faculty member in 1995 when she was named professor emeritus. During her tenure, her fellow faculty members included Dorothy Sturm, Burton Callicott and Ted Faiers. Her final exhibit at the David Lusk Gallery opened in January 2024. Ms. Reed brought beauty to our world and inspired hundreds of student artists. She led a life of accomplishment and will be missed."
The hon. member.
"That is an absolutely crucial point and has been central to the work that we have done to decide on the policy. We want a system of automatic payment,  so that pensioners do not need to do anything to claim the payments, and one that is automatic for those who have incomes above PS35,000, so that they do not have to take action if they need to have the funding recouped, unless they choose to opt out. My hon. Friend is absolutely right: we need a simple system that supports pensioners."
"I completely agree with my hon. Friend. Providing over half a million children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds with a free, nutritious lunch every school day will lead to higher attainment, improved behaviour and better outcomes, including on attendance, meaning that children can get the best possible education and a chance to succeed in life."
The hon. member.
"Mr. Speaker, I like the way my colleague speaks in reality. The reality is, we know the government has forgotten about rural Canadians. The member talks about power. The Liberals have trouble doing math. In my riding, I have a lot of people still on 60-amp service; in old cottage country, it is 100-amp service. The government put out heat pumps. The reality is that we have people who cannot even get a heat pump going, let alone an electric charger that takes 30 amps. They have got an oven taking 30 amps, a dryer, 20 amps. I wonder if the member could comment a little further on our power problems."
I call the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
"I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend on those policies. Solar panels do not just soak up the sun and create clean energy; they also provide shade, protect vehicles and, frankly, over a car park they look quite good while they are doing it. We should be prioritising solar panels on the 250,000 hectares of rooftops and car parks across the country, not on our precious green spaces. Car parks are often located in energy intensive areas--  near hospitals, shopping centres and office buildings--so it makes perfect sense to generate the power right next to where it is needed."
"My hon. Friend is making an excellent speech. In particular, I commend him for the way in which he has talked about the support that relatives often give as caregivers. Will he elaborate a little further on the points he made about the need for more resources to be focused on less advantaged communities? My own experience in representing a community that has some disadvantages is that people in those communities, particularly families from ethnic minority backgrounds, need far more support."
"One of the ways in which the Secretary of State has reduced the waiting list is by turbocharging the use of the private sector since January, meaning that half a million people have been treated in irreducible spare capacity. Has that experience elicited any learnings that the Secretary of State is able to take into the wider reform agenda for the NHS?"
The hon. member.
"Mr. Speaker, I wish to state at the outset that it is always a pleasure to rise on behalf of the great residents of Brantford—Brant South—Six Nations. I also want to telegraph that I will be splitting my time with my colleague, the member for Montmorency—Charlevoix . Today we are debating our Conservative motion that, given that the Auditor General found that the ArriveCAN contractor, GC Strategies, was paid $64 million and that in many cases there is no proof that any work was completed, the House calls on the government to, one, get taxpayers their money back within 100 days of the adoption of this motion; and two, impose a lifetime contracting ban on GC Strategies, on its subsidiaries, more importantly on its founders and principal partners, Kristian Firth and Darren Anthony, and on any other entities with which those individuals are affiliated. The simple message is that Canadians want their taxpayer money back. I know that the member for Winnipeg North claims that no one in his riding spoke about ArriveCAN, but I am sure they talked about accountability, transparency and proper prudence in terms of the government's exercising prudence over taxpayer money. He will not talk about that, but that is exactly what the motion is about. If this is a déjà vu moment, and it feels like a déjà vu moment for me, it is because approximately 15 months ago I stood before your predecessor, Mr. Speaker, who was in the chair, and I gave a speech on a similar motion. It was not worded in the same fashion, but the intent was there to give the government 100 days to inform the House as to what steps it would take to get taxpayers their money back. That was a result of the Auditor General's releasing a number of damning reports. It is important to note at this point that the Liberal government, the same so-called new government with the same old players who are now saying, through the Prime Minister , that they totally accept the findings of the Auditor General, was the one that opposed the Auditor General's looking into the ArriveCAN scandal, what we call the arrive scam scandal, right from the earliest opportunity. The messaging is very clear in this. The ongoing Liberal arrive scam saga continues. It is the bad Liberal gift that just keeps on giving. Currently, the Auditor General has released a scathing audit on the top arrive scam contractor, GC Strategies. The two-person, basement-dwelling company, not a brick-and-mortar one, now under RCMP investigation for fraud, received a jaw-dropping $64 million from the Liberals since they took office. This was not the first time, as I indicated, that the Auditor General had released a report on GC Strategies. The app was designed to cost Canadians $80,000; that is what the same old Liberal government parroted in the House on numerous occasions. In her first report, the Auditor General made it clear that the cost estimate was well beyond $80,000, and in fact was approaching $60 million, but she could not be accurate. Why is that? It is because the paperwork and the shoddy accounting practices of the CBSA were such that she could not examine all pertinent documents. The Liberals defended the cost of the app in the House numerous times, and quite proudly, but now erroneously have stated that it saved thousands of lives. The truth remains that it was an app that was poorly designed, notwithstanding its price tag, that always broke down and that created countless misery and heartache for Canadians. I would dare say that not one Canadian was saved by the Liberal bureaucratic and administrative boondoggle. The government's very limited defence involves the plea that the app was developed in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic, that time was of the essence. We heard that numerous times. However, the unique circumstances and demands of the moment scarcely offer a fig leaf to cover what the Auditor General laid bare in that report. Karen Hogan said, “Overall, this audit shows a glaring disregard for basic management and contracting practices throughout ArriveCAN’s development and implementation.” She further said, “I don't believe that an emergency is a reason that all the rules are thrown out the window.” She proudly concluded that the government paid way too much for that particular app. The issue is such that the Liberal government has a responsibility, has the legal ability and, according to a government department official responsible for contracting and outsourcing, has the power to get taxpayers their money back. The official testified before a committee that when the government is frauded, they “have the ability to recover the funds from the suppliers, and it's in [their] regular practice to do so.” This should telegraph to all of my Liberal colleagues that they should stand in support of this ability to ensure taxpayers get their money back. I have since looked at a number of news articles, notwithstanding the member for Winnipeg North 's comments that no one is talking about it. Certainly, ripped from the headlines are a number of interesting stories. First, by Lorrie Goldstein, the heading is, “Ignoring contracting rules costs taxpayers billions: auditor general”. The article reads: Federal auditor general Karen Hogan on Tuesday reported widespread incompetence in the awarding of government contracts by the public service, resulting in billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money being wasted. What’s even more alarming is that everyone in the system knows it and no one is doing anything about it. Given that, what is the point of having an auditor general if every time she exposes incompetence and waste, the government pays lip service to implementing her recommendations and then goes back to doing the same things that led to the issue being investigated by the auditor general in the first place? In her latest report, this concern arises from Hogan’s deep dive into federal contracts awarded to...GCStrategies.... That was supposed to cost $80,000. I could literally speak for an hour on this. I have been involved in it for literally three years. The article continues with some of the key findings: — in 58% of the contracts examined that were awarded without tendering, federal departments failed to assess whether doing so would have resulted in lower costs to taxpayers. — in more than 80% of the contracts examined that were awarded without competition or with only one valid bid, government departments failed to verify that the fees paid did not exceed market rates. — in almost 50% of the contracts examined, federal departments couldn’t show the work was delivered, even though payments were made. — in 33% of the contracts examined, federal departments couldn’t show the firms contracted were capable of completing the work. — in 21% of the contracts examined, federal departments lacked documentation showing...security clearances for contractors working on government networks containing sensitive information. Alarmingly, those department agencies where security clearances were not obtained included National Defence, Global Affairs and the Department of Justice, three of the most important ministries that have an obligation to secure sensitive data. In essence, the Auditor General concluded that, ultimately, no recommendations were being made, because they need to follow the basic rules, which have been allowed to be not followed for literally the last 10 years, and that, simply, Canadians did not receive value for their money. In essence, I am asking every member to rise, to stand up for their constituents and ensure accountability is here."
"Over 95,000 apprenticeships are being undertaken in the health, public services and care sector, and NHS Employers and many others have raised concerns about the impact of the Government policy to cease funding for level 7 apprenticeships for those over the age of 22. Can the Minister tell us what plans are in place to ensure that the people supporting all of us and all our constituents are given essential training and support? More particularly, what discussions has she had with the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care about the impact of this decision on our NHS?"
"Resuming debate, the hon. member for Halifax."
"I absolutely accept that invitation, and I can tell the hon. Gentleman that we are already extremely involved, as is the Minister for Industry. We welcome what has happened with Airbus, but we are focusing a great deal on the RemainCo and the issues there."
"Mr. Speaker, Bill C-5 proves one thing for certain: The Liberals broke the system, and Canadians pay the price. An unprecedented $5 trillion of Canadian capital went south and into other countries, and they killed $670 billion in major natural resource projects that could have been built by Canadians with Canadian aluminum and steel for Canada's economic strength, self-reliance, security and unity. In five years alone, 16 major projects were sidelined because of them. It cost Canadians over $176 billion in lost nuclear, critical mineral mines, LNG terminals, pipelines, indigenous-led projects and energy corridors delayed or derailed by lawsuits, bureaucracy, delay and Liberal policies. Imagine how powerful and self-reliant Canada would be today. Instead, Canada ranks last in the G7 for development, and the Liberals now scramble to patch what they themselves destroyed. Bill C-5 would not fix the fundamentals. It admits failure, with hundreds of thousands of Canadian job losses and more to come, unaffordable power and fuel, and skyrocketing costs of essentials. What the Liberals have to do is what the Conservatives said all along. They should scrap Bill C-69 , Bill C-48 , the federal industrial carbon tax, the Canadian oil and gas cap and all their other antidevelopment policies and laws. Proponents today still face unclear rules, no concrete timelines, interference and limited transparency. As the transport minister said herself in committee, “we have come to a place in Canada where we have such a thicket of processes, rules and regulations...that we are unable to build with the alacrity that this moment in time requires.” It is not during just this current moment that major projects cannot get built in Canada with brisk and cheerful readiness. That has been the worsening reality of the last decade of Liberal antidevelopment laws, policies and messages. That dense, cumbersome thicket was created by the very same government that claims to be new while half the ministers are the old ones. Conservatives offer real solutions: to cut red tape, gatekeepers and taxes; to create clear rules; to attract private investment; and to fast-track major projects for the benefit of all Canadians. The place the Liberals should start is with all the projects stuck in the federal queue right now, such as the Ksi Lisims LNG project, LNG Canada phase two and Bruce Power upgrades, and they should be looking at the dedicated west coast export pipeline to serve Asian energy demand that they killed 10 years ago and indigenous-backed roads to unlock the Ring of Fire. They are in the national interest, and they are waiting for a green light. They should be on the national interest list and fast-tracked yesterday. Nevertheless, Conservatives worked in good faith with other opposition parties and with the Liberals to help improve Bill C-5 , and here I want to thank the Conservative team for all its efforts. It will be up to the Liberals to deliver on their rhetoric and to keep up all their big, but vague, promises to Canadians. It will ultimately be up to Canadians to determine whether they do, and Conservatives will hold them accountable in the meantime. Even now, Bill C-5 sets up a politically driven and determined process. Ministers will decide who goes ahead and who waits. They can even one day decide a project that they said was in the national interest earlier is no longer and remove it from the list or whatever ad hoc review a responsible minister determines. This is a problem I tried to fix: inherent uncertainty, huge powers behind closed doors and not a permanent fix or way to regulate and review projects in the sector most important to Canada's economy, imperative to help turn poverty into prosperity and to help lower emissions globally. Bill C-5 blurs the lines, just as Bill C-69 did. What is worse is that the Liberals know it. At committee, the Canada-U.S. trade minister admitted, quote, whoever puts forward these projects, be they public, private, indigenous, provincial or municipal, does not have to go through an evaluation and approvals process that could take five to six years. He admits the Liberal system takes years and delays building. It is not clear whether projects that are actually in provincial or municipal jurisdiction may end up in the Bill C-5 queue for a federal review, which would be a similar overreach problem to that in Bill C-69. The mix of public and private infrastructure should cause taxpayers to take notice too, but again the obvious first step should be to fix that whole evaluations and approvals process the minister himself says is too long. Proponents and the government itself are trapped by the red tape they imposed. Still, Bill C-5 does not fix it for everyone; it will fast-track a chosen few. At first, it did not even define “national interest”, which left every decision to the whims of cabinet and a lack of clarity for everyone involved, but Conservatives fought to require the government to define national interest with clear, specific criteria. We succeeded in adding that necessary clarity and structure to a process that started with none. Conservatives also successfully incorporated the requirement of a public list of national interest projects, with timelines, estimated costs and rationale; application of the Conflict of Interest Act to officials and proponents to prevent abuse and prevent politically connected insiders from pursuing personal profit over the public interest behind closed doors; mandatory national security reviews for hostile regimes and state-owned investments into major national interest projects to combat foreign interference and economic imperialism from adversaries and to protect Canadian sovereignty and security; a requirement for the government to fully deliver on its mandatory duty to consult and a clear map for indigenous consultation, with public reporting to build trust, earn confidence and respect indigenous rights and title so that major projects can get to yes in a good way, with minimization of predictable court challenges and delays; and annual independent reviews of project progress so all Canadians can measure the Liberals by their actions, not just their words, and hold them accountable. These amendments matter. They bring transparency, accountability, more certainty, more clarity and integrity to a bill that originally had none. However, even with these improvements, major concerns remain. Bill C-5 would still allow ministers the power to remove a project from the national interest list at any time, without notice, reason or recourse. I proposed to remove the power to take projects off the list once they make the cut, because that uncertainty may continue to push investors and builders to other countries with clearer rules and more predictability, just as the Liberals have done to Canada for the past decade. Since delay is death to major projects, Conservatives also aimed to give concrete timelines that do not actually exist in Bill C-5 , despite all the Liberals' claims about a two-year process. I proposed a one-year deadline to issue permits once a project is designated; a 90-day limit for the Governor in Council, the cabinet, to make final decisions; and a requirement to prioritize private or public-private funding to protect taxpayers, to prioritize private funding. Canada should be a place where the private sector can take big risks and build big things on its time and on its dime, not where taxpayers have to be on the hook to get anything done. The Liberals rejected those amendments. Then I brought forward an amendment to apply the Conflict of Interest Act to enforce clearer safeguards to prevent corruption and block Liberals from stacking the deck in favour of their friends. This should not be necessary, of course, but we have a Prime Minister who hides his conflicts and where he pays his taxes, and who ran to make the company Brookfield invested in all the kinds of projects that Bill C-5 would fast-track, although under the Prime Minister, it mostly invested in the U.S. and abroad. This caused a flurry and a huddle among Liberal MPs, a couple of odd questions, and then the Liberals voted against it. Thanks to Conservative pressure and support from another opposition party, we forced the government to follow its own laws designed to prevent corruption and to put the public interest ahead of partisanship. Conservatives also got limits put on cabinet to prevent it from exempting 15 foundational laws that no government should ever sidestep. All Canadians can be forgiven for wondering why the Liberals would have presented such a potentially significant law free from all of those laws in the first place. Conservatives pushed crucial amendments to ensure provincial consultation and to protect provincial jurisdiction and provincial decision-making power, because what the Liberals must show is that they can ensure big projects in federal jurisdiction can be built for Canada's economic strength, security and national unity, not meddle in others. They have to find a will, a spine, a set that they have failed to show in the past decade in order to enforce their own jurisdiction, to treat the national interest approvals according to the general advantage of Canada and to uphold legal and jurisdictional certainty so that proponents can build their projects when approvals face challenges and obstruction. Otherwise, this will all be big talk and a lot of delays without fixing the real problems, which are the antidevelopment laws and policies the Liberals themselves decided they needed this queue-jumping Bill C-5 to work around. Conservatives' work continues today, with subamendments to clarify and fix flaws. We proposed a parliamentary committee with a nongovernment Chair. No government should judge its own actions. Democratic accountability anchors this principle, so the subamendment strengthens review with independent, balanced representation across parties. Canadians expect transparency, not spectacle. They expect real checks, not blanket approval. Canada holds vast potential. Natural resources, energy and infrastructure sustain millions of jobs, fund public services, build communities and bolster global trade. Any bill for national development must reflect this reality and champion, not hinder, the sectors that drive prosperity. Canadians need an approach that does not curb ambition, repel investment or deny opportunity. Canada cannot tolerate a framework that casts resource development as a threat rather than a strength. Canada demands confidence, not caution, and momentum, not paralysis. Conservatives champion responsible resource development, independent oversight and a united Canada, and our amendments to Bill C-5 uphold those values. Conservatives believe in strong paycheques and unity through opportunity, not division and double standards through federal overreach. We believe in reconciliaction through—"
"I rise today to recognize the tireless efforts of my constituent, Tammy Myers, whose commitment to ensuring fairness in Michigan's surrogacy laws has brought about meaningful change for families across our community and state. Tammy Myers was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, which resulted in procedures that left her unable to have children. In 2021, she and her husband worked with a gestational carrier to have their twin son and daughter. They quickly found themselves facing an unimaginable challenge. Tammy was forced to adopt her own biological twins due to deeply unfair Michigan laws that failed to recognize her as the rightful parent of her children. Fueled by her personal experience, Tammy became an outspoken advocate for reforming Michigan's antiquated surrogacy laws. Through her persistence and unwavering determination, Tammy helped bring attention to a loophole in state law that left parents like her in legal limbo, forcing many individuals to jump through hoops to be recognized as their biological children's parents. Tammy's efforts were instrumental in the passage of the Michigan Family Protection Act, which provides legal support and protection for families who have children through surrogacy. Her advocacy shed light on the real-world implications of our outdated legal system and the need for reform as we continue to fight for reproductive freedom across our Nation. On behalf of Michigan's Third Congressional District, I am proud to honor Tammy Myers for her advocacy and leadership. We thank her for her tireless work in fighting for her children--Eames, Ellison, and Corryn--and the hard-working Michiganders who now have access to the essential resources they need to start a family."
"Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity on numerous occasions to raise the issue that British Columbia, Quebec and, I understand, Northwest Territories were never a part of the program itself. The Bloc members have chosen to completely ignore the issue as opposed to playing divisive politics. It was interesting that one of the member's colleagues made reference to the pipeline as an example. Manitoba, my home province, has benefited from tens of millions, going into billions, of dollars, because we are a have-not province, receiving money that comes from provinces like Alberta because of issues like the pipeline. We are being critical because there were supports for a pipeline. I wonder if the member recognizes that in a federal system, sometimes we need to support the different industries throughout the country, in all provinces, whether it is Quebec, Manitoba, B.C. or whatever it might be."
"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. If the hon. Member for Ipswich were more confident in his arguments, he might want to stand up and take part. As I was saying, it is bad energy policy, reducing our energy security while increasing the cost of energy for families and businesses. It is bad farming policy because  it puts some of our best agricultural land beyond use, and as this debate has shown, it is bad for public safety, because the Government, in their haste and zeal, want to ignore the very serious dangers these batteries bring."
"The House resumed from May 30 consideration of the motion for an address to His Majesty the King in reply to his speech at the opening of the session, and of the amendment as amended."
"Mr. Speaker, the Journal de Montréal reported today that crimes against persons in Montreal have gone up by an average of 28%. Worse yet, more than 20% of those crimes are committed in a context of domestic violence. Over the past 10 years, the Liberals lost control. This Liberal government must act quickly to keep the public safe. When will the Liberals start cracking down on crime and finally protect the victims?"
"Mr. Speaker, I am here today to speak to this bill to amend the Citizenship Act. I am here to say that it is very important to work on getting this bill through committee and the House. I look forward to the co‑operation of all parliamentarians who are working in the House to move this bill forward."
"last week, Secretary Noem ended a program that is called the Quiet Skies Program. It is a program that was well-intended when it was set up, but the Biden administration weaponized it to target its opposition, including the now-Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Quiet Skies was supposed to track American airline travelers who had prior contact with known or suspected terrorists. You can have no argument with that intent to make sure that air travel is safe, but instead it has been revealed that the Biden administration's Transportation Security Administration allegedly tracked U.S. citizens based upon nine nonsecurity-related considerations. As just one example, whistleblowers told my office, some who were merely present at a rally on January 6, 2021, with President Trump were added to the Quiet Skies' list of targeting. In another allegation, a woman was accused of invading the Capitol on January 6 and later added to the Quiet Skies. The woman was disabled and couldn't physically engage in those actions. Now, fortunately, Secretary Noem shut down Quiet Skies to end this weaponization, and that should be music to everybody's ears. In August 2024, I wrote to Biden's Transportation Security Administration questioning their abuse of this authority under this Quiet Skies Program. I did not get sufficient answers from the previous administration. I will continue my oversight to learn the full truth about the Quiet Skies Program, and I appreciate Secretary Noem and Director Gabbard's leadership as my office works with them on the oversight request."
"This Government were elected with a landmark mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade. Despite the challenges we inherited, we have recently secured a record funding settlement for the Crown Prosecution Service, which will allow it to hire more prosecutors and play its part in rebuilding a criminal justice system that truly delivers for victims."
"I thank the Minister for being so generous with his time. On that point, will he outline how the Government will decide which parliamentarians will be on the advisory group and how they will be chosen?"
"Questions and comments, the hon. member for New Tecumseth—Gwillimburg—no, Gwillimbury."
"I welcome this national security strategy. Defence begins at home, and my community plays a role in the UK's security and resilience with the HQ of Standing Joint Command in Aldershot. We need to focus as much on national resilience as on conventional military threats, so will my right hon. Friend share the work he has been doing on the national resilience strategy? How does it fit with the national security strategy that is in front of us today?"
"The Government have said throughout the passage of this legislation that it is not about the European Union, yet as the hon. and learned Member makes clear, it is only the European Union that we can align with through regulations made under it. Does that not fundamentally undermine the Government's entire argument, and show why these amendments are so vital to protect this House?"
"Mr. Chair, if the point of the question is to say that we need to make it easier for health care professionals to work across the country, I agree 1,000% ."
"Mr. Speaker, just by the structure of this bill, there is no chance there will be no trade barriers by Canada Day in interprovincial trade. I had the privilege of working on the CFTA with the members opposite. Basically, we got a whole bunch of exemptions, put them together in a package and called it a Canadian internal free trade agreement. This is something the Conservatives are not looking to repeat. We want free trade for all, for everyone. It would unleash our economies and make Canada one of the most powerful countries we could ever imagine."
I would interrupt the member briefly. The hon. chief government whip is rising on a point of order.
"Mr. Chair, the minister mentioned Roberts Bank. I want to draw to her attention, if she is unaware, to the fact that scientists have urged the government to say no as it will lead to the extinction of species."
"Mr. Speaker, I would agree with my colleague. The bill is full of very concrete, very positive measures. Can my colleague tell us about two things that he thinks are essential and should be prioritized? Can he tell us about two things that he finds interesting and would like to highlight for the House?"
"Melia, Gvaramia, Badri Japaridze, Khazaradze, Zurab Japaridze and Vashadze: all six opposition leaders arrested over the last two weeks in Georgia. What are the British Government going to do about it, and what is the message from the British Government to the Georgian people, who are suffering as a result of this huge democratic backsliding?"
"Mr. Chair, premiers Smith, Moe and Kinew have all said yes to a pipeline to Churchill. Does this mean a yes?"
"Mr. Chair, I wonder if the minister could comment on a report from the Auditor General. A federal lands initiative of $200 million was given to CMHC to be spent at an increment of $20 million a year for 4,000 units. That has subsequently been transferred over to the Department of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities, and only 309 units of the 4,000 have been built. Can the minister tell us how much of the $200 million has been disbursed to build those 309 units?"
I agree with the hon. Gentleman; the water companies--Thames Water and all the others--should of course engage with MPs who are seeking to represent the interests of their constituents. I would be very happy to approach Thames Water on his behalf to ensure that he gets the meeting he seeks.
"I thank my hon. Friend for raising this matter. The Safeguarding Minister takes this issue very seriously, and we cannot have issues relating to the criminal injuries compensation scheme being raised in court in a way that undermines victims and survivors, who have bravely shown that they are able to speak out about abuse that has haunted their lives for so long. We will look at this issue further."
"I make it a habit not to confirm the schedules of my ministerial colleagues. Of course, it is the Minister for Europe--who has responsibility for the overall licensing regime--who has appeared before my right hon. Friend's Committee. Let me be clear to the House: there is no effort to conceal our position on arms licences. We have set it out to this House on a number of occasions. The Minister for Trade, my right hon. Friend the Member for Lothian East (Mr Alexander), set out some of the numbers on Monday. We have taken exceptional measures to try to show more transparency than is usual about the arms licensing regime. We are having that discussion not just in this place, but in the  courts. There is no effort on the part of this Government to be anything other than transparent--not only with this House, but with the Israeli Government themselves--about the nature of our decisions."
"Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Toronto Police Service, Durham police, my friend who represents York Regional Police, and the OPP, for their work to dismantle an organized crime group operating in the tow truck industry. Project Yankee has resulted in the seizure of firearms and vehicles, the arrest of 20 individuals and more than 100 criminal charges, including multiple counts of conspiracy to commit murder. It is another day and another criminal organization dismantled by law enforcement. Canada's new government will always be there to protect Canadians."
"It is my duty to inform the House that a vacancy has occurred in the representation, namely Mr. Kurek, member for the electoral district of Battle River—Crowfoot, by resignation effective June 17, 2025. Pursuant to paragraph 25(1)(b) of the Parliament of Canada Act, I have addressed a warrant to the Chief Electoral Officer for the issue of a writ for the election of a member to fill this vacancy."
The hon. member.
"Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the fine member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord . This being the first substantial time I have spoken in the House, I would like to ask for a few moments to thank a bunch of people who made it happen. Number one, first and foremost, as always, is my Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. Without Him, I would not have the ability or opportunity to serve the great folks of Essex. I want to say thanks so much to my lovely wife Allison of 27 years—"
"Mr. Speaker, I know that colleagues in the House will be disappointed. I arrived at the last minute to give this speech. I am told that the first speech has unlimited time. If I had not arrived in time, colleagues could have heard the member for Winnipeg North for possibly a few weeks on this bill. My colleague from Winnipeg North is absolutely right. This commitment to one Canadian economy, to getting big projects in the national interest built quickly, was on page 1 of the Liberal platform. This should not surprise any parliamentarian. The government is in fact moving quickly on an obligation we have to Canadians."
"As the Minister will know, Gavi and the Global Fund not only provide a global vaccine programmes and programmes on saving lives from malaria and HIV, but provide us with biosecurity and jobs in the UK, not least over 500 research and development jobs and funding for the institute of tropical medicine. What assessment has he made of whether the UK is to reduce our efforts in that regard?"
"People have lived in Earsdon View in my constituency for more than 15 years, but the estate remains unadopted due to an ongoing issue between the landowner, Northumberland Estates, and the developer, Bellway, involving the securing of sewer adoption. I continue  to press all parties to resolve the problem, but how can we ensure that people are not left in this situation for decades, often paying management fees on top of council tax, and that developers deliver?"
What steps his Department is taking to provide assistance to British nationals impacted by conflict in the middle east.
"As the Secretary of State knows, my constituency of North Herefordshire is very seriously affected by water pollution in the Lugg and the Wye. I confess that I am disappointed that, in both his answers to the hon. Member for Monmouthshire (Catherine Fookes), he did not mention agricultural pollution at all. That is despite the fact that agriculture is the main source of water pollution in the country, as is shown in the report of the Independent Water Commission, which unfortunately was not allowed to look into it in any detail. I pay tribute to River Action, which this week won a court case forcing planning authorities to consider the cumulative impact of industrial agricultural development, and to Greenpeace, which last week pointed out the impact of toxic sewage sludge. Will he confirm whether he is updating the farming rules for water? Given that he has cut the budget of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs--"
The hon. member.
"I do not see how the Deputy Prime Minister has the brass neck to claim that she has the situation under control when the numbers crossing the channel this year are the highest in history. She asked about the Rwanda deterrent. She was obviously not listening to what I said earlier. The Rwanda scheme never started; indeed, illegal immigrants in Calais--[Interruption.]"
"My hon. Friend has been a vocal advocate for the Hong Kong community in his constituency and across the country. We will stand with and support members of that community; we have a long, shared history with Hong Kong, and many people from Hong Kong have made the UK their home in recent years. Again--I must emphasise this point, and I will continue to do so as questions on this come in--that is a distinct and separate issue from the planning application that will, in due course, come before Ministers in my Department."
"Mr. Speaker, do I have any sense of guilt? Hon. members on that side of the House blame Pierre, blame the convoy and blame the Conservatives. They blame everybody but themselves. If they want to say it is a new government, why not start by getting the $64 million back? That is all we are asking for, to get the $64 million back."
"Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is imposing a gag order on Bill C‑5 , which would give him the power to make decisions about energy projects by order in council, with no regard for Quebec or social licence. He is also rushing the passage of Bill C‑4 . He is appointing ministers without a mandate letter stating his intentions, and he has ended Justin Trudeau's tradition of answering all questions in question period on Wednesdays. In short, there is no debate, no transparency and as little accountability as possible. Do the Liberals really think this is what Quebeckers expect from a minority government?"
"Madam Chair, I am pleased to see that my Bloc Québécois colleague has spent enough time reading the Liberal platform for it to inspire him. I encourage him to continue his reading. Clearly, what we said was that we were going to fight these tariffs, protect our industry workers and build a strong Canada."
"Mr. Speaker, I will provide an equally clear answer: It is to fight every day. The Prime Minister is fighting, the ministers are fighting, Canada is fighting against these tariffs. I invite my colleague to join us in this historic battle. He will be able to tell his grandchildren that he did something good for the country."
"Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member bringing up the issue of labour mobility, something I have spoken about with Joe Mancinelli many times. As a professional structural engineer licensed in the province of Ontario, I can say it is a real issue for professionals to have provincial regulatory agencies and to not be able to practise across provinces. Would the member agree that the federal action on having one Canadian economy would encourage further provincial action?"
"I thank my friend for organizing this critical Special Order hour to shed light on the horrors inflicted on immigrant communities by the Trump administration. I am proud to represent the Inland Empire of southern California just east of Los Angeles. My district is home to a thriving immigrant community. It has been enriched by immigrants just like so many other communities across the country. In recent weeks, this community has been plagued by fear. Images of masked agents dragging people out of cars, using excessive force, and disappearing individuals in unmarked cars are sowing fear. We cannot allow this to continue. Make no mistake, this is all on President Trump. The President has instructed ICE to meet arbitrary deportation quotas. Their aggressive and baseless target number of 3,000 daily arrests does not require them to focus on violent offenders and criminals. Instead, mothers and fathers who have been in this country for years with no criminal record and who have raised their children in the United States are being targeted. This administration's claim that it aims to deport violent criminals is a falsehood. What we are witnessing is the erosion of due process. I have been especially troubled by the image of a landscaper, a man whose sons have served in the Marines, being punched repeatedly in the head by ICE agents this past Sunday. Is this something my Republican colleagues are proud of? That we repay veterans of the United States Marine Corps by assaulting, detaining, and deporting their father who was simply trying to provide for his family? Last week, I joined several of my colleagues to tour the Adelanto ICE detention center. Thanks to the work of my colleague, Representative Judy Chu, our delegation was able to enter the facility to conduct an oversight visit and speak with some of those being detained. What I saw was people held in deplorable conditions, many of them being denied access to clean clothes for 10 days. Immigrant detention is a multimillion-dollar industry with some private prison groups now aiming to cash in on the funding included in the Republican spending bill. The GEO Group that owns Adelanto boasted about a $31 million windfall if they keep full capacity. Republicans want to boost the funding of ICE to hire more masked agents and pay out more contracts like that at Adelanto. According to my Republican colleagues, our budget is too tight to provide healthcare or groceries for those in need, it is too tight to keep hospitals in rural areas open, but it is flush with enough cash to pay for more masked agents and more inhumane detention facilities for those who are beaten and dragged off the street.  This is not who we are. This is not the character of our country. I don't think my Republican colleagues understand the gravity of their silence. It seems they have been silenced from speaking out against this brutality due to their fear of this President. They are even too afraid to hold townhalls to face their own constituents directly. It is sad that many Members of Congress have rolled over and enabled this cruelty that is now happening in our country. There are Members on this side of the aisle who have not been silent, who have actively opposed this President and will continue to speak out. Democrats will continue to be a check against this President. We will continue to fight for the due process rights of every American. We will continue to show up in our communities so that the American people can see that there are some Members of Congress who will actually listen to and fight for them."
"Mr. Chair, I think that the member is talking about the Canada-Quebec accord. Is that right?"
I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.
"I stood on a promise to stop sewage polluting our waterways in Bolton, and under this Labour Government I am delighted that we are turning that pledge into action. Last year alone, 295 days-worth of sewage was dumped into Bolton's waterways. That is nothing short of a disgrace. I welcome the decision to block bonuses for United Utilities bosses, whose shameful record has gone unchecked for far too long. When asked to fix the problem, they pleaded poverty while pocketing massive bonuses. As a fellow north-west MP, does my right hon. Friend agree that it is high time United Utilities was held to account and stopped profiting from environmental destruction?"
"Mr. Chair, again, I am committed to ensuring that the Official Languages Act is implemented and respected across all federal institutions."
"right now, ICE is showing up at courthouses across the country, waiting to arrest people after their official immigration hearings. Is this what we thought we would see in America? ICE officials lying in wait to grab people who are actually following the rules? In some cases, these people had just had their cases dismissed. They walk into court, following the rules, doing what they were told, following the legal pathways, and they are being taken into unmarked cars and fast-tracked for deportation. Let's be clear: This isn't about catching dangerous criminals. It was never about catching dangerous criminals. These are moms, dads, students, grandparents, workers, people who are trying to get through the legal process the right way, but ICE is turning our courthouses into traps. The very places that immigrants are supposed to go to follow a legal path to citizenship have now become traps to lure people in so that they can be arrested, detained, and disappeared. ICE tricked a Vermonter, Mohsen Mahdawi. He has been legally in our State for 10 years. He showed up for the final step in his citizenship process only to have masked men detain him after he exited the courthouse. He knew it was a risk to show up, but he decided it was worth the risk to maybe finally become an American. Imagine going to court, following the process, and then getting arrested the second you step outside. That is what is happening in America right now. Last month, in San Francisco, four asylum-seekers were taken by ICE after their hearings were over. In New York City, even a city official, Comptroller Brad Lander, was detained by ICE while trying to support an immigrant friend. If they are willing to rough up city officials, mayors, and even a sitting U.S. Senator, what does that mean for the rest of us? These tactics are to scare people. People are now afraid to go to court. How does that possibly make our country more safe? People are skipping hearings, risking automatic deportation, because they don't trust the system anymore. How is anyone supposed to follow the legal steps if even those are now a risk? Republicans claim over and over again in committees that this is only about illegal immigration. It is not. If that were the case, then they would be just as outraged as I am that people are being snatched outside of their court hearings. It is an attack on due process, plain and simple. It is an attack on the idea that we all deserve a fair shot in this country. It is also a clear tactic to instill fear in all of us so that we will be intimidated into submission and stop standing up for our neighbors. ICE agents without visible ID, without any official markings on them, and with masks are acting more like vigilantes than agents of our government.  {time}  1100  Mr. Speaker, how can we even trust that these are government officials? It is nothing more than kidnapping, and it needs to stop. There should be no more secret arrests and no more plainclothes agents waiting outside of courtrooms. This kind of thing does not happen in democracy. It doesn't. The only way to protect Americans from these abuses is to provide due process to anyone facing deportation. Due process exists to protect American citizens and to protect all of us from wrongful deportation and wrongful detention. This administration does not seem to care about this complete and total violation of our constitutional rights, a right that we are all entitled to, regardless of status. Under Trump, ICE and DHS have become a means to carry out political arrests and to silence anyone that disagrees with their extreme agenda. That is what we are looking at right now. It has never been about removing the criminals. It has always been about creating mass fear and mass intimidation so they can retain more power. This is not what Americans want. I need my Republican colleagues to fight for everyone in their district. I need them to speak up. Mr. Speaker, where is your line?"
"Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for her speech, which presented the truth and the facts known to all voters when it came time to vote. As we know, the Bloc Québécois has suffered a number of election losses at the hands of the Liberals, particularly in the riding of Laurier—Sainte‑Marie , where the member who spent his entire career standing up for the environment suddenly changed his mind on the carbon tax, yet was re-elected with a 17,000-vote majority in a left-leaning, proud and very environmentally conscious riding. How does the member explain that?"
"Mr. Speaker, Canada is a nation rich in resources, talent and opportunity. From potash to petroleum, from uranium to wheat, our country has what the world needs, yet our potential is being held back, not by people or the land but by federal policies that make it harder to build and grow. As we debate Bill C-5 , the so-called building Canada act, we must ask whether this legislation fixes what is broken or merely patches over the cracks. This bill acknowledges that Canada's regulatory system has become a barrier to progress, but instead of fixing the system for everyone, it offers a shortcut for a chosen few. In my riding of Souris—Moose Mountain, we do not just talk about resource development; we live it. Our oil fields, potash mines and farmers provide food, fuel and fertilizer to Canadians and our global partners. We understand that development must be responsible, but also possible. This bill claims it would fast-track national interest projects, but what qualifies as national interest remains undefined. Who decides, based on what and for how long? The answers are not in this legislation, and that is part of the problem. Clause 5 of the bill would allow cabinet to designate certain projects for special treatment, but the criteria are vague, the process is opaque and the project list is not even public. That raises serious questions about transparency, fairness and accountability. What is more, the so-called fast-track powers expire in five years. That is not a solution. That is an admission that the government does not believe in its own regulatory framework. If it did, it would not need exemptions, and that is what this bill is, an exemption. It is not a reform or a replacement, and it would not streamline the system for its investors. It picks winners. It does not restore confidence in Canada's regulatory framework; it dodges it. This is not how we build national prosperity. This is how we sow regional division, because when some projects leapfrog the process while others languish, people start to lose faith, not just in the system but in the fairness of our country. We have seen what happens when politics trumps policy. Major infrastructure projects are cancelled, pipelines are stalled and billions of dollars in investment are lost. That is not progress; that is paralysis. Bill C-5 would do nothing to prevent activist litigation or intergovernmental obstruction. There is no mechanism in the bill to protect approved projects from being blocked after the fact and no real incentive for provinces or regulators to speed up their approvals. What is the point of declaring a project in the national interest if we cannot ensure it gets built? Let us talk about timelines. The government says it wants projects approved within two years, but the bill would not in any way legislate a deadline. There is no guarantee and no enforcement. That means more uncertainty for project proponents. Let us contrast that with the United States, where certain federal energy projects are approved within 30 days. That is what it means to get serious about competitiveness. Here in Canada, we say we are in a crisis, but we act like we are not. The Minister of Natural Resources himself said there is no investment certainty in Canada, but who created that problem? The Liberals have been in power for nearly a decade. Bill C-69 , Bill C-48 and layers of overlapping regulation did not appear overnight. They were built piece by piece by the government. Now we are told to celebrate not a fix but a workaround. What Conservatives are calling for is simple: to make Canada competitive again. Let us repeal the broken laws, create shovel-ready zones, cap review times to one year, fast-track permitting through a single, reliable process and, yes, use section 92(10) of the Constitution to declare major projects like pipelines and transmission corridors to the general advantage of Canada. That is how we ensure that national interest is not held hostage to provincial politics or activist pressures. We also need to address labour mobility. We have thousands of foreign-trained doctors, nurses and engineers who could fill shortages all across the country but cannot work due to a patchwork of credentialing rules. A Conservative government would implement a blue seal standard, modelled after the Red Seal for trades, that would allow professionals to practise across Canada if they meet national standards. This bill could have included that. It did not. It is another missed opportunity. I would like to share a story of a couple I met in Estevan. They run a small oil field service company. They are honest, hard-working and deeply committed to their community. They told me their biggest challenge is not financing or labour; it is uncertainty. They never know when the new rules from Ottawa will change everything. They want to invest, expand and hire, but not if the ground keeps shifting beneath them. That uncertainty is echoed across this country. It is in mining, forestry, clean energy and even nuclear, where world-leading projects in Saskatchewan remain stuck in regulatory limbo. Bill C-5 offers no assurance that things will get better, only that some projects and some companies might get lucky. Dr. Jack Mintz warned that without regulatory certainty, capital will flow elsewhere, and that is exactly what we are seeing. Investors are not waiting for us to get our act together. They are putting their money where approvals are predictable, often south of the border, and while Canada stalls, the U.S. moves. While we hold consultations, they build. While we argue over definitions, they approve projects in weeks, not years. We are falling behind, not because of a lack of resources or workers, but because we lack a government willing to make the hard choices. Let me summarize our concerns. This bill leaves too much power in the hands of cabinet; lacks clear criteria for project selection; has no enforceable timelines; invites legal challenges; offers no protection against future political interference; sunsets in five years, offering no long-term certainty; and picks a few winners instead of fixing the system for all. Canadians deserve better. They deserve a regulatory system that is fast, fair and final. They deserve to know that when a project is approved, it will be built. They deserve leadership that does not just manage decline, but believes in building something greater. Conservatives will continue to support projects that grow our economy, strengthen our sovereignty and create opportunity for all Canadians. We will work with any party to pursue real reforms, not just symbolic gestures. We will always stand up for the people who power our nation, from Estevan to Arcola, from potash miners to oil field welders, because we believe in their future and we will fight for it. In Souris—Moose Mountain, we take great pride in being builders. Whether it is potash operations around Rocanville, oil wells of the Bakken formation or the grain and cattle operations that dot the landscape, we are a region that contributes to the economic backbone of this country. However, increasingly, people in my constituency are telling me they feel their efforts are being undercut by policy decisions made in Ottawa that fail to reflect the reality on the ground. They ask me this: Why does it take years to approve something that should be straightforward? Why are we losing investment to the United States and elsewhere when we have the resources and expertise to get things done here? Why does the government keep announcing grand frameworks that never seem to translate into shovels in the ground or jobs in our communities? Bill C-5 should have been the answer to those questions, but it is not. Instead, it is a narrowly tailored mechanism that selects a few special projects for acceleration without addressing the fundamental problems that hold the rest of the country back. It creates a two-tier system: one for the politically favoured and one for everyone else. What Canada needs is a one-tier system that works for all, for everyone in every region. We need a system that respects the regulatory rigour that our environment and indigenous people deserve, but one that does so in a way that is efficient, transparent and accountable. We need to stop creating special lanes and start fixing the entire road. Our caucus has put forward common-sense proposals that would accomplish exactly that: a one-year cap on project approvals, a six-month fast-track option for strategic projects, transparent national standards that recognize provincial authority, and the repeal of burdensome laws, like Bill C-69 and Bill C-48 , that have made it nearly impossible to build anything of consequence. In short, we want Canada to be a country where great ideas get built, where workers get hired and where prosperity is not an accident, but is the result of deliberate, focused policy choices that support growth rather than stifle it. It is not about ideology; it is about practicality. A strong resource sector helps pay for hospitals, schools, roads and the public services we rely on across the country. It supports jobs in urban and rural communities alike. When done right, it positions Canada as a responsible leader in global energy and environmental standards. Canadians do not just want a government that points at a few shiny projects and says, “Look what we did”; they want a government that builds a system that works reliably and consistently for all."
"As we have seen in so many areas, the previous Government may have made promises about this station, but they allocated no feasibility or development funding to get the project moving. Through the spending review and infrastructure strategy, this Government will provide at least PS445 million of rail enhancements over the next 10 years to deliver long-term infrastructure needs in Wales, including new stations. Details of how this funding will be allocated will be announced in due course."
"Successive Conservative Governments stripped our councils of funding for youth services, pitting them against services that were under statutory protections. That has led to one in eight councils no longer having a youth centre. Croydon, which is London's youngest borough, is about to lose its youth engagement team and its last crumb of council-run universal youth provision. Can the Deputy Prime Minister outline what this Labour Government are doing to support our young people? Does she agree that it is time to look again at statutory protections for youth services, so that all young people, no matter where they live, can get the services they deserve?"
I see that two Joshes remain.
"I welcome the announcements today. Finally, we have a Government who are willing to match rhetoric with action when it comes to investment in the north and the midlands. The Network North so-called plan, announced under the Tories, was pitched as an attempt to compensate northern communities for the loss of High Speed 2. My constituents were somewhat surprised that there was not a single mention of Cheshire in that so-called plan. What assurance can my right hon. Friend give that towns outside mayoral areas, as well as city regions, will see the benefits of crucial infrastructure investment?"
"My hon. Friend makes a really important point, and I was about to respond to a question that she raised in her very good contribution to this debate. We will set out the details of our approach to SEND reform in a schools White Paper, which we intend to publish in the autumn. We recognise that we need to support mainstream schools in providing much greater inclusion for children with SEND. We need to commence a phased transition process, which will include working with local authorities to manage their SEND system, including deficits. There will also be an extension to the dedicated schools grant statutory override until the end of 2027-28--an issue that many Members have raised on behalf of their local authorities. We will provide more details by the end of the year, including a plan for supporting local authorities with both historical and accruing deficits. I turn to teacher training. I was very sorry to hear about the experience of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Adam Dance). He is incredibly brave, and it is important that he has shared that. To respond to his question, high-quality teaching is central to ensuring that all pupils are given the best possible opportunities to achieve. To support all teachers, the Department is implementing a range of teacher training reforms that will ensure that teachers have the skills to help all pupils to succeed. We are determined to make sure that every family is a stable, loving home, and that no child grows up in poverty, lacks food or warmth or is denied success due to their background. We are determined to turn things around, tackle child poverty and spread growth and opportunity to every family in every corner of the country. The Labour Government have announced that we are extending free school meals to all children from households in receipt of universal credit from September 2026. That will lift 100,000 children across England out of poverty and put PS500 back in families' pockets. We are supporting parents through that decisive action, which will improve lives--and that is before the child poverty strategy comes out later this year. Providing over half a million children from disadvantaged backgrounds with a free, nutritious lunch time meal, every school day, will also lead to higher attainment, improved behaviour and better outcomes, which means that children will get the best possible education and chance to succeed in work and life. We will provide more detail in due course, but decisions such as expanding free school meals do not happen by accident, nor are they simply the outcome of hard work by campaigners outside this place. They are decisions about who we put first in our national life, and who has the first call on our country's resources. Our Government put children first. Expanding free school meal eligibility is a choice made by this Government, who are determined to secure a brighter tomorrow for our children and ensure excellence everywhere, for all our young people. This Government know that delivering the most equal society--something that we Government Members are determined to make real--is a choice, not something achieved by chance. On the points hon. Members raised about children's social care, we are putting children first. This Government are committed to delivering children's social care reform, to break the cycle of late intervention, and to help more children and families thrive and stay safely together. For 2025-26, the Department has allocated PS380 million to deliver children's social care reform, including PS44 million of new investment to support children in kinship and foster care, as announced at the autumn Budget. Because this Government are determined to ensure that all children have the best start in life, by 2028 we aim for 75% of children to reach a good level of development by the end of reception, which means that approximately 45,000 more children each year will start school ready to learn, thrive and succeed. That is ambitious. No progress has been made on this measure in many years. We are creating 6,000 nursery places in schools across the country through the first wave of 300 school-based nurseries; that is backed by PS37 million."
What progress his Department has made on developing an industrial strategy.
The hon. member for Winnipeg North has a point of order.
"The Government are investing significant amounts of money to train more construction workers. We appreciate fully the importance of independent training providers in training the workforce needed to deliver more homes across England. I suggest that my hon. Friend and I find time to meet Baroness Smith from the Department for Education to discuss matters relating to ITPs, including the CSV in my hon. Friend's constituency."
"I would like to start by paying tribute to Berney Hall, who is in the Gallery today and who has been campaigning for a change in the law to remove the 12-month limitation period for historic cases of rape of 13 to 15-year-old girls, when they occurred before 2004. It can take years for victims of abuse to come forward. Baroness Kennedy of Cradley tabled amendments to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill in the other place which sought to close this loophole, but they were not taken forward by the previous Government. That is why I have tabled new clause 160. I hope the Government will give all survivors of this terrible crime the closure and justice they deserve. I am supporting several amendments today, including new clause 9 tabled by the hon. Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion). I recently met a mum from my constituency whose ex-partner was convicted of sexual communication with a child and put on the sex offenders register, but was then allowed to change his name.  Understandably, my constituent was horrified to learn that he could take on a new identity, and that other women might not be aware. New clause 9 would stop offenders avoiding monitoring measures that are important for public safety, as well as reassuring victims that perpetrators cannot dodge the repercussions of their actions. I am also supporting new clauses 85 to 88, new clauses 121 and 122, and new clause 102. In addition, I support new clause 120, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Monica Harding), which would strengthen protections for emergency workers by addressing hate-motivated offences committed against them in private dwellings. No one doing their job to protect others should face abuse. Whether on the street or in someone's home, hate-fuelled attacks on those who serve the public must be prosecuted with the seriousness they warrant. Finally, I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Mike Martin) for tabling new clause 43, which would ensure the Government implement the Protection from Sex-based Harassment in Public Act 2023. No one should have to put up with sexual harassment and this change in the law is long overdue."
"Mr. Speaker, nobody is denying that there are times when there is a choice to drive an electric car or denying the people making that choice. There is nothing wrong with that. What is wrong is the government mandating that everybody drive an electric car instead of a gas-powered car rather than giving them the choice. The decision has to make economic sense. It has to make sense for the driver and the Canadian economy. That is what we are saying here today."
"We have transformed the relationship with the Welsh Government, and our two Labour Governments are delivering on the priorities of the people of Wales. Together we have delivered a record-breaking budget settlement for the Welsh Government; NHS waiting lists have fallen for four months in a row; tens of thousands of new jobs have been secured through inward investment; and pay rises are helping people across Wales, following the record increases to the national and living wage."
"I rise today to honor the life and legacy of a great Mississippian, A.E. ``Peter'' Pierce of Helena, who went home to be with the Lord in the early morning hours of May 24th. Peter was the very best of us--a devoted husband to his beloved Grace for nearly 69 years, a U.S. Army veteran, a hardworking father, grandfather, and public servant, and a man whose quiet faith was lived out in every act of service. From the shipyards of Pascagoula to the halls of the Jackson County Board of Supervisors, from coaching little league to mowing the church lawn even after his diagnosis--Peter gave his time, his energy, and his heart to others. He was a faithful member of Escatawpa Assembly of God, a friend to the forgotten, and the kind of man who cooked Christmas breakfast for a house full of grandkids, always reminding them: he was the most blessed man on earth. We grieve his loss, but we celebrate a life well-lived, and we thank God for the example he gave us."
"Yes. My hon. Friend has a long history of standing up to antisemitism, including when it stained and sullied our own party, and I am grateful to him for his leadership on this. Those questions about what happens at Glastonbury are not for the BBC. There are serious questions for the BBC about what it broadcast and the decisions that it took, but there are also wider questions about the sorts of things that we want to see in our country. As the Secretary of State, I have been very clear that it is not for the Government to try to determine what can be seen and what can be heard, but I also have a view about this as an individual: I do not want to see that sort of thing, I do not want to hear it, and I take great exception to it. The Prime Minister was very clear on that point as well. It causes harm to people in the real world, and I have felt that very strongly this weekend. That is why this Government are determined that, wherever we see that form of antisemitism--including the appalling comments that my hon. Friend referenced that were targeted towards an individual in the music industry simply because they were Jewish--we will always stand up to it and not hesitate to take action."
"as chairman of the RSC Rescissions Task Force, I am proud to support this bill to codify the DOGE cuts. The American people know waste, fraud, and abuse when they see it. They want us to eliminate Democrats' radical agenda, including $5.1 million for global LGBTQ movements, $3 million for circumcisions in Zambia, and $833,000 for transgender surgeries in Nepal. This package also ensures tax dollars aren't used to weaponize media against the American people. The CEO of NPR called President Trump a fascist while claiming her network is unbiased. These outlets can be as insane as they want--they might want to check CNN's ratings before doing that--but they are just not going to do it with American taxpayer dollars anymore. This rescissions package is only the first step, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Harrigan)."
"I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Morrison), the author of this resolution."
"Last week, 32 NATO nations came together at the summit in The Hague, united in collective deterrence and in our collective defence of the Euro-Atlantic area. I can report to the House that NATO is now bigger, stronger and more lethal than before. We signed a new defence investment pledge of 5% of GDP by 2035, with new capability commitments from each nation. It was a good day for NATO, a good day for British jobs, and a bad day for Putin. Everyone at the summit agreed that Iran should never have nuclear weapons. We all want the ceasefire between Israel and Iran to hold, and we will work to support it. Finally, we also discussed it creating a new opportunity for a ceasefire in Gaza, which would be a vital step on the path to peace."
"One in 10 women in Northern Ireland is thought to have endometriosis, and the average wait time for diagnosis is an unacceptable nine and a half years. Does the Minister agree that there needs to be a UK-wide strategy  that equips our NHS with endo-experienced surgeons, fertility experts, mental health support and pain specialists in order to aid those women, who are on the most horrifically painful journey?"
"I share my hon. Friend's anger. He is a powerful advocate for his constituents, who have endured disruption, and I agree entirely that the way this project was handled was a dereliction of duty on the part of the previous Government. That is why we have appointed new leadership, why we are accepting all the recommendations of the James Stewart review, and why we are going through this fundamental reset. As soon as I have received advice from the new chief executive about the revised cost and schedule, I will update my hon. Friend and other hon. Members."
"today, I introduce a bill that would make a small but respectful change to federal law by adding the Mayor of the District of Columbia to the list of named principals for whom the President shall order the U.S. flag be flown at half-staff. Current law states that the President shall make this order ``upon the death of principal figures of the United States Government and the Governor of a State, territory, or possession, as a mark of respect to their memory.'' Surely the D.C. Mayor, who has the same responsibilities as governors of states and territories, should qualify as such a principal. This bill is part of our series of bills to ensure equal treatment for the over 700,000 D.C. residents. In the 116th Congress, the House Committee on the Judiciary passed this bill. Congress has already acknowledged that D.C. is entitled to a place among the states for certain honors. For example, legislation we got enacted gave D.C. a coin after D.C. was omitted from legislation creating coins for the states and required the armed services to display the D.C. flag whenever the flags of the states are displayed. We got D.C.'s Frederick Douglass and Pierre L'Enfant statues placed in the Capitol, alongside two statues from each state. We also successfully worked with the U.S. Postal Service to create a D.C. stamp, like the stamps for the states, and with the National Park Service to add the D.C. flag alongside the state flags near Union Station. I urge my colleagues to support this bill."
"May I start by associating myself with the sympathies given over the news coming from India this morning, which will be causing great anxiety to many of my constituents? The Ascension Eagles cheerleading team of Silvertown have just returned triumphant from an important event in Florida. As a sports fan, Mr Speaker, you will know that almost 100,000 people take part in cheerleading now. It has recently been recognised by Sport England, but it often goes unrecognised by the wider public. Does the Leader of the House agree that we need to do more to shine a light on grassroots sports that often do not get recognition? Will she start today by congratulating the Ascension Eagles on their success in showing the Americans what talent the girls and boys of east London have?"
"I come to the floor to join my colleagues to express outrage over the actions taking place in Los Angeles when our dear colleague Alex Padilla, Senator Padilla, was thrown out of an event where he was just simply trying to express his opinion on behalf of the millions of Californians that he represents. It is so interesting to me that this situation happened because not that long ago in the State of Washington, in Olympia, we had a bill signing, and it is no secret in the State of Washington that a guy named Tim Eyman is probably the antithesis of what our Governor Bob Ferguson believes. He fights him on all sorts of initiatives to the people about policies that Mr. Eyman wants to express. So he is a noted individual in our State. So Mr. Eyman shows up at a press conference to basically protest a bill that the Governor is going to sign. And he gets into the Governor's office, and he stands right behind our Governor. One of our legislators, who basically wants the Governor to know that this individual, who he disagrees with--doesn't support this bill--has now snuck into the Governor's press conference. So what does our Governor do? He turns around, and he looks at Mr. Eyman, and he says, ``Oh, why are you here?'' And he said, ``I'm here to protest this.'' And the Governor turns around and delivers his remarks. Because, you know why? Because our Governor was not afraid what Tim Eyman said. Our Governor didn't think, You throw him out of the building, and he is just a constituent. It is not like he is a State rep. It is not like he got elected by people. Our Governor was not afraid to let this voice be heard. But somehow, ICE and Homeland Security are afraid of the voice of Alex Padilla. They are afraid of Alex Padilla's presence in a room. Now, how can that be in the United States of America that a Senator elected by the people of his State, who simply wants to go to a public meeting and have his voice heard on behalf of his constituents, is handcuffed and thrown to the ground? It is not acceptable. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle need to say, ``This is not acceptable.'' Are we trying to freeze the voice of dissent? Are we trying to say that we cannot understand what true public policy discourse is about? I think weshowed in Olympia, WA, that we are big enough to take it, that we know that if somebody disagrees with us, we are not going to get them thrown out. And in this case, to have a U.S. Senator handcuffed and thrown to the ground is disrespectful. It is an atrocity. We need to understand how this is happening and if this administration or this side of the aisle thinks that is the way you treat the voice of a U.S. Senator expressing dissent. I yield the floor."
"Mr. Chair, these two numbers are public. The minister must know what they are."
"I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for the opportunity to clarify that the British Government are not providing information to enable the bombing campaign in Gaza. The decisions that we took in relation to arms suspension bind the whole Government--they are not just the decisions of the Foreign Office--and represent a sober, reasoned, serious analysis of the risks of breaches of international humanitarian law, and they bind the Government in our approach. I will take brief issue with the right hon. Gentleman's characterisation of my remarks, because I have been clear on the F-35 point. We continue to be clear on that point. Indeed, we have explained it at length in court."
I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.
"I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Everett L. Dargan, an outstanding surgeon, a devoted husband and father, and an all-around good citizen of South Carolina. Dr. Dargan passed away on April 1, 2025, and leaves an enduring legacy of stewardship, excellence, and distinction. He led an inspiring life of remarkable achievement and grace as a scholar, surgeon, sportsman, public servant, mentor, and friend to many. Growing up in Columbia, South Carolina during the Great Depression, Dr. Dargan supported his family by shining shoes, delivering newspapers, waiting tables, and working summers on his uncles' family farm. At the age of 15, Dr. Dargan won a scholarship to Morehouse College in Atlanta. He later transferred to the University of Buffalo in upstate New York, where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology in 1949. Dr. Dargan continued his education at Howard University's College of Medicine where he earned his M.D. and won First Prize in Medicine. After medical school, he completed his internship at Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn, New York, and was later named chief resident surgeon at the Bronx Municipal Hospital Center of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Dr. Dargan interrupted his specialty training to serve in the United States Air Force as a captain and commander of the 3910th USAF Hospital in Mildenhall/Lakenheath, England, during the Korean War. Later, he would continue his commitment to providing quality medical care to military veterans through his service to the Dorn Veterans Administration Medical Center in Columbia, South Carolina. Dr. Dargan returned to New York and continued his commitment to academic medicine as a researcher and instructor through various appointments, including associate professor of surgery at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, chief of surgery at Lincoln Hospital, and director of surgery at Sydenham Hospital. At Lincoln Hospital, he met his wife, a registered nurse and flight attendant at TWA, Carol Poyner. They married in 1965, and later moved to Boston, where Dr. Dargan completed his training in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at Boston City Hospital, achieving the post of chief resident surgeon, and became a thoracic surgical instructor at Boston University Medical Center in Massachusetts. In keeping with his commitment to academic surgery as teacher, practitioner and researcher, he taught medical students and surgical residents for more than 12 years. Dr. Dargan was an advocate for indigent patient care and quality medical care for veterans. In 1978, Dr. Dargan returned to Columbia for the remainder of his career, first joining the private medical practice of Cyril Spann, M.D., and then joining in partnership with Gerald A Wilson, M.D., to form Midlands Surgical Associates, PA, a private surgical practice. He remained dedicated to serving his fellow veterans with excellent medical care, practicing at Dorn Veterans Medical Center for decades. Dr. Dargan was the first African American surgeon to serve as chief of surgery and then chief of staff at Richland Memorial Hospital (now Prisma Health). A lifelong scholar, he was honored by the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society in 1996 for his distinguished career of leadership in medicine. After retirement from his surgical practice in 2004, Dr. Dargan worked for the South Carolina Board of Medical Examiners for nearly a decade. In 2020, Dr. Dargan received the Dean's Distinguished Service Award as a Friend of the University of South Carolina School of Medicine. In a final act of service, Dr. Dargan donated his body to the Department of Anatomy at Howard University College of Medicine, to aid in the training of future medical professionals. Throughout his career, he trained fellow surgeons, presenting research findings, and delivering papers at medical conferences in Africa and throughout the United States, often at meetings of the American College of Surgeons, where he became a Fellow, and for the National Medical Association. He was a lifelong devoted member of Zion Baptist Church, where he served as a trustee. Dr. Dargan was renowned for his knowledgeable, professional, and kind relationships with his patients. He was a practitioner who offered his patients holistic and nutritional advice, a lot of which he learned from his parents, both of whom grew up on rural farms, and particularly from his dietician mother. The Dargans have two daughters, Jennifer Dargan and Catherine Dargan Phelps; a son-in-law, Peter Phelps; and three grandchildren: Addison Dargan Phelps, Morgan Dargan Phelps, and Landon Dargan Phelps. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in celebrating the life and legacy of an incredible man and servant. Let us recognize Dr. Dargan's commitment to service, sacrifices for, and contribution to this great Nation."
"I am grateful to the right hon. Member for giving notice of his point of order. As he knows, it is not a matter for the Chair, but he has put his point on the record."
"Investment in renewables is an energy policy, but it is also an economic and employment policy. I can assure the hon. Member that investment from both the public sector and the private sector will see many good new jobs created in new sources of energy over the coming years and decades."
This has gone on too long. I would ask the member to be brief.
"After years of underfunding, the Government agreed a record uplift of PS3.1 billion for '25-26 for the pharmacy sector. The pharmacy access scheme provides PS19 million to support pharmacies in areas with fewer pharmacies, including in rural areas, but funding must always come with reform. Our hub and spoke legislation, if it is passed in the other place today, will allow pharmacies to streamline their dispensing processes, and it is a major step in the right direction in marrying reform with investment."
"The Iranian regime has long been a threat to peace, democracy and human rights, and the unilateral, illegal and dangerously provocative Israeli and, now, American attacks have made a tense situation extremely perilous and are completely outside international law. It is therefore deeply concerning to hear the Foreign Secretary echo the talking points of Netanyahu and Trump instead of standing up for those principles, clearly condemning the illegality of these bombings, and unequivocally ruling out the UK's being dragged into any military action to support such illegal action. Why will he not do so?"
"I can guarantee the hon. Lady that our industrial strategy will have a longer shelf life than hers did; I think it lasted 18 months--I am not entirely sure. We forget, because it did not have much of an impact. We have worked with all industries across the country to put together a comprehensive package that will make it easier to do business in the UK, and support our city regions and clusters across the country, where we have excellent industry. It will turbocharge the eight growth sectors, and it will make the Government more agile in interacting with business. That is why we are reforming the Office for Investment, as we have always said we will. It is now a significantly more substantial organisation, and will give significantly more support. The hon. Lady should look at--"
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 257, the Special Interest Alien Reporting Act of 2025. This legislation is a critical step toward enhancing transparency and ensuring the Department of Homeland Security provides accurate and timely reporting to the American people regarding encounters with special interest aliens attempting to illegally enter the United States. As chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, I fully support this effort to strengthen oversight and accountability within DHS and safeguard our national security. Under the Biden-Harris administration's dangerous open-borders policies, droves of special interest aliens, nearly 2 million, and many of them leveraging illicit smuggling networks and irregular migration patterns, flocked to our borders and exploited catch and release policies to access the interior of our country. The American people deserve to know not just how many entered our country and when, but where they came from. Fundamentally, this bill simply requires DHS to publicly report on how many special interest aliens were encountered, their countries of origin, and their last country of residence before trying to enter the United States illegally. The genius of this bill is that DHS can simply add it to the statistics it already reports on a monthly basis. Thisavoids any burdensome or duplicative reporting requirements for the department. Also, by simply reporting the number and nationality of SIA encounters at our borders, it has no impact on the integrity of ongoing anti-terrorism investigations and efforts of Federal law enforcement. Moreover, access to accurate information is critical for Congress to effectively conduct proper oversight, promote national security measures, and protect our American communities from the threats that special interest aliens pose. I simply cannot overstate the importance of passing this legislation, especially given the recent activity in the Middle East. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill, and I am grateful to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Greene) for bringing forth this important piece of legislation and for the support of the following cosponsors: Mr. Higgins, Mr. Guest, Mr. Pfluger, Mr. Crane, and Mr. Brecheen. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"I thank the gentleman for his strong statement. It is really an honor to serve with him on the Foreign Affairs Committee. We have many battles there as some try to push international funding for abortion. We have a couple more speakers who will be joining us. One will be the presiding chair, who is making her way down to the podium. I thank her for her leadership, as well."
I thank the hon. Member for his intervention and I completely agree with him. These are the sorts of safeguards that even the promoter of the Bill is saying should be there. I do not think that they are in the Bill and my amendment to new clause 15 would make them much stronger.
"Mr. Chair, I am not sure what that has to do with the main estimates."
"Mr. Chair, let me take a moment to congratulate my colleague for being here. It will be in October."
"Mr. Speaker, I have read Bill C-2 . I am going to address gun crime again. Let us get to the facts here. The guns are here and crimes are being committed. People are getting shot. There were records set in my city. I do not read anything in this bill that would curb that. Will the Liberals repeal Bill C-5 and Bill C-75 ? Catching criminals was never the problem; it is keeping them in jail."
"Mr. Speaker, our thoughts and prayers are with the family of former MP Marc Garneau. In order to make Canada a more self-reliant country that is less dependent on the United States and that stands up for its interests, does the member support the building of a pipeline in Canada?"
"I am sorry, but I am concluding. We are each speaking from our own experience and from the heart."
"I certainly have oomph, yes, and I am working as fast as I can on this. I will not talk now about the wider support that we are offering people in our former coalfield communities, but a whole raft of Government interventions are there to support people."
"I thank the Defence Secretary for advance sight of his statement, although I am more than disappointed that I only received the SDR two hours ago at 3.30 pm, after the journalists. The Defence Secretary and the Prime Minister are absolutely right. We have entered a new era--one defined by international instability, geopolitical conflict and global uncertainty. Perhaps not since the end of the cold war have we faced such myriad threats to our defence: a barbaric Russian imperialism under Putin threatening Ukraine's freedom and NATO's security; a Trumpian White House defined by its total indifference to, and even antagonism towards, the defence of Europe; and the rising threat posed by China, as well as by regional pariah states such as Iran and North Korea. Taken together, these threats pose a once-in-a-generation risk to our country's defence. Meeting generational risks will require making generational commitments, so I welcome the Government's readiness to accept all the recommendations outlined in today's strategic defence review. It is frankly staggering, however, that we still do not have a clear answer to the vital question: where is the money coming from to fund these ambitions? This is a shopping list without the money to pay for it. The Government have flip-flopped on whether we can expect  defence spending to rise to 3% of GDP--the figure on which the proposals of the SDR are premised. Putting the cart before the horse when it comes to funding the nation's defence sends entirely the wrong message to Putin and our other adversaries. Will the Secretary of State commit to holding cross-party talks on how to reach 3%? While I welcome the announcement of new funding for military housing and urgent repairs, fixing our recruitment crisis and doing right by our service personnel requires more than sticking-plasters. Will the Government legislate to require all military homes to be brought under the decent homes standard? It is desperately disappointing that despite having had 11 months to consider how to stem the decline in the number of soldiers in the Army, the Government appear to have sat on their hands. The shameful decline in troop numbers has only continued on their watch. Does the Secretary of State agree that if the Government are serious about delivering for Britain's defence, reversing the utterly reckless troop cuts overseen by the Conservatives must begin now?"
"May I celebrate my wonderful hon. Friend for his role in founding Basildon Pride? Will he join me in commending York Pride and its 17,000 visitors for celebrating the wonderful LGBTQ+ community that we have in York? Will he also join me in condemning any abuse, harassment or intimidation--at any Pride event--that is driven by who someone is, who they love or what they believe?"
"Of course, Mr. Speaker, we support oil and the development of all energy options across this great country, but we also support the indigenous community because we realize, as a country, we must engage the indigenous community. Even for them, this is a journey of economic and social justice. The benefits of anything we do, oil, gas or development, that engages indigenous people will be long-lasting. We must reach all the people of our great country, including the indigenous community, in every corner of our country."
"I congratulate the acting chair of the Health and Social Care Committee, the hon. Member for Birmingham Erdington (Paulette Hamilton), on securing this important debate. It is almost one year since the Labour Government took office. They came to power promising that they had a plan to improve our NHS. However, what they actually had was a plan to get a plan by launching a consultation asking professionals and the public for ideas. The consultation was launched in October last year, and I understand that more than 220,000 people have contributed, but despite it being promised for spring, there is still no sign of it. Will the Minister commit to publishing a plan before the summer recess? While the Secretary of State considers what the plan should say, over in No. 11 we have seen the Chancellor follow the usual Labour playbook: higher spending, higher borrowing and higher taxes. There will be more funding for the NHS, yet as the chief executive of NHS England noted, the NHS budget is now equivalent to the entire GDP of Portugal, reaching PS226 billion in 2028-29. That is around 50% of public spending. It is said that 18th-century Prussia was an army with a state attached to it; 21st-century Britain is at risk of becoming a health service with a country attached to it. This is not the Government's money; it is taxpayers' hard-earned cash, yet the Government have provided no clarity--no meaningful detail and no credible plan--on how such vast sums will be used. In the autumn Budget, an additional PS10.6 billion in extra funding was promised for 2025-26. However, Julian Kelly, NHS England's former chief financial officer, told the Health and Social Care Committee that most of it will be consumed by pay settlements, the national insurance hikes and non-pay inflation. Today, 64% of NHS spending goes towards personnel wages and pensions, which is a far higher proportion than in other comparable systems, but the NHS still faces staff shortages and expensive agency costs. Will the Minister confirm how much of the overall funding will go to salary increases? How much will be diverted into covering  the national insurance increases for hospitals, social care, pharmacies, GPS, NHS contractors and social care providers? As we speak in this Chamber, resident doctors and nurses are balloting for industrial action. Strikes would only add to the disruption and delay in care for sick and vulnerable people. Do the Government have a plan to minimise the impact of strikes, should they occur? Let us look at one proposal that the Government have announced: the scrapping of NHS England. This Government by press release announced NHSE abolition without adequate planning. Ministers have dodged basic questions about costs, staffing changes and structural reform. There is, once again, no plan. The details that we know about do not inspire confidence. NHS England has asked the ICBs to reduce their costs by up to 50% by October 2025. ICBs will have to cluster, with the number expected to fall from 42 to 27 in two years. Many have warned that services will be cut, and redundancy payments linked to those restructurings could reach PS1 billion in 2025-26. Has the Minister costed that in the Department of Health and Social Care revenue settlement? The Government promised to restore the 18-week hospital waiting time within this Parliament. However, their departmental modelling shows that only 80% of patients may meet that standard for routine operations. Will the Minister confirm that the Government will deliver that promise? Moving on to capital spending, the Minister says that she wants to continue the new hospitals programme, albeit more slowly than we would have done, and invest in technology, but capital budgets remain flat in real terms. The chief executive of the NHS Confederation says that this leaves ""a major shortfall in capital funding"". The Nuffield Trust said that ""it will be difficult for the NHS to invest in the technology and facility upgrades it needs to meet the government's...targets."" Will the Minister explain how they will prioritise, and what will be delivered? The Government have said that they want to shift funding from hospitals to primary and community care. Will the Minister confirm or deny reports that the NHS 10-year plan will delay the planned increase in spending on primary community care until 2035, instead of 2029, as was originally promised? A key part of community care is social care, but as Daniel Elkeles, the chief executive of NHS Providers, noted, ""social care...hasn't been given the focus it needs"", and that is ""a significant blocker on progress for the NHS."" Cross-party talks on reform have quietly been abandoned in favour of an independent commission led by Baroness Casey, but that process is not due to complete until 2028. Yet again, we see headline-grabbing announcements from the Government, with no delivery plan and no real reform, leaving patients, staff and families waiting for the care they desperately need. The Government aim to deliver PS13.8 billion in efficiency savings by '28-29, with more than PS9 billion of that total expected to come from DHSC alone. Will the Minister clarify where, within the Department, those savings will be found, and what impact assessments have supported those decisions? The Government say that prevention is better than cure, and I agree. A good example is the ""Act FAST: face, arms, speech, time"" campaign, which we will all be familiar with, but just last week, in an answer to a written parliamentary question, the Minister admitted that ""the Government have made reductions in the Department and NHS England's communications and campaigns."" Can the Minister tell us which public health campaigns are to be affected? Finally, the dental contract requires reform. The Government started negotiations a year ago, yet the Public Accounts Committee has noted: ""NHSE and DHSC do not yet know what reform might look like or to what timescales it can be delivered"". Will the Minister tell us when the Government expect to conclude negotiations and get on with dental reform? In summary, the Government need to stop governing by headline. They need to publish a robust evidence-based plan, and start delivering."
The hon. parliamentary secretary.
"I am sorry, but I cannot take any interventions. New clause 20 is primarily about whether we think that abortion is a human right, and how we apply that principle to our laws here. It is also about the very present and real threat to access in our communities. Members will have seen outside this place the modern anti-abortion movement that we now have in the UK, and will have received the scaremongering emails. Of course those in that movement are reacting more strongly than ever to the idea of women having this human right protected in law, because their opposition is not about children. If it was, they would not shout at mine when they see them in the street. It is about controlling women. They do not openly advocate for an end to abortion access, but they make lurid claims, including the claim that there would be abortion at birth, so let me put that one to bed. Because new clause 20 retains  the 1967 framework, it retains not just the time limit--crucially, it is different from new clause 1 in that regard--but all the provisions in the 1967 Act relating to everyone involved in an abortion. We know that the majority of abortions happen at less than 10 weeks in this country, but we should protect the time limit. We should also protect the medics involved, because the person who gets a fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis after 20 weeks is the person we should protect most of all. If we reduce that time limit, and if we start to target medics--it could happen in this country, as in America--those people who are asked to carry to term a baby who they know will die will not get our protection. Yes, we must stop the investigations and prosecutions under outdated laws that make no sense, but we must also protect people at that most heartbreaking moment when they are told that a baby that they really want will not live. That is what keeping the 1967 Act does."
"Before I recognize the hon. parliamentary secretary, I would like to have members' attention. As colleagues are entering the chamber before question period, there is a lot of noise. If we could, let us continue with debate. The hon. parliamentary secretary."
"Mr. Chair, at the first nations meeting 10 days ago, there was consensus to advance projects of national interest. Our government will work with the premiers, indigenous peoples and the private sector to get projects—"
"had I been present, I would have voted NAY on Roll Call No. 156."
"I agree with my hon. Friend. We have data, but we remain unsure where the lowest uptake is. I would like to go to the wards in my area where uptake is low and knock on doors to encourage women to go to their screenings, so it would helpful to have precise data from the two hospitals in the Doncaster and Bassetlaw hospitals trust. Several organisations across Bassetlaw support people with cancer, and I wish to highlight the work of Aurora in Worksop, which offers support to people during and after cancer treatment. From exercise spaces to beauty treatments, emotional support or even just a cup of tea with a friendly face and a listening ear, organisations like Aurora in our constituencies are the unsung heroes for people going through the challenge that is cancer treatment."
"My hon. Friend mentioned the issues caused for businesses. There are also significant issues for charities. In my constituency, many local charities and community groups receive cash donations and struggle to find a place to bank them. Does he agree that this is an issue for charities, just as much as it is for local businesses?"
"This matter has been raised with me before, and it is concerning. We want people to enjoy the countryside and, specifically, the great countryside in her constituency. It is great that people on social media are advertising it, but if they are not also telling people what steps they need to take to keep themselves safe on our mountains, then that is a challenge. I will certainly raise that point with Ministers for my hon. Friend."
"It is a pleasure to respond to today's estimates debate on defence expenditure. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for North Cotswolds (Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown), the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee, for securing the debate with the Backbench Business Committee, and particularly for timing it perfectly for the NATO summit and Armed Forces Week. Given the threats we face from Russia and the instability in the middle east and elsewhere, it is welcome in principle that NATO states have agreed at this week's summit to increase spending. Nevertheless, when we consider what the Government's announcement means for UK defence expenditure, we must be clear that talk of 5% on national security and 3.5% on defence is nothing but a con. It is unadulterated smoke and mirrors when we need real investment at real pace to produce a real step change in our deterrence. Consider first the promise of 5% on national security by 2035, consisting of 3.5% on the core defence budget and 1.5% on resilience and security. The Prime Minister confirmed on GB News yesterday that the 1.5% is already being spent. Not a penny of new money is being spent on actual military capability. As for the core defence budget, Labour has promised 3.5% in 10 years' time, but the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster confirmed on yesterday's media round that there is no plan to fund that increase, and there will not be one until at least 2029. If there is no plan for 3.5% in the Parliament after next, what about a plan for 3% in the next Parliament? The authors of the strategic defence review wrote on the day of its publication, 2 June, that the decision to go to 3% ""established the affordability of our recommendations across a 10-year programme."" The problem is this: the Government no more have a plan to fund 3.5% in a decade than to fund 3% in the years leading up to it. It means that the promises of the SDR were dead on arrival, and the headline pledge of ""up to 12"" nuclear submarines is a fantasy fleet based on fantasy funding. Most worryingly, the smoke and mirrors are not just being used for spending in future Parliaments. What I am about to say is subject to the caveat that in response to our written questions to the Treasury, it is simply not sharing with us the quantum of money that has been moved from the intelligence budget into defence. Nevertheless, as far as we can see, Labour is not going to spend the 2.5% that it promised for defence by 2027. To recap, in his defence spending statement in February, the Prime Minister confirmed that intelligence spending would be added to the core defence budget, taking it to 2.6%. By our reckoning, that intelligence spend is the equivalent of almost 0.2% of GDP. Subtracting that from 2.6% gives a figure of just over 2.4%. The smoke and mirrors do not end there. That 2.4% will have to cover the cost of Chagos, which is at least PS250 million next year, rising to a total of PS30 billion. That 2.4% will also have to include spending on election interference, and other non-official development assistance FCDO expenditure that the spending review confirmed would now be added to the defence budget. The significance of that is that if 2.6% is actually in the region of 2.4%, it will mean that the increase in defence spending to 2027 is not the biggest since the cold war, because it will be less than the increase when Boris Johnson was Prime Minister in 2019. Here is the upshot of the so-called 5% on national security that Labour has announced at NATO: no new money in the 1.5% for security and resilience, just reclassification of existing spending; no plan to get to 3.5% on the core defence budget by 2035; and no plan to get to 3% on the core defence budget in the next Parliament. The detail of the spending review confirmed that when spending hits the supposed figure of 2.6% in 2027, it does not increase towards 3% but stays flat. Worse than that, as I have explained, defence spending does not get to 2.6% on defence at all, but to something like 2.4% at best. It is smoke and mirrors at every turn. If there is one thing worse than the lack of substance in Labour's defence spending spin, it is the lack of urgency. Its promises are all about 2035, a decade away, but the threats that we face are real and imminent. As the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee said in his excellent speech, last July the head of the Army, General Walker, said that we must be ready for a war not in a decade or even five years, but within three years. The SDR promised a bigger Army in reserve, but only in the 2030s. Its big headline promise on attack submarines will be delivered into the 2040s. Warfare is changing fast, but Labour is moving far too slowly. The SDR was promised for the spring, but published in the summer. The defence industrial strategy was also promised for the spring, but the Minister recently confirmed to me in a written answer that it is months away. The Government must move much faster to boost the total lethality of our forces in the near term, not least by rapidly embracing the extraordinary opportunity to boost our overall mass and capability through autonomous systems and drones. In my defence drone strategy, the aim was to provide high-quality drone and anti-drone tech for Ukraine--which we have done, and I am very proud of that--and then to learn from that, in parallel, to build a UK sovereign drone industrial base, but that has been completely stymied by the procurement freeze effectively in place since the election. Labour is prioritising penny-pinching over rapid rearmament. While Ukraine is producing thousands and thousands of drones every month, Labour ordered just three new military drones for the British armed forces in its first financial year in government. What would we do differently? We would go to 3% on defence in this Parliament. We would scrap the Government's crazy Chagos deal and use the money to rapidly rearm, starting with next year's PS250 million on Chagos. That cash could be spent not on tax cuts for the Mauritians, but on drones and anti-drone tech from British SMEs--on tech that is battle-proven in Ukraine and can be produced in months, and that can be ordered at a low cost but a sufficient scale to enable the Army to start training comprehensively in drone warfare by next year. That is the kind of urgency that we need to see against the threat we face. If the country hears that the Government are going to spend 5% of GDP on defence, it will assume that it will be like in 1985, when we actually spent 5% of GDP on our military, not on smoke and mirrors. That gave us 337,000 regular personnel, over 600 combat aircraft and a full array of tactical nuclear weapons for land, sea and air. Perhaps there is a reason why our 5% then was so different from Labour's 5% today: in 1985, our Prime Minister actually led the country. Instead of surrendering sovereignty, Mrs Thatcher stood up to Galtieri and successfully defended the Falklands. She would never have been neutral when asked if she supported strikes by the US on the nuclear programme of a country like Iran. By standing shoulder to shoulder with Washington, she helped to bring down the Berlin wall and relight the torch of freedom in Europe. Far from returning to the days of 1985 and actually spending 5% of GDP on defence, we now have instead a massive con trick from Labour. Unfunded ambitions and smoke and mirrors will not deter our adversaries. In Armed Forces Week, those who bravely serve our nation deserve much better."
"Order. Before we proceed, I think I am right in saying that every Member present who is likely to want to intervene has done so; well done. I would not wish hon. Members to believe that ordinarily they are likely to get away with the length of interventions that they have got away with tonight. I understand that this is an important issue, and that there are constituency matters that need to be raised and placed on the record, but do not take the lenience of the Chair for granted. Members should bear in mind, as one hon. Lady has not, that if they intervene, they are expected to stay till the end of the debate to hear the Minister's response."
"Again, this is not a point of order. This is a matter of debate. I also believe that the Speaker has already indicated that the seat for Battle River—Crowfoot was vacated. The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade."
"I thank the Minister for all the work he is doing and the endless number of statements he has had to make on these horrific issues. I absolutely agree with him and support him in calling for both Israel and Hamas to make sure that all humanitarian aid is available and gets to innocent Palestinians, who desperately need it. The best way that we can solve this problem is through a ceasefire. Will he join me in expressing regret that after Israel accepted the Witkoff framework proposals for a ceasefire, Hamas decided to turn them down? We must put as much pressure as possible on Hamas to move forward with the ceasefire as soon as possible."
"I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m. on Tuesday, June 10, that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to executive session and resume consideration of Executive Calendar No. 49, postcloture; further, notwithstanding rule XXII at 11:15 a.m., the Senate vote on confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 49, and if cloture is then invoked on Calendar No. 112, Steven Vaden, the Senate recess following the cloture vote until 2:15 to allow for the weekly conference meetings; further, if cloture is invoked on the Vaden nomination, the postcloture time be expired at 2:15 p.m. and the Senate vote on confirmation of the Vaden nomination, and if any nominations are confirmed on Tuesday's session of the Senate, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; finally, that the filing deadline for all first-degree amendments to Calendar No. 66, S. 1582, and the substitute amendment No. 2307 be 2:30 p.m. tomorrow."
"Many of my elderly constituents had an unnecessarily cold and miserable winter, and the uncertainty to which the Minister constantly refers was of his Government's own making. Will he take this opportunity to apologise to my constituents?"
"Mr. Speaker, it is alway somebody else's fault. Jacob Funk has been arrested 37 times, and 37 times he has been released, over nine times in the past month. On April 27, it was assault with a weapon and uttering threats. On May 27, it was break and enter and disguising face. On June 8, it was assaulting a peace officer, resisting arrest and breach of release. On June 12, it was assault and uttering death threats. He is wreaking havoc on the citizens of Williams Lake, and the Prime Minister is letting him. When will he repeal his soft-on-crime policies and finally put victims' rights ahead of those of criminals?"
I thank the hon. Member for raising that case. I am pleased that the review is taking place. Victims of child sexual abuse are victims of some of the most heinous crimes in our society. That is why it is important that we get on with addressing the recommendations of the Alexis Jay review. We are putting measures in our Crime and Policing Bill and strengthening the Victims and Courts Bill to ensure that victims of such crimes are put at the heart of the criminal justice system and that the perpetrators feel the full force of the law.
"The Mellor bus factory in Rochdale was the perfect place for the Chancellor to unveil this PS15 billion investment in transport infrastructure today, and also to give a first taste of the changes to the Green Book and the Treasury rules, which for too long have held back places in the north and the midlands from getting their fair share of transport money. Does the Minister agree that investment in public transport is investment in local manufacturers like Mellor? Does this not show what a difference a Labour MP working with a Labour mayor and a Labour Government can make, to deliver the change that people voted for last year?"
"It is my duty to lay upon the table, pursuant to subsection 38(3.3) of the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act, the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner report for the fiscal year ended March 31. Pursuant to Standing Order 32(5), this report is deemed to have been permanently referred to the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates."
"I agree with my hon. Friend. It is a shame that the Conservative party has seemingly changed its view. [Interruption.] The shadow Secretary of State said, ""Yes, that's right. We've changed our view. It was a bad piece of legislation."" Many provisions in the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023 were some of the best introduced by the previous Government. There is lots in the previous Government's record that Conservative Members should rightly feel embarrassed about; these powers are not among that. Far from removing that power, we want acquiring authorities to use the power. For that reason, we cannot possibly accept the hon. Member's amendment."
"Mr. Chair, the cost of homes, in terms of housing infrastructure and the infrastructure required to build homes on, varies around the GTA. It varies with the building typology. It varies with the—"
"I thank the hon. Gentleman for his questions. The two-state solution conference next week is an important moment. We are discussing with our friends and allies our approach to that conference, and no doubt I will return to this House next week--with your permission, Mr Speaker--to discuss that further. I will not speculate on further sanctions from the Dispatch Box. We have taken these steps because of the extremist rhetoric and the damage that these two men have done to Palestinian human rights, and we will keep further sanctions under review."
"Mr. Speaker, let us talk about integrity. Today, our Conservative Party introduced a motion demanding that the $64 million that was overpaid to GC Strategies in exchange for zero services be returned to Canadians. Will the Liberal ministers of the past 10 years, who approved this payment to their friends, finally show some integrity by supporting our motion to force GC Strategies to return the money and to ban this company not for seven years, but for life?"
"Mr. Speaker, that was a thoughtful question. As I said in my speech, I think the climate crisis is the defining issue of our times. There are thousands of issues in politics, but some are existential, and the climate crisis is one of those. I think it is incumbent upon us as a Parliament to take effective measures that reduce Canada's carbon emissions in an effective way and meet the international obligations that we have committed to in treaty. That means looking for every single mechanism that we can to reduce carbon in a way that protects our planet and our environment and operates in a fair manner. New Democrats believe that the price on pollution is one measure in that regard. I think it is also time for us to explore other mechanisms, like the cap-and-trade system, which has worked well to reduce the sulphur dioxide problem in the Great Lakes. As well, we need to work with industries to make sure that we can adopt technologies so that industries can start making the reductions in carbon that are so necessary to protect our planet."
"I rise today to recognize and commend an exceptional young student from my district, Addyson Pannell, for being named Best STEM Student by Constituting America. Addyson's achievement reflects not only her academic excellence, but also her passion for the principles that form the foundation of our Nation. By combining her talents in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics with a deep understanding of civic responsibility, Addyson embodies the kind of engaged, thoughtful, and innovative citizen our future depends on. Constituting America is a nonprofit organization dedicated to educating students about the U.S. Constitution and the importance of civic engagement. Addyson's recognition as Best STEM Student highlights her outstanding contributions to promoting these values through creative, STEM-based solutions and projects. Her commitment to excellence and civic education is an inspiration to her peers and a source of pride for her community. On behalf of the 12th Congressional District of Texas, I am proud to recognize Addyson on this prestigious accomplishment. I am confident that her future holds even greater achievements, and I look forward to seeing the continued impact she will make. I congratulate Addyson on this well-deserved honor and for serving as a shining example of youth leadership in America."
"My constituent's child was the victim of a serious sexual offence several years ago. By the time the case comes to trial next year, it will have been nearly half a decade since the assault took place. Does the Lord Chancellor think that that is an appropriate length of time for a child to have to wait to seek justice? What words of comfort can she give to my constituent?"
"Order. I am really bothered, because we have only got to question 8, and I still need to call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson."
"The digital inclusion action plan is one of things I am proudest of. Only this morning I launched the ""IT reuse for good"" charter. One thing that is really problematic for many families who do not have access to the internet is that they simply do not have a device. I urge every Member of the House to get every business they know to sign up to the ""IT reuse for good"" charter so that we can get devices to the people who really need them."
"Oh, oh!"
"The Minister is listening, and I am sure she will respond positively to the hon. Lady when the time comes. SEN is not about writing off a child's ability, but about ensuring that they find their place in the system in order to achieve their potential. The second part of my Presbyterian sermon is about the stats for Northern Ireland. I know they are not the Minister's responsibility, but I will give some figures and talk about a solution that I hope might be helpful. In Northern Ireland, SEN costs PS65 million a year, but that figure is about 14% less than what is needed this year. The number of children with special educational needs has risen since 2017 from some 18,000 to some 27,000. In the same period, the number of children enrolled in special schools increased by some 25%. Funding is not meeting need, and we must look at other ways of doing that. The Department of Education in Northern Ireland is looking at units attached to mainstream schools, which provide a best-of-both-worlds approach. I hope that that solution can be of some help. The Department is looking at how well that can enable children to be a part of mainstream and better equipped to move forward. The units provide additional specialist facilities on a mainstream school site for pupils with an EHC plan. They focus on specific needs such as speech, language, communication or autism. The classes are smaller, and there are more teachers to help each student. The teachers are trained to work with pupils in the designated area of need, the classrooms are adapted to suit pupils' needs and the pupils spend a minimum of 50% and a maximum of 100% of their teaching and learning time in the unit, joining mainstream peers' classes when appropriate. That is one of the solutions that Northern Ireland Education Ministers and education authorities have come up with to try to address the issue when funding is lower. I am conscious of time, so I conclude by saying  that perhaps that unit approach is the way forward. I hope that there will be buy-in from staff throughout the United Kingdom. The goal is a UK-wide education system that is fit for all and accessible for all needs. The pressure is great, but so too is the reward in teaching, and we need to find a way to get the greatest reward for our teachers, classroom assistants and all who are involved in school life. That can only come with appropriate Government support, which I know the Minister is always ready and willing to give."
"Before I do, I will say that because my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch is the Chair of the Liaison Committee, I wonder if it would be useful if she and I met in the next few days with the Chairs of the two most relevant Committees to discuss precisely what shape all that should take and what would be useful and informative, rather than doing anything that might undermine the process."
"I rise today to discuss fatherhood. We must honor the amazing fathers throughout these buildings and across the Nation. As a Congresswoman, founder of the 5000 Role Models of Excellence, and chair of the U.S. Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys, I continue to celebrate and uplift fathers. I proudly join my colleague Representative Burgess in a bipartisan fashion to promote building stronger families through fatherhood. Still, too many families are broken due to State and Federal policies resulting in mass incarceration. We must address the many facets of public policy that hinder Black fatherhood. Organizations like the Jack Brewer Foundation play such a vital role in ensuring fathers and father figures have the tools they need to raise our children. Today, we proudly recognize the Jack Brewer Foundation of Florida. It is all about prevention, not detention. That starts with all of us."
"The Bill before the House has the potential to be one of the most pro-growth pieces of legislation passed by this place for decades and to transform our country for the better, but the amendments proposed will blunt its impact and make us all worse off. We should reject them for the prosperity of our constituents and the future of our country. Every day in this place has to be about our constituents and the lives they lead. In Chipping Barnet, time and again I see the impact of our failure to build homes. Take Maryam--a victim of domestic violence and mother of a seven-year-old, working a zero-hours contract. She found herself with nowhere suitable to live to the point that she was living in a car. Or take Hayley--a wheelchair user living in a property that is not accessible for her. Due to a lack of available housing that is appropriate for her, she is often housebound because she simply cannot leave her home without support. These are the stories of Britain today, but it does not need to be like this. This Bill gives us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix many of the things holding our country back. For too long, we have not built enough in this country, and we are paying a huge price for that. Under-investment in our homes and infrastructure has made us all worse off, both financially and socially, living in homes that skewer the prospect of a good life. That is why I do not support the Opposition amendments. I also do not support amendment 69 proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for North East Hertfordshire (Chris Hinchliff), which sadly misses the mark. Labour was elected on a manifesto that sought to prioritise growth and making people better off. The Bill demonstrates how that is possible, alongside improved protections for nature. The nature restoration fund is a genuine win-win, but its successful and timely implementation is put at risk by the amendment."
If he will make a statement on his departmental responsibilities.
"Mr. Chair, this exchange will age if the rate should happen to exceed 7%. Ordinarily, these projections would be in a budget that would be tabled in March or maybe April at the latest, so this is ordinarily something the government would project. Is the minister giving an assurance to this House that the unemployment rate will not exceed 7%?"
"My hon. Friend will know that we are already committed to rolling out breakfast clubs in every primary school. We want to ensure that there is more money in parents' pockets through our childcare entitlement roll-out. More broadly, the child poverty strategy will be ambitious on improving outcomes and life chances for every young person."
"I declare that I am an ambassador for Leeds Women's Aid. I welcome, as do my constituents in Leeds North West, the proposed changes to the victims' right to review scheme that are being piloted, which will give victims a greater say in their cases. Will the Solicitor General outline the specific way in which those changes will help victims and what the impacts will be?"
"I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend. Indeed, St Luke's hospice in my constituency will be facing exactly the same issues. At risk of closure is Tubb pharmacy in Newton Ferrers in my constituency, which I have raised in this place before. Pharmacist Esi has been helped massively by an incredibly active community. The pharmacy supported a petition I delivered here in Parliament, and it provides essential services to the two rural villages of Newton Ferrers and Noss Mayo, but it is seeking Government action in order to secure its future. While the estimates may highlight a commitment to delivering care closer to home, according to Community Pharmacy England there is still no clear path to the sustainable funding and operational model that is required by community pharmacy. It is needed by community pharmacies such as Tubb in Newton Ferrers, and it is needed by community pharmacists such as Esi. It is needed by the whole country to be able to deliver community pharmacy, Pharmacy First and, ultimately, to relieve pressure on primary care. I urge the Minister to provide this substantial funding for community pharmacy. I know that the Minister agrees that this work is incredibly important, and I urge her to ensure that we bring it to the fore as quickly as possible so that there can be a future for community pharmacy across the country."
"I thank the Foreign Secretary for the tone of his statement and the tributes he paid to not only his predecessors, but the officials and diplomats who have been involved in the negotiations for many years. I do not think I heard an answer to the question asked by the shadow Foreign Secretary, which was: can a British citizen flying from the UK to Gibraltar now be stopped by a Spanish official as they land? On the sovereignty clause, will he clarify whether it means that Spain has abandoned its claim altogether, or does it plan to follow the same route that Mauritius did with Diego Garcia?"
"Mr. Chair, to be clear, is there any scenario where a foreign government would be allowed to select, fund or control Canadian mining or processing projects on Canadian soil without full Canadian oversight and control?"
"There are not specific criteria and provisions in this Bill, but I can assure my hon. Friend that my ministerial colleagues and I are very aware of those issues. Although school-only bus provision is provided in a slightly different way, I would be happy to talk to him about the particular issues in his constituency. I want to say something about accessibility. For many, buses are a route to a better, more independent life, yet the current patchwork quilt of standards and regulations can further disable passengers, rather than enable them. That will change through this Bill, because local authorities will be required to produce a bus network accessibility plan and to consult disability organisations on changes to services, as I said earlier. New statutory guidance will make stopping places more accessible, including floating bus stops, which came up earlier. However, after listening to concerns, we will press pause on those that are perceived to be poorly designed."
"Mr. Chair, it is public, and I would be happy to, but there will be more questions. I am sure the member can look at the estimates, and she would know."
"I thank the Minister for what I think is her triple shift at the Dispatch Box today. A few months ago, I met three really great young lads--Benjamin, Eli and Jack. We had a great conversation, and they had me laughing and joking along with them for a very long time. I slightly disappointed Eli when I first opened my mouth because, listening to me, he recognised where I was from, and he asked if I could introduce him to Sam Fender. The north-east is quite small, but I do not know everyone, and I could see the disappointment on his face. One of the things we talked about was what they want to do in the future. Eli is considering being a musician, and Jack said he would like to do something involving public speaking or, who knows, even be a politician. It was really great to see that level of ambition, but for me it was tinged with sadness; I knew that they were unlikely to realise their ambitions, because Benjamin, Jack and Eli are unlikely to see their 30th birthdays. Benjamin, Jack and Eli all have Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It is a disease that affects only boys, and about 100 baby boys are born with it every year. Diagnosis is normally at the age of three or four, and at that moment the parents find out that their son has a life-limiting condition that cannot be treated, and that he will probably need a wheelchair by the age of 12 and a ventilator by the age of 20. There is no cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but there is hope now with a new drug called givinostat. Givinostat was developed by an Italian company, Italfarmaco, and it is an example of the brilliance of our UK life sciences sector that it decided to develop the drug here in the UK. As it has been trialled here, Italfarmaco has given the national health service a unique option to prescribe givinostat through an early-access programme entirely free of charge. The NHS can offer this drug to boys in the UK completely free of charge, and the early-access programme has been available since November last year. Members might think that such an opportunity would be seized quickly by the NHS, but sadly it has not been. Many families have had their hopes raised, only for them to be dashed when they find that they cannot access the treatment. Patients, families and charities are now calling for urgent access to givinostat, as are many Members of this House. My constituent Tracy is one of the many who have been fighting for their child's right to live, and for the treatment that has been proven to slow down the progression of Duchenne. Her son, Tom, is 14 years old, and she tells me that he is deteriorating. Givinostat has market authorisation for all boys with Duchenne over the age of six. It has been proven to slow its progression in clinical trials. It is not a cure--the families realise it is not a cure--but it could help boys and young men to keep walking and use their muscles for longer."
"The hon. Member will understand that we cannot talk about sharing military intelligence on the Floor of the House, but as he and I have an interest in this, I would be happy to have a conversation with him."
"I want to thank the Chair. Clearly, the voices of my colleagues and I are calling this what it is, which is a crossroads for this body. One of our Members--it matters not what their party--who was in their State was forcibly removed when he was asking for accountability from the executive branch. He was taken out of that room forcibly by multiple men, who then--even when he identified himself, even when he was pulled out of that room, he was then forced to the ground, pushed upon his face, his hands wrenched behind his back, and he was put in restraints. This is a crossroads for this body. This is not a partisan issue; it is one about who we are as a body. Will we let the abuses of the executive branch physically take a Member of this body and drive them to the ground and put them in restraints? And why? Why? Well, we are starting to get answers already. Here is Tricia McLaughlin, who is the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. This is her statement.  Senator Padilla chose disrespectful political theatre and interrupted a live press conference without identifying himself or having his Senate security pin on as he lunged toward Secretary Noem. Mr. Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers' repeated commands. @SecretService thought he was an attacker and officers acted appropriately.  The statement concludes that:  Secretary Noem met with Senator Padilla after and held a 15 minute meeting.  We know this is not true because we hear with our own ears on the tape Senator Padilla identifying himself; further ``disrespectful political theatre'' is not a justification to remove a U.S. Senator in their own State at a public press conference and violently push them out of the room, drive them to the ground, put them on their stomach, and handcuff them. Disrespectful behavior? This is our democracy. You have a right to speak up. You have a right to free speech. You have a right to stand and do the job that you swore an oath in this Chamber to do, to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. And one of your jobs is to provide a check and a balance to the administration. One of your jobs is to give accountability to the administration. I know the other 99 Members of this body, and if disrespectful behavior is a justification for violent reprisal from the administration, how many Members of this body--how many Members of this body--would be subjected to that? This is a farce of a justification and, therefore, we are at a crossroads. Will my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--will my Republican colleagues--justify the treatment of one of the Members of this body, justify the violence against one of the Members of this body, justify a Member of this body being thrown upon the ground and put in handcuffs--for what? For disrespectful behavior. If you think it stops with one, you are inviting it for the all because it does not. You are inviting it for every Member of this body. If the Obama administration or the Biden administration said that a Senator on the other side of the aisle was being disrespectful and threw that Senator violently onto the ground and put him into handcuffs, this body would be full of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle condemning what the Biden Justice Department did or the Obama Justice Department. This should not be about partisanship; this should be about patriotism. This should not be about tribalism; it should be standing up and being a leader in this moment. This is wrong. This violence is wrong. But let me be more personal. I tried to understand why this particularly upset me, and I think my colleague from Delaware spoke to that because of Alex Padilla's reputation in this body of being a kind and gentle person. We all know him, the goodness and the decency that he has. He is not one of the louder Senators. He is not one of the performative Senators. He has a reputation, as my colleague from Delaware said, on both sides of the aisle for being a gentle man. But I think what was really hard for me to see was that a Member of this body was driven to his knees and made to kneel before authorities. That is what got me. I think when I saw him driven to his knees forcibly, something there got me. You see, we know Alex Padilla's story. It is an unusual story for this body. His family came here as Mexican immigrants. His father was a short-order cook. His mother cleaned homes. They did those jobs that don't alwayscome with esteem or respect. They did those jobs where, when people see them, they sometimes look down on them. They did those jobs that are often marginalized despite their dignity. They raised their son to serve. He went to MIT. They raised their son to work hard, to show grit, to rise. They got to watch their son become a city councilperson in L.A. They got to watch their son ascend to be the secretary of state for California. They got to watch their son come to this body. And this son of Mexican immigrants who cleaned homes and served food, this man with equal dignity in this body, today, was driven violently to his knees as if made to kneel before the authority of the executive because he was so-called disrespectful. That should offend the consciousness, not just of the other 99 Members of this body, it should offend the conscience of this country because if you can make Alex Padilla forcibly kneel before this executive, when does it stop? He is a U.S. Senator. And if you can force him to kneel to his knees violently, when does it stop? What does it say to other Americans who want to speak up? What does it say to other Americans that want to exercise their constitutional duty? What does it say to other Americans this weekend when they want to peacefully protest? What does it say to other Americans from humble backgrounds who know poverty, that if a U.S. Senator who stands up to do his job can be made to heel, driven to his knees, violently handcuffed, what does it say? What message does it send?  Everybody in this body should see that this is a crossroads. They treated a Member of the U.S. Senate violently after he identified himself; dragged him out of the room, threw him upon the ground, and put him in handcuffs. Every Member of this body should object to that. Why? Because the statement was that he was disrespectful. That is unacceptable. That is offensive. That is un-American. So why is there silence right now? Why aren't my colleagues saying--I don't care if it is a Republican, a Democrat, or an Independent, when you drive a man to his knees in the United States of America, that is wrong, that is wrong, that is wrong. This is a test. This is a crossroads. This is a day in which the character of this body will be defined. Alex Padilla, a man of infinite decency, generosity of spirit, who, whether you disagree with him or not, is so well-liked in this body, who today, in a time of understandable outrage in Los Angeles, went to be with his constituents to get answers. And when he walked into a room and saw a Cabinet Secretary and raised his voice to ask questions, he was met with violence. They heaped upon him indignities. They drove him to his knees and then to his face and they put him in cuffs. Well, they didn't just assault the physicality of Alex Padilla, they did not succeed in assaulting his dignity. I know he rose off that ground with the same dignity he had before they threw him upon it. What they assaulted today is the dignity of this body. What is in question now is a truth of who we are and what we stand for. This is an abuse of power. This is a violent act unjustifiably taken on a Member of this body. The question is, Who will we be as a Senate? The question is, How will we respond? Will we defend this institution or will we yield to the tactics of authoritarian, violent leaders? I see my colleague here from Maryland. I yield the floor."
"Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of support in the country for this brilliant piece of legislation, which would create one economy, not 13, and would move us toward creating great national projects that will create jobs. I know that the member will stand with me and with the men and women in Canada's labour movement, who have stood up, day after day after day after day, to support this legislation, to say that it will create jobs, that it will create opportunity for the skilled trades, that it will create a future for them and their children. Will he stand with those unions? Will he stand for—"
"Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General reconfirmed what we already know: The Liberals are bad with Canadians' money. With respect to housing, the Liberals promised to build 4,000 units in six years, but the real number is a pathetic 309. The F-35 budget has exploded by $14 billion, and there are no pilots to fly the jets. Worst of all, the Liberals funnelled $64 million to arrive scam contractors, just two guys working from their basement, with no proof they did any real work. They are the same Trudeau ministers, the same failures and the same old Liberals. Why did the Prime Minister promote the very ministers responsible for these scandals into his cabinet?"
"Mr. Chair, is it true that, if an owner increases the cost of rent, the CMHC gives them more funding?"
"I thank the right hon. Member for those questions. I hope he will appreciate, not least because of the quasi-judicial nature of the role of planning Ministers in the planning process, that I cannot comment on the details of the application. As I have said, no decision on the case has been made, and the case is not yet before the Department. The right hon. Member mentioned cables, but it would not be appropriate to comment on any specific national security issue. On whether the Chinese embassy issue was raised during UK-US trade talks, again it would not be appropriate to comment on the details of those talks. Suffice it to say that we do not recognise the characterisation set out in The Sunday Times article, in which that was referenced. It is important to emphasise that only material planning considerations can be taken into account in determining this case. As I say, I cannot comment in any detail on such a case, and this case is not yet before the Department."
"This 138-page industrial strategy highlights the key problem facing British industry: high energy prices. The Secretary of State is putting in place some measures to reduce them, but surely he could do that earlier than 2027 by removing some of the green levies of net stupid zero sooner. When will energy prices come down for all of British industry?"
"Mr. Speaker, what if I said the government had a plan to increase the cost of vehicles by over $20,000 and kill 40,000 high-paying Canadian jobs? Well, that is exactly what the Liberals are doing with their mandate to eliminate gas-powered vehicles, which starts to take effect next year. Workers and families across Canada, especially in rural and northern communities, cannot afford this dangerous Liberal experiment. It is simple: Canadians do not want this shoved down their throats. Tonight, will the Liberals vote to end their radical ban on gas-powered vehicles immediately?"
"Madam Speaker, I sat as a municipal councillor, and this was a source of great discussion around the council table. Incidentally, I was on a plane this morning with someone from the development community, and we had a discussion about development charges. It is going to be an ongoing conversation of great importance between federal, provincial and municipal partners. It is also important to keep an eye on the long-term future, because if we can increase housing supply through the incentivization of decreasing development charges, there are going to be more homes to collect property taxes from for our municipalities."
"Mr. Speaker, I have not yet had many opportunities to work with my colleague, but I think she is well liked here in Parliament. I think she can appreciate that using a word like “scammed” is a bit of an exaggeration. I would like her to consider the fact that Canadians asked us to do this. This is the mandate that Canadians sent us here to carry out. We won 44 seats in Quebec because Quebeckers also want us to build an economy that works for all Canadians. I am sure they would not be pleased to hear the word “scammed” being used in the House today."
"Mr. Speaker, the people in my riding will benefit when taxes go down. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has confirmed that the government's wasteful spending is costing Canadians $70 billion in interest payments just on the debt. That is more than it is spending on health care. The Liberals are back to their old ways of breaking promises. They broke their promise to cap spending at 2% and increased it to 8%. They broke their promise to cut spending on Liberal consultants and increased that by $7 billion. When will the Prime Minister produce a budget and stop wasting taxpayer dollars?"
"Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, we need to make sure, as we build ourselves as an energy superpower, that the energy we are producing is low-risk, low-cost, and low-carbon. In fact, that makes us more competitive as a market to people who want to purchase our products. Countries are looking to us to be able to fulfill exactly that type of energy: low-risk, low-cost, low-carbon."
"The Minister knows from his time at the Local Government Association of the impact that asylum has on the budgets of local authorities. With the Home Office's much-vaunted increase in the grant rate for asylum claims, the Government are pushing thousands of households on to council waiting lists and shunting millions in costs on to council tax payers. What additional funding and measures does he aim to secure to help to mitigate those costs, which are affecting so many of our local authorities?"
"No? If the Government simply mean teachers with qualified teacher status, then I gently remind the Minister of something we covered in Bill Committee, which some colleagues might recall. The number of teachers today who do not have qualified teacher status is 3.1%, which does not sound all that high. What do colleagues suppose it was in May 2010, the previous time that there was a change of Government? The answer is 3.2%. So the number of teachers without qualified teacher status has hardly changed, and to the extent that it has, it has slightly gone down. We know that other RDEL--revenue spending, effectively--is going up, but it has to cover an awful lot. There is PS1 billion-plus in national insurance contribution costs. We know from reports from teachers and headteachers in the sector press that shortfalls in the range of 10% to 35% are being reported. School suppliers are also facing higher national insurance contributions, which will also have a knock-on effect on the cost of other services into those schools. Schools are also picking up the cost of breakfast clubs, and there is an extension in free school meals eligibility and so on. Overall, if we look at the detail in the estimates and the spending review, all these increases are front-loaded--that is to say, for 2024-25 the increase is 6.8%, but that then comes down to 5.2% the following year, and then 3.4%, then 2.1%, and then 1.6%. The main point I put to the Minister--constructively and co-operatively--is that things are changing significantly in schools because of demographic change. We have reached a point where I do not believe it is legitimate to use the measure of real-terms per pupil funding as the yardstick for whether effective school resourcing is increasing or decreasing. That is because the number of pupils will fall. We know already from TES, which used to be called The Times Educational Supplement, that surplus secondary places have increased by some 50% in just  two years. Labour MPs may well argue--and I kind of hope they do--that when there is a smaller number of children there will obviously be less funding, and there is some logic to that argument, but in a sense it does not matter what arguments they make in this Chamber, because back in their constituencies, if they talk to headteachers, they will hear something different. When pupil numbers are rising, if real-terms per pupil funding is held constant, that is a net increase in resourcing to the school. When numbers are falling, and even if real-terms per pupil funding is increased by a few per cent, that feels very much like a cut. Let us think about it in the following practical terms. If a primary school class of 27 goes up to 29, that is an increase in revenue to the school of something like PS10,000, PS11,000 or PS12,000, but the vast majority of costs do not change. It works the same way in reverse. If a class moves from 29 pupils to 27, the school loses PS10,000 to PS12,000, but there are still the same costs, and the teacher is still being paid the same and so on. In an urban setting, some whole schools may close--some already have. That is a painful process to go through, and no MP wants to represent an area where schools close, but at least that way the numbers can be made to work over a wider area, and some of those schools can convert to nursery schools, I hope, or to special schools. A big secondary school might reduce, say, from an eight-form entry to a six-form entry and manage the numbers that way. For a rural primary school, neither of those things is an option. There are major indivisibilities. Right now, 92% of DFE funding for schools is driven by pupil numbers, and I just do not think that will work over the years ahead. What will Ministers do to reform funding so that it is fair and effective at a time of falling overall pupil numbers?"
"I thank my hon. Friend for his question. I reassure him that the Government stand ready for any eventuality and will take action as required. We are not looking at nationalisation because it would cost over PS100 billion of public money, which would have to be taken away from other public services, such as the national health service, to be given to the owners of the water companies. It would take years to unpick the current model of ownership, during which time pollution would get worse. We know that nationalisation is not the answer, because we need only look at the situation in Scotland to see that."
"Nothing matters more than home, so I welcome the huge progress that has been made on  forces housing over the past 12 months, especially for forces families. Does the Minister agree that the Opposition's half-baked reprivatisation plan would be a huge threat to those in the armed forces and their families?"
We are not.
"Mr. Speaker, thank you for reminding the member that we cannot identify who is here and who is not. However, I can say that I am here from the NDP and I am happy to take her question."
"We are completely and utterly not complacent, and we are determined to ensure that creators are remunerated for their work. We would never surrender other people's labour to a third party. I know that the hon. Member used to be the editor of Cruise International, and I very much hope that as a former journalist she will help us develop policies that can answer the question she asked."
"I refer Members to my entry in the Register of Members' Financial Interests, as I am a councillor on Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council. Local government funding is in crisis, from social care to special needs, homelessness to high streets. Our councils--whose work impacts us all and who are the backbone of local service delivery--are being pushed to the brink. While the estimate sounds positive, it is way more complicated, just like the work that councils do. The lack of funding is not a new problem. The hollowing-out of local government has been happening for a decade. In my home councils of BCP and Dorset, central funding through the revenue support grant was slashed by between 95% and 98% over that time. The Government's announcement that central funding for councils with low tax bases will be weighted sort of misses the point. Many councils in the south receive no revenue support grant and are already raising their council tax by the maximum 5% each year. The Government need to talk to the councils they are targeting and review this proposal before they create a new problem. Local areas are dealing with ageing populations and soaring house prices, and councils risk having no choice but to take money directly from services for the poorest, sickest and most vulnerable. The three-year settlements are welcome to help planning, and the headline PS13.5 billion increase in Department funding by 2028-29 sounds positive, but measured against 2025-26 it is actually a real-terms cut of 0.6%. While MHCLG's day-to-day spending will rise by PS2.5 billion, much of this comes through transfers. For example, much of the PS857 million for adult social care is reallocated from children's social care, and the PS515 million to cover increased national insurance contributions does not cover the demand. Adult social care is now the largest spending area for upper-tier authorities. Meanwhile, tensions between the NHS and councils over who funds the sick and elderly are growing, leaving families stuck in the middle. Carers bear the brunt, often being forced to choose between caring and working, which has knock-on effects on the wider economy and carers' wellbeing. The situation is made worse because independent providers are not covered for the NICs increase. The Nuffield Trust estimates that the increase in national insurance will cost independent  social care employers PS940 million this year. Many are handing back contracts, unable to make the numbers add up, which is piling pressures on to councils. I urge the Minister to look closely at the impact of this change. The Liberal Democrats want a social care workforce plan, a royal college of care workers to improve recognition, and a higher carer's minimum wage. We call on the Government to complete the Casey review within one year instead of three. The elderly, disabled and our NHS deserve better than further delay. The crisis extends beyond adult care, affecting our youngest children too. SEND provision is, as we know, inconsistent and underfunded. Parents are exhausted, teachers are overwhelmed, and children are being left behind. We are relieved, rather than happy, that the statutory override will continue for another two years, because many councils would face insolvency within months without it, but this merely defers the inevitable. As debts outgrow reserves, councils cannot invest in their communities or drive local growth. The upcoming White Paper must guarantee every child with an EHCP the support that works for them, make mainstream education more inclusive so that children can stay close to home with their peers, and urgently reform the funding formula. The funding formula does not work. In some areas, the annual base funding per pupil is PS2,500 less than in others. Schools have to fund the first PS6,000 for any special educational support, but some schools do not get PS6,000 a year for a pupil's whole education. The Liberal Democrats really are begging for that to be resolved. In specialist provision, I have seen independent settings charge more than PS100,000 to educate children with moderate needs when a state-maintained special school is doing the same for PS20,000; but, without alternatives, councils are forced to pay. The loss of the PS100 million rural services delivery grant was a huge blow to rural councils, so I welcome the consultation on reviewing that, but those councils face not just higher delivery costs but recruitment challenges. It was wrong for the Government to suggest that rural communities do not face the same deprivation--tell that to some of my constituents who have no mains gas and no sewerage, no job opportunities and are miles from anything. The Liberal Democrats welcome the PS267 million for rough sleeping and PS194 million for homelessness prevention, and we are pleased that that has been ringfenced, but without a target for social house building, councils remain burdened with the costs of temporary accommodation. It is not just about money: the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee's recent report revealed that temporary housing is detrimental to our children's health, with it being a factor in the deaths of 74 children, including 58 infants, in the last five years. It also damages the developmental, mental health and life chances of every child in that situation. We therefore welcome the PS39 billion investment in affordable housing, but we are disappointed to see how backloaded it is, meaning that many families will wait up to 10 years finally to get a roof over their heads. Finally, I want to address devolution. The Liberal Democrats support genuine devolution, so we are disappointed that the Government have cancelled funding for neighbourhood plans and are discouraging the formation of new town and parish councils where there is local government reorganisation. Instead, we are seeing  top-down area committees with no statutory powers. The spending review mentions funding for mayoral areas, but that benefits only those areas that are ready to go. What about the areas outside wave one such as Kent and Medway, or Wessex? Where is their support in the meantime? Our local councils deliver every day, but they cannot do it alone, so I urge the Government please to provide fair funding and real devolution for those areas."
"Madam Chair, my colleague will be pleased to see that in the main estimates for Finance Canada, 99% of the funds requested are for statutory programs. Only 1% of it is for the operation of Finance Canada."
A smart move.
"The right hon. Member is right to highlight that we need to provide support for older people, and for all households, with their energy bills right through the year, which is what this Government have been doing. We have not been waiting. As I said,  the warm homes discount is being extended to almost 3 million extra households, we are rolling out the improvements to the insulation programmes that I have just mentioned, and the household support fund has been extended for future years. That is exactly what we need to do, while at the same time improving our energy security and our energy generation to make sure that, in future, we do not see the disaster of the last five years, when global wholesale gas prices sent electricity and gas prices here in the UK through the roof."
"I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his remarks and the tone with which he made them, because in matters of war it is always important that this House can speak with one voice. On proscription, I refer him to the work of Jon Hall and remind him that we are dealing with state threats. To be absolutely clear, no country in the world is deploying more state threats across the world than Iran. That was why it was important to look at that issue specifically. He has found gaps in our architecture. We are looking at those gaps and we will come forward with our plans shortly. The hon. Gentleman rightly talks about the important work of negotiation and diplomacy, and what sits behind that. It is absolutely right that we continue to work with France and Germany. I reassure him that that work has continued and was continuing alongside--a parallel track, if you like--the work of President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff. We applauded that work and that effort to get to a negotiated diplomatic solution, but it is a  solution that will require Iran giving up its nuclear capability. It will involve Iran getting serious about what those centrifuges under mountains are really for. We are very serious about that; that is what we were insistent on, and why we said there would be a snapback and we would impose very severe sanctions--that those sanctions would hit Iran once again if we did not see compliance. The hon. Gentleman puts on record his views on Gaza. We have had those exchanges many times across the Chamber."
"I am sorry, but I cannot. I will tell him afterwards why I cannot, but I promise that it is not out of a lack of respect for his position. Some say that Northern Ireland is different, but why would we think that women in Northern Ireland are different from women in England and Wales when it comes to human rights? We are seeking not to remove our regulations, but to apply the same test to them. We simply want the Secretary of State to ask whether they are human-rights compliant. Those who celebrated bringing abortion to Northern Ireland, and who continue to promote it, did not just celebrate the provision of a service; they celebrated the liberation of women from this inequality, which we risk perpetuating for our constituents."
"had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 146."
"Mr. Speaker, as I rise today in Parliament as a first-time MP for Hamilton Centre, it is with deep gratitude to the people of Hamilton Centre. I thank them for placing their trust in me to serve as their member of Parliament. It is a huge honour to represent our vibrant, diverse and resilient community in this chamber. I also want to thank my wife, my children and the incredible team of volunteers and constituents who believed in me. Our government is committed to cutting taxes for the middle class, to affordable housing and to strengthening our economy. The people of Hamilton Centre deserve nothing less than a government that shows up, listens and delivers. I am here to do just that. I thank Hamilton Centre."

"I rise today to recognize the city of Delano, California as it celebrates its 110th anniversary. Incorporated in 1915, Delano was originally established as a railroad town, serving as a hub for hundreds of workers building the southern terminus of the Southern Pacific railroad. Over the years, Delano has been the site of several historically significant events, particularly during World War II. The Voice of America Delano even operated as a vital broadcasting facility, relaying news and information to VOA stations across the Pacific, including Hawaii, Okinawa, and the Philippines. In more recent history, the Delano Municipal Airport gained distinction as the home of a squadron of Northrop P-61 Black Widow aircraft--twin-engine fighters that played a key role in defending the Pacific Coast during the war. Today, Delano is best known for its thriving agricultural industry. The city is a majorproducer of grapes, oranges, almonds, pistachios, and cotton. Alongside its agricultural success, Delano has experienced steady commercial growth, attracting major businesses such as Wonderful Citrus, the company behind the widely popular Halos brand. Delano is also a culturally rich and diverse community, shaped by generations of residents from around the world. Since the arrival of early settlers under the Homestead Act, Delano has welcomed people from Latin America, Asia, and Europe, each contributing to the city's distinct character and traditions. Mr. Speaker, I ask my congressional colleagues to join me in celebrating Delano on its 110th anniversary, and to honor its rich history, diverse community, and the spirit of those who call it home."
"Madam Speaker, I know that new homes have 200 amps or more, but in Newfoundland, what percentage of homes would have less than 200 amps? To have a plug-in installed for an EV, 200 amps or more is required. If the case is that the majority do not have sufficient amperage and transformers around the province, will the member be asking for an “auto-immune system” for the province of Newfoundland and Labrador?"

"Mr. Speaker, the cost of groceries has skyrocketed. Unfortunately, 10 years of Liberal inflationary deficits have forced a record number of Canadians to use food banks. Unfortunately, I ran into a friend of mine from high school, François, there. He works, and he makes a budget, but he is unable to make ends meet. Children from my riding, in Victoriaville, go to school with an empty lunch box. There is nothing inside. Thank goodness we have organizations that take care of them. Will the Liberals finally table a budget to reduce inflation, lower taxes and put food on the table for our children?"
"moved that Bill C‑5, An Act to enact the Free Trade and Labour Mobility in Canada Act and the Building Canada Act , be read the third time and passed."
"Mr. Speaker, I am very honoured to be here as the new housing and infrastructure minister and to go forward with initiatives that will deliver affordable housing across Canada. We will look for the support of the members opposite. We will look for partnerships with all levels of government to deliver that. We will use all the tools of the federal government to deliver with “build Canada homes”. We have a lot of opportunities ahead of us. We have to stay focused and work together."
"Mr. Speaker, the government is going to make housing more affordable. We will increase the housing supply to lower costs. Together, we will build Canada strong."
This Government are committed to investing in local transport around the UK. I am pleased that we have been able to make such a substantial investment in bus services in my hon. Friend's constituency. Fylde council's business case found that there was potential to increase frequency on the south Fylde line. I know the Rail Minister would be happy to meet him to discuss the matter further.
I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.
"Mr. Speaker, this bill requires meaningful consultation with indigenous peoples, consistent with section 35 of the Constitution and the duty to consult. It would require consultation both during the process of determining which projects are in the national interest and, most important, once a project is selected during the permitting process. Both steps would require our indigenous partners. I look forward to continuing to engage with partners to ensure the success of the legislation and the involvement of indigenous peoples in moving our economy forward."
"Okay, go on."
"Mr. Chair, that is another excellent question. I jest a little, but only a little, because one of the things that is really heartwarming to see in Canada right now is the unity among premiers, Conservative premiers, Liberal premiers and NDP premiers, around the idea of getting rid of trade barriers between us. I hope all members of this House will join the premiers and join our government in supporting that initiative. I think in asking for that generosity, it behooves me and our government to be generous in turn. Let me offer a few name checks to Conservatives who have led the charge on interprovincial trade: Premier Tim Houston of Nova Scotia, with his mutual recognition approach, is doing a great job; Premier Doug Ford of Ontario, as head of the Council of the Federation, is also leading the charge; and I do want to recognize someone who was a colleague of some of us in this House, the Hon. Jason Kenney, who has been—"
"I am absolutely delighted that this announcement will see more than 2,000 extra children qualify for free school meals in my Banbury constituency. Can the Minister explain how this announcement will improve the educational attainment and behaviour of children in my constituency?"
"I rise to speak in support of amendments 21, 103, 104 and 42, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham  (Munira Wilson), the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Adam Jogee) and my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon (Mr Kohler). As other Members have said, this is a deeply consequential Bill. I want to record my thanks to the hon. Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater), to all members of the Bill Committee, and to all those who have contributed to its careful scrutiny through the tabling of amendments and debates over them. The Bill is about the end of life. It is an emotive and sometimes painful topic, and I am grateful to the many constituents who have generously shared with me their experiences and opinions. I have also taken some time to consult palliative care practitioners, including those providing hospice care in my constituency. Those conversations reinforced the awe and admiration I hold for these caring professionals. Their expertise and deep commitment are always impressive. Contrary to the points made by the hon. Member for Gosport (Dame Caroline Dinenage), they are adamant that they can provide sufficient pain relief to the vast majority of those receiving end-of-life care. The issue is about not the efficacy of treatment, but access to it. In this, I echo the powerful points of the hon. Member for East Renfrewshire (Blair McDougall) on the present inequality of access to palliative care. Amendment 21 would ensure that the availability, quality and distribution of palliative and end-of-life care is published within one year of the Act being passed. When assessing the provision of end-of-life care, it is critical that this House and the public can see how palliative care is being delivered. For the measures in the Bill to provide a genuine choice to those at end of life, palliative care must be much more widely available. The hon. Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater) argues that there should be no false choice between palliative care and assisted dying, yet she and health Ministers know that there is a choice as resources are limited. When so many hospices have closed beds due to funding shortages and receive more than 70% of their funding from donations, I am concerned that we may see significant expenditures on a new regime for assisted dying, funded by the state as a health treatment, while the palliative care sector and hospices in particular remain chronically underfunded."
"I am sure the leadership of HS2 would be very concerned to hear that description of the way that the project is engaging with local people. That is not what I expect of an infrastructure company, and I am sure it is not what the chief executive of HS2 Ltd would want either. I would be very happy to meet my hon. Friend."
"Mr. Speaker, my apologies for the interruption, but the hon. member has referred to a “new government”. The government has been in power for the last decade. I am wondering if he might correct that."
"Mr. Chair, the Liberals can keep laughing. The point is that they are saying they want to build Canada, but their antidevelopment policies make Canada, our workers and our businesses unable to compete globally. Actually, they are not going to help build Canada at all. What will the minister say to the families of the more than 50,000 people who will lose their jobs because of the only-one-in-the-world Canadian oil and gas cap?"
"Mr. Speaker, the member is talking to the wrong person asking that. We have brought historic investment into this country. I can think of major projects and major investments. We can look at Dow Chemical and Volkswagen coming into our country. We can look at these—"
Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
"Does the hon. Member agree that what he has just described would lead to more delays in the system, which would mean that more planning permissions were held up--something that Opposition Members  have complained about? If the amendment were passed, the requirement would also add a lot more expense to the system, which would mean more viability problems and fewer social homes being built."
That was a four-minute speech--thank you very much. I now call the Father of the House.
"Mr. Speaker, as I rise for the first time as the member of Parliament for Cape Breton—Canso—Antigonish, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the constituents of our riding for putting their trust in me as their representative. To my campaign team, I say that this journey would not have been possible without them. June is National Indigenous History Month in Canada. It is a month to celebrate indigenous culture. It is a time to reflect on our shared history, and it is a time to acknowledge the vast contributions of first nations, Inuit and Métis. National Indigenous History Month is also an opportunity to embrace indigenous events in our communities, hear the beautiful languages and support the work of indigenous arts and crafts. I encourage all Canadians to get involved in National Indigenous History Month this June. Wela'lioq . Meegwetch . Marsi . Nakurmiik ."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the fantastic question. They are all fantastic questions. I love being in the House. We are working to make sure those estimates are accurate. Numbers are changing rapidly with the pressure points, as we are in conversation around responding to the tariffs and as other elements have an impact on our global community. That work is under way. We will be delighted to come forward with that when the time is right, after we have done our homework to make sure that we can share this appropriately in the fall."
"The logic behind having a Women's Minister was the idea that women present and have different problems in society. By that logic, men and boys do, too; we know about suicide, and we have just heard about educational attainment. We hear about help-seeking opportunities, and I welcome the men's health strategy, but is it not time we had a Minister for men and boys to look across Government and deal with education, unemployment, suicide and health, and really get to grips with the problems facing young men and boys?"
The Minister is familiar with the campaign that I and neighbouring colleagues have been running for many years to improve the A180. When will she have some good news for us?
I call the shadow Minister.
"I thank the hon. Member for pointing out the failures of the previous Government, and their refusal to exempt domestic abusers and offenders who have committed violence against women and girls from their early release scheme; this Government ensured that measures were in place to ensure that victims were kept safe. He will know the importance of the new domestic abuse identifying tool that we are bringing forward. It is a vital for identifying and tracking data  through the criminal justice system, and it will be important as we go forward with the reviews that we are putting in place."
"This is a very sensitive issue. There is data to support the fact that people from minoritised ethnic groups are less likely to trust their health professionals--the figure is 18% among the general public, but as high as 30% among those groups. Does my hon. Friend not think it is necessary to make sure there are additional protections for those who face additional barriers, such as people from minoritised ethnic groups?"
"Madam Speaker, we are looking forward to moving forward with this. While I was outside of the House, I paid attention to what was going on, and it was the other side of the House that divided us on this issue. That is why we want to move forward for Canadians, families, children and seniors. We will continue to do that on this side of the House."
"Mr. Speaker, what we saw on Monday was 13 provinces and territories working together to build the strongest economy in the G7. The premiers and the government are focused on building a strong Canadian economy. What we are seeing from my colleagues across the floor are attempts to divide and to block development. I hope Conservatives will join us in building a strong Canada."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise once again to ask the Minister of Finance why he finds it acceptable to not table a budget before he and the Prime Minister , the so-called man with the plan, head off on summer vacation. Budgeting is not optional for families and small businesses across this great country, and it should not be optional for the federal government either. Months of uncertainty about Canada's finances will undoubtedly harm Canada's credit rating and spook investors into moving further capital out of this country. However, that should not surprise anyone, given the Prime Minister 's track record of moving capital and jobs out of Canada and over to his friends on Wall Street in New York City. The Prime Minister promised to cap spending at 2% but then immediately turned around and handed Canadians a tax bill that shattered the promise and jacked up spending 8%."
"I rise today to recognize our June Veteran of the Month, a new veteran, Colonel Keith J. Butler. Colonel Butler enlisted in the Air Force in 1991 and was selected for an Air Force ROTC scholarship in 1997. He earned his commission through the University of South Carolina and served in operational, staff, and command assignments as an F-16, F-117, and B-2 pilot. Colonel Butler has held positions at the squadron, group, wing, major command, direct reporting unit, and joint staff levels. He is currently the commander of the 509th Bomb Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base, home of the B-2 Stealth bomber, since June 2023, and he is retiring in just a few weeks. He has flown combat missions and held several other positions all over the world. He is decorated with many awards and is respected by many. I am proud to call Colonel Butler a friend. Mr. Speaker, I thank him for his bravery, service, and dedication to America. Congratulations on a well-earned retirement, Colonel Butler.  June Small Business of the Month In Full Bloom"
"Mr. Chair, what we have been doing over the last several weeks is meeting with the leaders of the energy proponents all across this country, renewables and conventional. They are telling us that they are supportive of the one Canadian economy act and would like these members to support it."
"Men, women and children in Gaza do not care that our Government have a profound disagreement with the Israeli Government. The Israeli Government do not care either, because they are continuing to act with impunity. It is quite simple: there is a genocide in Gaza being committed by the Israeli Government. We are complicit in that genocide. We have the power to act and we are not acting. What are we waiting for? Why have we not sanctioned Israel for its war crimes? Why have we not implemented a full arms embargo, including on F-35 fighter jet parts? Why have we not recognised the state of Palestine? We can do it, because rightly we did it for Ukraine. Why are we not treating Palestinian lives as equal?"
I will.
"Mr. Chair, can we just get real here? Can the minister explain what is different between the 2022 critical minerals strategy and the 2025 critical minerals pathway of the current government, which cannot actually develop or produce mines in time nor be competitive with other countries? What actually is the difference, and why should Canadians believe the Liberals now?"
"Presumably, the outcome of the Timms review will require some form of primary legislation to enact the changes to the system that will come from the Department for Work and Pensions. In which case, I suggest to the Minister that removing clause 5 from the Bill tomorrow and putting it into any future legislation means the Department can still have its thresholds in the future if it wants to, but only once everybody knows against what criteria those judgments will be made."
"I rise to celebrate the new fire station that just opened off of Route 50, Station 7. This new 23,000-square-foot facility is replacing the previous fire station that was built in 1971 and will provide crucial, lifesaving services to over 6,000 residents, covering over 40,000 square miles of response area. Station 7 will be staffed around the clock by career and volunteer firefighters and respond to calls of all types, medical, fire, and even wildland support.  The work that these first responders do is critical, and they keep all of us healthy, safe, and protected; putting their lives on the line for the benefit of the community. As a former volunteer firefighter myself, I thank the crews operating out of the new Aldie Fire Station for their service and dedication to our community.  Effects of Big, Ugly Bill on Virginians"
"Mr. Speaker, as has been expressed in debate today, Conservatives have deep concerns with two omissions in the bill. First, there is no consecutive residency requirement in the bill, which means somebody way down the generational chain could claim Canadian citizenship with no significant ties to Canada and no obligations to the country. The second thing is that there is no security vetting prior to the granting of citizenship. Would my colleague entertain reasoned and smart amendments to rectify these deficiencies in the bill?"
"Mr. Speaker, good morning."
"A victims' representative was on the panel that conducted the independent sentencing review, which gathered views from victims and survivors. I personally met a number of victims and victim groups and fed their views directly back to David Gauke. Those serving sentences for more serious sexual and violent offences will spend at least 50% of their sentence in custody."
"Madam Speaker, I know that the member cares deeply about this issue. I hope she will support the piece of legislation, as it has been endorsed by many of our policing agencies as being important legislation. One organization I would like to mention in particular is the Canadian Centre for Child Protection. It has stated that the “proposed changes by the federal government...would reduce barriers Canadian police face when investigating the growing number of online crimes against children”. We have the full support of that organization, which has stated, and as we know today, that cybercrimes have evolved at a pace that government has not been able to keep up with. I wonder whether the member would agree with that, whether she finds that subscriber information and data privacy issues are really important, and whether it is really important to make these changes so we can keep up with the criminals."
"Does the hon. Gentleman agree with the advice from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Royal College of Midwives, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare and the British Medical Association, who all know much more than we do about the issue, to vote firmly against new clause 106, because it makes women more vulnerable?"
"Mr. Chair, it all depends on people's income, but for most Canadians, that is a challenge. That is why I hope the member will support us with our new housing plan."

"Mr. Chair, I am not sure what the phrase “the cost of government” indicates, but development cost charges need to be covered for the housing infrastructure, and how that is split between governments—"
"I welcome this announcement, and while there are aspects that I do not support, I particularly welcome the Government's investment in vital flood defences. As the Minister knows, these are critical in ensuring that we are better protected against the impacts of climate breakdown. With the Met Office warning this week that we could reach 45deg temperatures in the current climate, clearly the effects of climate breakdown are already here. Does he agree that protection needs to be fully integrated into every aspect of our economy--from housing to transport and farming--and does he also agree that it is a good idea to put climate resilience and preparedness on a  statutory footing by requiring all major infrastructure providers to carry out climate risk assessments in order to make us all safer?"
"I thank the chairman for his steadfast support, and I also thank the ranking member for his support. I rise today in support of H.R. 1664, the Deploying American Blockchains Act of 2025, bipartisan legislation that I am proud to lead alongside my colleague Representative Darren Soto. This bill is about far more than emerging technology. It is about securing America's future, economically, strategically, and technologically, in an increasingly digital world. Blockchain technology is not a passing trend. It is a foundational innovation that is reshaping how we think about security, identity, data integrity, and commerce. From supply chains and finance to healthcare and identity management, blockchain is transforming the way our systems function. Mr. Speaker, we are at a crossroads. While American entrepreneurs and technologists are ready to lead, they are operating in an environment filled with uncertainty. Too many innovators in this space face unclear rules, inconsistent Federal policies, and outdated frameworks that push investment and opportunities overseas. Meanwhile, nations like China are investing heavily in blockchain infrastructure and making it clear that their intent is to control the digital rails of the future. We cannot afford to fall behind. American values of freedom, transparency, and accountability must guide the development of the next generation of digital infrastructure. That is what this bill ensures. The Deploying American Blockchains Act takes a strategic, thoughtful approach by directing the Commerce Department to lead the Federal Government's blockchain effort. The Department will advise the President, establish a Blockchain Deployment Program, and ensure that the United States remains competitive in the development and application of this critical technology. Importantly, this bill affirms that blockchain is not just a buzzword. It is the backbone of next-generation innovations in areas like supply chain security, smart contracts, digital identity, and fraud prevention. These applications aren't just theoretical. They are being deployed right now across sectors of the entire American economy. If we fail to lead, others will step in to define the rules of the road.  This bill sends a powerful message to our allies and adversaries alike: America intends to lead. We will lead. We will build, not just consume. We intend to shape the global standards for digital trust and transparency, and we will not allow authoritarian regimes to do so in our absence. This bill is about leadership. It is about economic opportunity, and it is about protecting our American interests and ensuring that our technological edge continues to serve the people, our values, and our future. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting this commonsense legislation. Together, we can keep America at the forefront of innovation and ensure that our digital future is one defined by liberty, accountability, and American leadership."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Rivière-des-Mille-Îles for her commitment, and I welcome her back to the House. To build a strong economy with the most robust workforce in the G7, we need our young people to gain valuable work experience. That is why your new government is going further by creating up to 6,000 additional summer jobs for young people this summer, for a total of 76,000 jobs. I encourage young Canadians to apply for these exciting job opportunities."
"My hon. Friend is right to say that we lost thousands of jobs under the previous Government, whether in ceramics, chemicals or steel. The previous Government saw foundational industries through the rear-view mirror, but we know that these industries will forge our future. That is why we are rushing to get to clean energy by 2030 so that we can bring prices down, why we are supporting our industries through the supercharger, and why through the industrial strategy we are looking to provide more support, not less, to those crucial foundational industries."
"We have been very clear about the nature of the new aid arrangements involving the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. It has proven deadly and incapable of supplying aid at the levels so desperately needed. I have said so repeatedly, and we will continue to make these points with force."
"I warmly welcome the largest-ever capital investment in our NHS in the spending review yesterday, building on the Chancellor's  announcement in last year's Budget of the money to rebuild RAAC-infested hospitals such as Frimley Park hospital, which will benefit my constituents. That was committed to by the previous Conservative Government, but, shockingly, it was never paid for. With the Government standing four-square behind rebuilding Frimley Park hospital, does the Minister agree it is time for Frimley Health NHS trust to get on and announce the site for the new hospital?"
"As I speak, there is a removal van outside the illegal immigrant hotel in my constituency--let us hope they are moving them out, not moving more in. Can the Secretary of State assure my constituents that these illegal immigrants are not being dispersed in the community, being housed in houses in multiple occupation owned by private landlords, and will she advise me on where they will be housed?"
"Mr. Speaker, the government talks a lot about consultations in connection with its bill on so-called national projects. Would first nations simply be consulted, or would the government ensure that their free, prior and informed consent is obtained for any project that may potentially be imposed on them?"
"The Rapid Transition Alliance tells us that we can improve the quality of our roads if we support more people to use rail as a form of public transport. That is one reason why I am campaigning to restore the direct train between Eastbourne and  London Bridge that was discontinued during the pandemic. Will the Minister back my campaign, with a view to helping to improve our roads and improve economic growth for Eastbourne too?"
No. We are confident that the protections in place for the green belt--the tests that have to be met for grey-belt release--are robust. It is ultimately for local planning authorities to conduct green-belt reviews and to bring forward those sites as part of local plans.
"Daniel was a very happy and full-of-life 13-year-old boy in Fylde until, just over two years ago, he was diagnosed with a serious brain tumour. With multiple surgeries, a 70-week chemo treatment and, very sadly, a stroke while going through that treatment, Daniel has now been in hospital for over two years. He cannot move without assistance and requires assistance to breathe overnight. The local authority and the NHS have been working together with his family to help design how he can move home and live with his parents, but there is no funding available. He is falling through the cracks between different policies for the funding to pay for those changes, which the family simply cannot afford. May we therefore have a debate in Government time on how we can ensure that no family falls through the cracks in such a way and that children are not left inevitably in hospital, and on how to get Dan home?"
"Mr. Chair, as I said to our respected colleague from Quebec, I respect the jurisdiction of the provinces and I respect—"
"Mr. Speaker, we were always extremely clear and transparent throughout the election. We made two strong commitments: unify the Canadian economy, including by eliminating barriers to internal trade, and build major projects of national interest. Over 8.5 million Canadians voted for our plan, which enabled us to win 44 seats in Quebec. As a result, we now have exceptional new colleagues in the House. I want to ask my colleague the following question. Will he respect the will of voters, particularly those in Quebec, who asked us to strengthen and unify the Canadian economy, and will he vote in favour of Bill C‑5 ?"
"Mr. Speaker, on this side of the aisle, we will always defend the integrity of our procurement system, which is why we have put in place recommendations from previous reports of the Auditor General. We terminated all contracts with GC Strategies more than a year ago. We have revoked its security clearance. We have set up the office of supplier integrity, which has barred GC Strategies from contracting with the government for the next seven years. We have referred cases to the RCMP, and we have taken legal action against GC Strategies. Why? It is because we will never tolerate bad actors in our supply process."
"(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) Vote #5"
"Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I did not want to interrupt the member's petition, but I think this is worthwhile to review. When we present petitions, we are supposed to capture the essence of the petition and convey that to the House, not indicate whether we support or do not support the petition. I have noticed that we seem to get off track maybe a little too much on that issue, so I submit that just as a point, believing that maybe it is something the Speaker might want to review."
Will my hon. Friend give way?
"Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise on behalf of the people of Kamloops—Thompson—Nicola. One thing the minister and I agree on is safer borders and safer streets, but the really big area where I think we part company is how to do that. On the one hand, we have the Liberal approach, which is to talk about safer streets and safer borders and do little about that, and in fact do the contrary, in the form of Bill C-5 and Bill C-75 . Then we have the Conservatives, who want to take definitive action. We have an omnibus bill here; let us make no mistake about it. Why is there nothing in it about precluding fentanyl traffickers from serving their sentence at home and precluding people who use firearms from serving their sentence at home? Why are there no tough-on-crime measures like that, which are tangibly needed?"
"I rise today to recognize George Castro, who is retiring from the Senate after nearly 40 years on Capitol Hill-- a truly incredible contribution to this institution. George first started with the Architect of the Capitol in January of 1985 and has been faithfully contributing to the Senate ever since. Nowhere is this more true than on the Senate Appropriations Committee, where George has worked since November of 2003, almost 22 years ago. George's immense love for the work of the committee shone through in everything he did. Behind every successful committee hearing, markup, and event, there was George. He kept things running seamlessly, focusing on the details that were easy to forget, but certain to be noticed if missed. He did these things with a genuine and intentional kindness that is often in short supply, amassing a remarkable community of friends and colleagues along the way. Too cold in the hearing room? Emergency ice order for a retirement party? Incorrect name plate at a hearing? George could take care of it. He could count on his network to go out of their way to help him because he has spent a career going out of his way to help them. Staff can attest that when walking down the halls with George, he is often greeted by name from those who pass by--Senators, staff from across the Senate, the nurses from the health center, the sound engineers at the Senate Recording Studio, Capitol Police Officers--I could go on. My staff and I were lucky enough to have George's steady hand to help show us the ropes when I took over as chair of the committee in 2023, and I know the other chairs he worked for must have felt the same. That includes eight other committee chairs in addition to myself, Republicans and Democrats: Senators Stevens, Cochran, Byrd, Inouye, Mikulski, Shelby, Leahy, and Collins. In addition to his many other contributions, George has been known to regale committee staff with stories and lessons from some of the Senate's most pivotal moments in recent decades. He is also well known among his friends and colleagues for his love of travel and history and excellent taste in books, film, and the fine and performing arts. We will miss his many excellent recommendations along with his steady presence and positive attitude. On behalf of all of the past Senate Appropriations Committee members, my colleagues, and staff who were lucky enough to work with George, I want to thank him for his immense contributions to the Appropriations Committee and the Senate. He will be greatly missed, but we wish him all the best for the adventures ahead."
"I thank the Minister for his statement, which will be warmly welcomed by constituents, particularly pensioners who were just above the threshold and who lost out last winter. Does he agree that measures such as rolling out free breakfast clubs--I visited one this morning at Goodyers End primary school--are making a real difference by tackling poverty and that that is what this Government are doing across the board in all age groups?"
"a lot of people are asking the question: What exactly were people voting for in the last Presidential election? Well, many things. We have many citizens who are voters in this country, but the recurring theme seems to be the cost of living for the average family, the ability of mothers and fathers to make ends meet and to see a realization of their dreams and aspirations. We were told, over and over again, that families across this country were being overwhelmed by the cost of living--gas, groceries, housing. So they gave a majority of the votes to President Trump, who promised he would make America great again. Since taking office, I don't believe that the President has come near to keeping his promise. Instead, he has hired many of his billionaire buddies and cut deals with the ultrawealthy that will harm the same Americans who voted for him. I am not going to get into his cryptocurrency scheme and how it has enriched him and his family. Let's set that aside for a minute and talk about issues that apply to every person. Hidden in more than 1,000 pages in the bill that passed the House of Representatives is a plan--a laundry list of things--that I don't believe Americans even considered voting for in the last November election. They are going to have a devastating impact on families and States, red and blue alike. The main takeaway from this ``One Big Ugly Bill'': Billionaires are going to win, and American families are going to lose. Do you think the voters in last November's election for President of the United States would actually vote to close down their local hospital? That is what is looming. You say: Oh, you Democrats and your scare tactics--that can't possibly be true. Well, let me tell you what happened. Three weeks ago, 20 hospital administrators from across the State of Illinois--from Chicago down to the southernmost part of our State--all took a special trip to Washington to warn me that the bill that was pending before the House of Representatives threatened the survival of hospitals across our State. These are hospitals which are not only critical for providing professional medical care, delivering babies, and saving people's lives who are in automobile accidents but also major parts of the local economy. You come to rural, smalltown Midwest America and ask about the impact to the local hospital, and they will tell you: We don't know that we can keep a business or attract a business if we didn't have it. We count on it every day to be there when we need it. And, secondly, it is a major employer--infact, in most towns, the biggest employer in Downstate. Then they warned me: Many of these hospitals are hanging on by a thread. The money that they receive from government insurance programs like Medicaid keeps the doors open and the lights on and the doctors in town. And now we have a proposal from the Republicans to cut that Medicaid benefit for 16 million Americans. This would be the largest cutback in health insurance protection in the history of the United States. That is what has been sent over by the House of Representatives and is presently under consideration by the Republican leadership here in the Senate. Nationwide, half of all rural hospitals already operate in the red, and more than 300 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure--26 in Kansas, 22 in Alabama, and 9 in Missouri. How many closed hospitals will the Republicans accept as part of their plan? Let me tell you, I am from downstate Illinois--proud to represent the city of Chicago all these years but prouder still of being from downstate and trying to keep track of all the needs they have for this economy to prosper. I know rural hospitals are the backbone of many communities in downstate Illinois. Critical emergency medical care anchors the local economy. Now you dig deeply into this Republican budget bill that has come over from the House of Representatives, and it turns out they are not just eliminating health insurance coverage for 16 million Americans, they are also cutting Medicare. Medicare is a program primarily for elderly people in this country. It has been a miracle worker. Medicare was created in the 1960s, and it is no coincidence or surprise that the life expectancy of Americans went up as Medicare took root and became part of healthcare in America. Despite promising to leave Medicare alone, which everyone said, from Donald Trump on down, Republicans couldn't help themselves. They slashed Medicare benefits and reduced access to hospitals, nursing homes, and medications for seniors in all 50 States--Medicaid and Medicare. So why would Republicans in Congress take a wrecking ball to these two major parts of our healthcare system? To provide money from tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America. I will bet you that he is making it up. I will bet you it is another one of those political schemes of his. It is not being made up. It is true. They want to generate enough money to give tax breaks to wealthy people. Based on a new update from the Congressional Budget Office today, up to 16 million Americans are now estimated to lose their health insurance coverage under this Republican plan that passed the House and is now being considered by the Senate Republicans. I can just tell you this from a personal basis: There is no more helpless feeling in the world than to be a father with no health insurance and being told that your beautiful baby has a serious medical complication. I know. I have been there. Some Republicans are downplaying these catastrophic health cuts. On the Senate floor earlier today, a Republican Senator said people on Medicaid are lazy and play video games all day. At a recent townhall meeting, when a concerned constituent raised the Republicans' proposed Medicaid cuts and said that people would die, it became a controversy in response to the Senator's comment. It sounds like Republicans in Congress want to be the ones to decide who is worthy of healthcare in America. But Americans who depend on Medicaid are not strangers. They are your neighbors. They are people at your church, your school, and at your work. It probably is your family too. If you or a loved one gets sick, will congressional Republicans deem you deserving of seeing a doctor? Is that what this was all about? Is that what this election was all about? Did the American people vote for tax cuts for billionaires? I don't think so. A party like the Republicans, who claim they are the party of the working class--working-class billionaires--they refuse to put their money where their mouth is. Republicans in Congress may say they are just trying to lower your taxes, but most of the benefit is going to wealthy people who won't even notice it. Maybe their bookkeepers and accountants will be able to give them the good news that they just saved another $200- or $300,000 in taxes. Under the Republican plan, taxpayers in the wealthiest 0.1 percent would get a $300,000 tax cut every year--$300,000 for the richest of the richest in America. Why? At the expense of healthcare for 16 million Americans? It makes no sense. The average full-time worker making minimum wage on average would receive a tax break as well. I have to be honest about it. It is $20 a month. So $300,000 for the richest of the rich and 20 bucks a month for the working stiff. How can that possibly be fair? Did the American people vote to slash jobs across the economy in the last November election? I don't think so. Since we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, 85 percent of investment in clean energy technology has landed in Republican districts. Now, I know the President of the United States calls global warming and environmental issues a hoax. He has been hanging with that story for a long time even though we know something is happening. Notice the extreme weather events across the United States and around the world? They are getting more frequent and more costly. Is it a coincidence or is something going on? I happen to believe something is going on. In just 2 years since passing the Inflation Reduction Act, businesses have announced 340 new clean technology projects. One estimate says that these projects will create 150,000 permanent jobs. I have seen it in my State. That includes more than 9,000 jobs in Texas, 4,800 in Ohio, 4,500 in Indiana, and 2,700 in my home State of Illinois. The Republicans' ``Big Ugly Bill'' puts these jobs at risk, taking a hatchet to tax policy that makes these projects possible. The promise of a Republican repeal has already scared the private sector into withdrawing $14 billion in investment and canceling 10,000 clean energy manufacturing jobs. Why would the so-called party of the working class want to give their own constituents a pink slip? I don't get it. Now, some of my Republican colleagues have been brave enough to raise alarms about the Medicaid cuts, the rollback of clean energy credits, and the cost of the bill, but do you know what the cost of this bill is to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people? It is $3.8 trillion more on the deficit over the next decade. We already know the scammer in chief will try to bully Republicans into choosing billionaires over working families, using anything he can to persuade them or threaten them. My Republican colleagues must know that this plan does not make America great again; it makes our debt the greatest in the history of our Nation. Instead, it harms families in red and blue States looking for a fair shot. Their lip service to these terrible cuts is not enough. I urge a handful of my Republican colleagues--and that is all it takes--to show some courage, show some common sense, tell the folks in the House and tell the White House as well that this approach is not going to work. Taking health insurance away from 16 million Americans--more than has ever happened in the history of this country--is unfair, fundamentally unfair, and we all know it. We know intuitively that is just not fair. Taking Medicaid away from reimbursing hospitals and doctors of critical care in small towns and rural areas is a mistake we will pay for for generations to come. I urge Republicans to listen to their constituents because I know that Americans who voted for Trump in November did not vote for what I have just described today on the floor of the Senate. We need four Republicans--four--to stand up and say: This doesn't make sense--too much debt, too much pain for families, and too much of a gamble for rural areas in smalltown America. We have to stand up and make a much better effort, and we should do it on a bipartisan basis as quickly as possible. I yield the floor."
"Mr. Chair, the government has started to work with the departments to cut spending on professional services and travel by $500 million. In 2024-25, 2.3 billion was reallocated to priority areas, and this year, 2025-26, that amount will be increased to 3.5 billion. That work began in 2023 and is ongoing. The government is making sure that spending is being carefully managed and focused on our most pressing priorities. This year we are reallocating 3.5 billion to priority areas."
"Order. I am sorry to have had to be a little brutal, but we managed to get everybody in. We are, however, 10 minutes over time, so if Front Benchers exercised a little discretion, that would be helpful. I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson."
"Mr. Speaker, yes, these measures will be a tremendous boon to entrepreneurs in my riding. In my speech, I mentioned Backcountry Brewing, a brewery based in Squamish. Its beers are amazing, but they are not sold anywhere in Ontario. I could think of more examples. I know other companies that manufacture highly specialized materials for buildings. They will be able to sell their services and products here. I hope that this—"
"I am afraid not. Coroners investigate suspicious or violent deaths, or situations in which the cause of death is unknown. Assisted deaths would not fall into these categories, and there would therefore be no need for a default coronial investigation. This will ensure that any unnecessary delays and distress for bereaved families are avoided. These are not unexpected deaths; sadly, they were inevitable."
"I rise today to congratulate my constituent, Wyatt Spaulding, upon his acceptance to the United States Military Academy at West Point. As a future cadet, he will be joining the ranks of the world's most fearsome fighting force--the United States Army--guided by duty, honor, and country. The service and sacrifice of America's military personnel have safeguarded our Nation since its inception, defending our way of life from Lexington to Normandy. And throughout our history, American soldiers have demonstrated tremendous courage and strength, beating back tyranny to the ends of the earth. I was glad to sponsor Wyatt's nomination, and I am confident that his talents will distinguish him among his peers both during his time at West Point and thereafter. I congratulate Wyatt. I know that he will make this Nation proud."
"Madam Speaker, when we talk about having one economy instead of 13, from my perspective what we are talking about is something I think many Canadians have been hoping we would do for a really long time, which is to ensure that we have a very strong internal Canadian economy, that we have such a strong foundation and economy that we are able to withstand a lot of the uncertainty and unpredictability in the world. The more we eliminate interprovincial trade barriers, the more our small, medium and large businesses are able to expand and grow across our country to create high-paying jobs and to ensure that all our kids and grandkids have great-paying jobs both now and into the future."
"Mr. Chair, is it yes or no to the oil sands?"
Will the Minister give way?
I call the leader of the Liberal Democrats.
Will the hon. Lady give way?
"Madam Chair, Correctional Service Canada makes those determinations."
"I rise today to recognize the outstanding career and lasting contributions of a visionary educator and leader-- Dr. Craig Witherspoon. Over nearly four decades in public education, including ten transformative years as Superintendent of Richland County School District One in Columbia, South Carolina, Dr. Witherspoon has been a tireless champion for student achievement, equity, and innovation. His work has elevated not only the schools he served, but the communities they anchor. Dr. Witherspoon began his career as an instrumental music teacher and steadily rose through the ranks as a principal, instructional leader, and superintendent, with service in four states--Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, and South Carolina. He took the helm of Richland One in 2015, leading a diverse, urban-suburban-rural district serving more than 22,000 students and employing 4,000 educators and staff. Under his leadership, Richland One became a statewide and national model of innovation. The district launched South Carolina's first Virtual School Program for high school students, as well as the state's first high school commercial driver's license (CDL) training program and firefighter training program. It was also the first in the state to offer all 16 nationally recognized career clusters and establish a certified pre-apprenticeship program. His focus on early childhood education expanded pre-K access and launched the ``ThriveRichland'' initiative for school readiness. Dr. Witherspoon guided the district through the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, implementing a comprehensive reopening plan to ensure students could return safely to in-person instruction. Throughout his tenure, the district intensified family engagement, boosted graduation rates beyond the state average, and received system-wide accreditation with top-tier evaluation scores. He also prioritized summer learning through the district's Summer SOAR program and oversaw over $30 million in federal magnet school grants, as well as major investments in school facilities--from upgraded athletic stadiums to new academic wings focused on culinary arts, Montessori, and language immersion. Dr. Witherspoon's leadership was recognized with numerous awards, including 2024 Superintendent of the Year by the South Carolina Alliance of Black School Educators, 2022 Superintendent of the Year by the S.C. Athletic Administrators Association, and Administrator of the Year by several professional education associations. Under his guidance, the district and its schools received a remarkable list of accolades--from National Blue Ribbon recognition to national awards for health, energy conservation, and inclusive education. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in honoring the extraordinary service of Dr. Craig Witherspoon. His career exemplifies the power of education to transform lives and communities. He leaves behind a legacy of vision, integrity, and excellence that will continue to shape South Carolina's future for generations to come."
"Mr. Speaker, the legislation was introduced just this week, and constituents in the riding of Waterloo have already become very engaged, which speaks to its importance and the need for it. They also hear a lot of the commentary being shared in regard to the charter. What was exciting today, listening to the debate, was that the opposition, the Conservative Party, on two occasions now, has asked for a charter statement. I remember when our government started with charter statements. They labelled them in many different ways, but today are recognizing the need for us to protect our rights and freedoms, and with rights and freedoms come responsibilities. My question is one that a constituent in the riding of Waterloo asked, which is whether the secretary of state can just clearly and understandably explain what the legislation would do for Canadians and what it would not do for Canadians."
"I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. Implementing the armed forces covenant is something that this Government feel strongly about. That is why we are bringing forward legislation that will implement the armed forces covenant fully into law on a national basis, so that it grips not just on local authorities but on central Government. There is real merit in implementing the armed forces covenant at a local level. There are pockets of best practice nationwide--not just in military cities like Plymouth, which I represent, but across the country. It can also be of benefit to councils and communities, so I would encourage him to continue his campaign to ensure that the covenant is properly implemented. For too long we have heard stories of bad experiences that have gone unchallenged, some resulting in tragedy. The Defence Secretary has made it clear from his first day in the Department that there will be zero tolerance for this type of behaviour. That is why we are acting, and that is why I hope that the whole House will support this vital endeavour and the amendments to the Bill. I invite the House to agree to Lords amendments 1, 4, 5 and 6, which were made by the Government in response to suggestions made by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. They have the effect of fully implementing the Committee's recommendations to change the regulation-making power to define relevant family members contained in the Bill from the negative to the affirmative procedure."
"Mr. Chair, the program represents 25% of all construction in Canada. I am rather surprised that the minister cannot answer my questions. Is it an inflationary program, yes or no?"
"Mr. Chair, just to help the minister, according to Statistics Canada, we are at 41.7 million people right now. That is 200,000 more people than at the end of last year, and 500,000 more people than the minister's plan. What is the minister doing to make sure that she achieves her plan for this year?"
"The armed forces covenant trust fund is one of the mechanisms we use to support the charitable sector, but we must also step back and look holistically at the fact that there are 1,730 armed forces charities in the UK. Op Valour will help to synthesise that, get more bang for buck and ensure that veterans get the right support where and when they need it."
"Mr. Speaker, all parliamentarians have before us the main estimates and the supplementary (A)s that were provided in relation to what this government is planning on spending on defence. We as parliamentarians have an ability to look at the outlay of money here in this place to be able to make those decisions. The government has committed to a budget in the fall session. It is important. I did not get the chance to raise this directly in my speech, but whether the government is looking at defence partnerships in Europe, the continuation of the dynamic between Canada and U.S. administrations and how that shoe may fall, or the one Canadian economy legislation and whether we have supportive members in this House to be able to move forward, all of that is going to have an impact on what a financial analysis and a budget will actually look like, including measures of saving, where this government will be looking to find efficiency in government spending. All of that is coming in the fall, and my colleague will have the ability to look at it, as will we."
"I completely agree with the last point that my hon. Friend makes. Scrutiny of Government legislation through the proper processes in either this House or the other House--or through Select Committees, for that matter, which do it in a slightly different way--is one thing, and the business of developing policy is another. I completely apologise for the inadvertent sending of the email to the wrong address and all the rest of it. We are simply trying to engage as many Members in this House and the other House as we possibly can, on a matter that clearly matters to a great number of Members of Parliament because of their constituents. That includes my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Dame Meg Hillier), who I know has a very large creative community in her own constituency. We want to involve as many people as we possibly can. We may be moving faster on occasions than people want, but sometimes the demand is that we move faster. I apologise for the inadvertent discourtesy, but we are simply trying to engage as many people in the future debate as we possibly can."
"Mr. Speaker, I will not resign on that, but I will certainly withdraw that. It is all in good humour. Again, for people who are watching this on TV, obviously members go back and forth, and the rhetoric gets high, but there are also a lot of friends on both sides of the aisle here. I appreciate the good-hearted comment. Let us talk about some economic facts. I know the party opposite likes to talk about food inflation and how prices are high, and it is easy easy to cherry-pick 10 items. I know beef has been listed a lot. I used to work for a company called Canada Packers, which sold beef. Beef, historically, is always high at this time of year, for what that is worth. I think turkey prices have come down. I remember the former leader of the opposition talking about these multi-hundred-dollar turkeys. I bought a turkey at our grocery store here two weeks ago; it was $29. Let us talk economic facts. Inflation, two years ago, was at 8.7%, and oh my gosh, the whole way up, it was our fault. There was this little thing called COVID. There was inflation in basically every country around the world, but it was our fault. It was our government's fault that inflation was happening. In two years, we have brought that down from 8.1%, I believe, to 1.7%. It is below the Bank of Canada's target rate. Do we have a lot of work to do? Absolutely. Have prices come down like we want them to? No, they have not, but our economy is showing signs of life. We have a AAA Moody's credit rating. Workforce participation is 65.3%. In the U.S., it is 62.5%. There are a lot of good things happening in our economy. Real GDP just rose by 2.2% in the first quarter, surpassing expectations. Look, there is nobody on this side of the House, there is nobody in the House, who is not saying we have more work to do as a party, as a government, as MPs. Do we need to hold grocery stores more to account? Absolutely we do, but our economy is growing, and our economy is going to thrive again under the leadership of our Prime Minister . At door after door after door, people wanted our Prime Minister to lead this country. I think it goes without saying, with his economic background, his economic strength. They compared the two leaders. Straight up, they compared the two leaders, and they chose our Prime Minister. Sadly, the former leader of the opposition could not even hold his own riding. Our economy is going to continue to grow. Right now, our government's main laser focus is to deliver for Canadians. We have moved forward with the plan to bring down costs so Canadians can keep more of their paycheques to spend where it matters the most. What I am talking about is the middle-class tax cut, effective July 1. It is going to have an impact on 22 million Canadians, saving families up to $840 a year. We want Canadians to have more money to put back in their pockets. It was a great idea. I am glad the Conservatives have joined us in helping us move that legislation forward. This is because the majority of relief on this tax cut is going to go to Canadians with incomes in the lowest two tax brackets, which is to say those with taxable incomes under $114,750 in 2025. Within that group of hard-working Canadians, nearly half of the tax savings would go to those in the lowest tax bracket, which is to say those who earn $57,375 or less in 2025. We can deliver these tax savings to Canadians expeditiously because, with the announcement of our middle-class tax cut, the Canada Revenue Agency has updated its source deduction tables for the July to December 2025 period so that pay administrators are able to reduce tax withholdings as of July 1. That is a government of action. That is a government that is responding to Canadians' needs. Sometimes, when I listen to the members across, I would not think we had a throne speech just two weeks ago. I would not believe we were elected to government just on April 28. We want to make sure that our budget is accurate. We want to make sure that we take the time. There is absolutely no doubt that when we deliver our budget in the fall, it is going to be accurate, it is going to be serious and it is going to be delivered by one of the best finance ministers we have had, Minister Champagne ."
"Mr. Speaker, in his well-thought-out speech, my colleague talked about trust and how the government cannot seem to tell Canadians how many people would be affected and what the cost would be. This is from Immigration Canada's own website: Support for immigration among Canadians has decreased substantially. These are the government's own words. The number of Canadians who say we're bringing in too many newcomers is up 50% in two years. The government says it is the most concern about the rate of immigration that it has seen in 20 years. Does the member think the government making these changes in Bill C-3 without knowing how many people would be affected will add trust and confidence to the system?"
"No, I am going to carry on. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Lisa Smart) mentioned new clauses 87 and 88. This Government have been clear that water companies must accelerate action to reduce pollution to the environment. The Water (Special Measures) Act, which received Royal Assent earlier this year, significantly strengthens the power of the regulators and delivers on the Government's commitment to put failing water companies under special measures. Among other measures, the Act introduced automatic penalties on polluters and banned bonuses for water company executives if they fail to meet adequate standards."
"Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to participate in this evening's committee of the whole debate on the main estimates. Before I get into the topic at hand, I would like to take a moment to highlight some of the measures that are so important to the people of my constituency of Toronto—St. Paul's and that our new government is taking to build the strongest economy in the G7 and bring down the cost of living, measures I know the Minister of Finance in particular has been leading on. Since being elected two months ago, we are already focused on delivering a plan to address the cost of living challenges that have eroded Canadians' quality of life, change that puts more money in the pockets of Canadians, change that builds a more affordable Canada. The government is well aware of the affordability challenges that have long impacted low-income and vulnerable Canadians and are now having serious impacts on middle-class households. Rents have gone up, and home prices have gone up. A generation of young Canadians are questioning whether they can afford a place to live today and whether they will be able to own a home of their own tomorrow. That is why the government is taking immediate action to address this crisis, and key to that plan is bringing down costs so Canadians can keep more of their paycheques and spend where it matters most to them. The government will be eliminating the GST for first-time homebuyers on new homes at or under $1 million. This tax cut alone will save Canadians up to $50,000, allowing more young people and their families to enter the housing market and realize the dream of home ownership. By eliminating the GST, Canadians will face lower upfront housing costs and keep more money in their pockets. It will also have a dynamic effect on increasing supply, spurring the construction of new homes across the country. We are also delivering a middle-class tax cut that will provide relief for nearly 22 million Canadians and save families up to $840. Canadians will start seeing these tax savings on their paycheques as of July 1, when the rate is adjusted. We are now formalizing the cancellation of the consumer carbon price, which took effect on April 1. With these measures, together we are delivering change that will affect people in their day-to-day lives, cut taxes, bring down costs and, most importantly, put money back in the pockets of Canadians. Turning to the main estimates and some of the spending measures we have laid out, a major element of Finance Canada's portion focuses on Canada's universal public health care system, something that is so important to Canadians. I am proud of Canada's universal health care system and the workers who uphold it, but they are under enormous strain, and it has been a challenge for Canadians to receive the high-quality care they expect. Patients seeking emergency care have found emergency rooms overwhelmed. Surgeries have been postponed or cancelled. In the past, the government delivered urgent, much-needed investment to strengthen our public health care system. In budget 2023, the government delivered a plan to provide an additional $198.3 billion over 10 years."
"Mr. Chair, I am sure the member already has the answer to the question being asked, or he would not be asking it."
"Mr. Speaker, everyone in the House agrees on one important fact: This is a critical time for Canada, as we face tariff threats from the United States. At this critical time, all members of the House must work together to build one Canadian economy, to create the strongest economy in the G7. We need free trade in Canada. We must build major projects."
"I will speak to the amendments relating to compulsory purchase powers, and to my new clause 128. I note that much of the Bill and most of the clauses will not affect Scotland, but, unusually for a planning Bill, there are components that do affect it. Before I talk about the detail of my concerns about compulsory purchase powers, I want to set out a little of the context, and say why the issue is exercising so many of my constituents. I am privileged to represent the Scottish Borders--the place I call home. It is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful parts of the United Kingdom, but it is under attack. The net-zero-at-all-costs agenda of this UK Labour Government, backed by the SNP in Edinburgh, is causing huge concern to my constituents. Massive pylons, solar farms, wind farms and battery storage units are ruining the Scottish Borders as we know them, and compulsory purchase powers are a key part of delivering many of those projects."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank the parliamentary secretary, with whom I enjoy a good relationship. This legislation is an abomination, and one that will be a stain on the the reputation of the government and our Prime Minister . As a first effort to lead this country, it is a bad effort, and I am very sad to say that this legislation could have been improved if it had been studied at all, if the voices that had been silenced had been heard."
"I think I am pushing it. I tried to intervene on the hon. Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater) to ask what she thinks about that. She is welcome to intervene on me now if she has further points to add. Otherwise, I ask the Minister to address those points."
"—by ultimately, to use one of the words the member is saying, enhancing our border security to make it even stronger. That is what Bill C-2 does. It addresses an issue that was an irritant, if I can put it that way, to Donald Trump. A number of measures were put into place. Under the new Prime Minister and the new administration, we have seen a tangible investment of $1.3 billion, a commitment of 1,000 new CBSA personnel and 1,000 additional RCMP officers. This is a tangible commitment from a budgetary measure, and it will make a difference. It addresses many concerns, providing the types of supports that are necessary, the physical supports of personnel. Extend that to what we have today: substantial legislation to complement the budgetary allotment of $1.3 billion as an investment in providing safe and secure borders. When I say we have to take a look at it from a bigger picture, it is all part of addressing concerns that Stephen Harper failed to deal with completely when Pierre Poilievre was around the cabinet table and the Conservative caucus, and improving upon the previous administration of Justin Trudeau. What we have now before us through this legislation is yet another aspect of building a stronger and healthier country. The Prime Minister often talks about having the strongest country economically in the G7. This is part of that. One just needs to take a look at the highly successful G7 conference we just had, which I believe the Prime Minister handled exceptionally well. At the end of the day, we were able to talk about some of the measures that we have taken to address some of the shortcomings from the past. Support for our borders is one of them, and the military investment is another one. For how many years were we being challenged to provide military support? All of this is important because when we are sitting at the table, it is from the point of view of strength. We can say that we have beefed up our borders by investing $1.3 billion, introduced substantial legislation and met the United Nations's 2% GDP requirement. Issues have been raised in the past that reflect what Canada has: our natural resources and commodities and the people of Canada. We are coming from a very strong background going to the table. That is why I believe Bill C-2 is very important. It is not just about national security. It builds upon the bigger picture of having a stronger, healthier economy in general. We can take a look at some of the specifics. I made reference to the fact that the National Police Association supports the legislation, and there is a very good reason it is doing that. It is because these actions demonstrate to our local, domestic and international partners that we take our borders seriously and want to start dealing in a more tangible way with things such as fentanyl, auto theft, human trafficking, irregular migration and transnational organized crime. These are very important issues. We have an administration that is very focused on and putting a great deal of energy into dealing with those issues. I look forward to this legislation passing and going to committee. I know there are people who have concerns. At the end of the day, some of that concern comes from, I would suggest, misinformation from the Conservative Party. The best example I could give of that is something that was referenced when the bill was first brought in. I was listening to comments by members of the Conservative Party, who were saying that this legislation would allow the police and letter carriers to open up people's mail, to open any letter they want to. Most Canadians would be very surprised to find out that law enforcement agencies do not have the authority to even get a warrant to open a letter in transit. For the very first time, through this legislation, a law enforcement officer, through a general warrant that has been justified, would be able to open a letter, when it is warranted. I do not see that as an invasion of privacy, because it has to go through checks and balances and a process to protect the individual's privacy, yet it would make a substantial difference. Imagine if anyone could put fentanyl into an envelope and mail it anywhere in the country. Under the current system, the police or a law enforcement officer could do nothing about it. Once it arrives, yes, they could, but not while it is in transit between destinations. I think most Canadians would be very surprised to hear that. Contrary to the misinformation we witnessed the other day when the Conservatives were talking about the legislation, it is not a free-for-all. Letters are still going to be confidential. It would not be a violation of privacy, but we need to protect people. There are communities in Canada that are very concerned about mail going to their communities, the illegal things that are put into envelopes. It is a legitimate concern. We hear a lot about extortion. Last Saturday evening, I was sitting in a house on Sanderson Avenue and individuals were sharing with me stories of serious extortion. That has been raised in the House. Again, this legislation would enable additional tools for law enforcement agencies to do more in combatting extortion, child abuse or child pornography. It would allow more work to be done on the money-laundering file and other types of illegal money transactions. The legislation would allow for more communications with immigration and refugees. It would enable provinces, territories and Ottawa to do more in terms of sharing information. Canada, thinking internationally, is one of the Five Eyes countries, which allows us to share more information through different agencies. I see this as a very healthy positive. For the individuals who really want to see a stronger and healthier border where Canadians will be protected more and where we can protect the integrity of our immigration system even more, dealing with asylum and things of that nature, this is good legislation. I look forward to the Conservatives recognizing that and allowing the legislation to go to committee at some point."
"I stand here today in support of labor leader David Huerta. The head of the SEIU California union was arrested in Los Angeles while exercising his First Amendment rights to speech and assembly, rights that are guaranteed to all of us in the Constitution. That is what separates us from autocratic regimes around the world. The Trump administration is now going after judges, Members of Congress, political opponents, students, law firms, reporters, Governors, and now the leader of a powerful labor union. This is about abusing power to silence dissent. This is about generating fear to turn us against each other so that we don't pay attention to this lawbreaking administration. David Huerta said this after being arrested: ``What happened to me is not about me. This is about something much bigger. This is about how we as a community stand together and resist the injustice that is happening. Hardworking people and members of our family and community are being treated like criminals. We all collectively have to object to this madness because this is not justice.''"
"I thank the hon. Member for raising this issue. She is right: it is unacceptable that women can wait up to 10 years for an endometriosis diagnosis. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's updated guidelines on endometriosis make firmer recommendations on referral and investigations, which will help women receive a diagnosis and effective treatment faster. It is important that we continue to work as closely we can on this issue across the whole UK."
"My party was pleased to hear the announcement that GB Energy is coming to Aberdeen, which we have consistently said is the only sensible place for it, as Members would expect an Aberdeen MP to say. Given that GB Energy will bring a maximum of 1,000 jobs over the next 10 years, will the right hon. Gentleman please encourage his ministerial colleagues not to suggest that those jobs will replace the 400 jobs a fortnight that we are set to lose in the offshore energy industry over the next five years?"
"Mr. Chair, the northern road link that has been proposed by Marten Falls First Nation and Webequie First Nation has been under assessment for two years. As I mentioned, during the lost Liberal decade projects have been stalled through the impact assessment process. On what date will the northern road link project be approved?"
"I do not want to eat the Secretary of State's sandwiches, and I am acutely aware that the statement that he is about to make--"
"The Leader of the House will be aware that Queen's hospital in Romford, which serves the boroughs of Havering, Barking and  Dagenham and of Redbridge, is in urgent need of an A&E upgrade. Indeed, I met the Minister for Secondary Care only this week to discuss it. May we have an urgent statement from the Government on this issue? The situation has led to many patients being left on trolleys for more than 24 hours. The hospital serves 800,000 people in that radius, and that is simply not acceptable. Please can some of the money from the statement yesterday be spent in Romford on a hospital that serves local people?"
I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.
"I welcome the Minister's announcement and the change in course from the Government. Many of us were uneasy about the low threshold for the winter fuel payment, especially in deprived communities such as mine--I have the most deprived borough in the country. Will the Minister assure my constituents that all pensioners under the threshold will automatically receive the new winter fuel allowance and will not have to do a single thing in the winter to come?"
"Further education has had a difficult time over the past few years and we are starting to see the kind of investment that will make a difference. We need more business input into skills' policy, which I think is the kind of work that my hon. Friend was talking about. I am more than happy to come up the road from Stalybridge to Rochdale one Friday, and we can have that conversation in person. There will be many bids from Greater Manchester for the capital that we are putting forward, and I look forward to looking at the bid that he mentions."
We are not going to debate this. The hon. parliamentary secretary.
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 137 designates the House Press Gallery as the Frederick Douglass Press Gallery. Frederick Douglass came to Washington, D.C., in 1870 to become editor of the New National Era paper, which chronicled the progress of African Americans in the United States. He became the first African-American member of the press gallery from 1871 to 1875. In 2007, he was honored with a plaque and painting in the House Press Gallery. This resolution today will officially name the House Press Gallery after him. I thank the gentleman from Florida, Representative Donalds, for his leadership on this bipartisan resolution. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the legislation and reserve balance of my time."
"Mr. Speaker, I think that the measures being put forward by our government, such as the tax cut, the GST rebate on new homes and the other initiatives that have been mentioned, will give the people of Les Pays‑d'en‑Haut a bit of break when it comes to affordability. I think these flagship measures from our government will pay off."
"Mr. Speaker, I will repeat my question. How does the minister think a pipeline can protect the environment?"
"This Government's plan to support women is clear and ambitious. The aim is to reduce the number of women going to prison. Our Women's Justice Board will support that. The independent sentencing review's recommendations--[Interruption.] I am on the wrong question; apologies. [Interruption.] Well, you got a preview of the next answer, Mr Speaker. We are committed to ensuring that offenders leave prison with the jobs and skills needed to lead law-abiding lives. That is why we have launched regional employment councils, which for the first time bring businesses together with prisons, probation and the Department for Work and Pensions to support offenders in the community."
"All those opposed to the hon. member's moving the motion will please say nay. Hearing none, it is agreed. The House has heard the terms of the motion. All those opposed to the motion will please say nay. (Motion agreed to)"
"It is vital that scandals like this are never again covered up because of the racial background of perpetrators. Baroness Casey's report said, to use her words, that people who downplay the ethnic dimension are letting victims down, so I have to raise the matter of the language that the Prime Minister used in January, when I am afraid to say he smeared campaigners as jumping on a ""far-right bandwagon"" simply for calling for the very inquiry that he has now been forced to set up. Standing up for rape victims is not far-right. Will the Deputy Prime Minister apologise for what the Prime Minister said?"
"Questions and comments, the hon. member for Mirabel."
"Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking the Liberals and the Conservatives, who have so eloquently demonstrated, through Bill C-5 , why Quebec needs to become its own country, even though even though we already had plenty of arguments to support that. We are witnessing another blatant multi-party attempt at nation-building and using crises to further centralize power, which is second nature to Ottawa, as we have always seen throughout the course of history. In the past, it was railways that were used as a sign of national unity, and today it is pipelines. Do the Conservatives plan to sue the Liberals for plagiarism?"
"I declare an interest as a sitting councillor. Local government will be pleased to see an increase in spending and to have clarity but, alongside social care, we have no clarity on another area that will sink councils: the statutory override on special educational needs. That was promised time and again, and we were hanging our hats on having it today. Will the Chancellor tell us what is happening and can we give security to councils on special educational needs?"
"Mr. Speaker, my home province will be listening very closely to the conversation that we are having tonight. The National Energy Board, in its decision on Energy East, said that the NEB “will consider...upstream and downstream GHG emissions” in determining whether these projects are “in the public interest.” This is effectively the government policy right now. According to the Canada Energy Regulator, the former National Energy Board, in 2023, Canada imported 19.5 billion dollars' worth of crude oil. This included 2.5 billion dollars' worth of oil imported into Canada from Nigeria, and 2.1 billion dollars' worth from Saudi Arabia. Is the $2.5 billion of oil imported into Canada from Nigeria and the $2.1 billion from Saudi Arabia subject to the same rigorous reporting on upstream and downstream emissions as oil coming from Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador?"
"I cannot comment on hypotheticals, but I can assure my hon. Friend that we will do all we can to protect our assets and our troops in the region and always to stay within international law."
"Recent research by the Centre for Social Justice showed that at key stage 1, key stage 2, GCSEs, A-levels and T-levels, boys are underperforming girls. We simply cannot allow half a generation not to be allowed to reach their full potential. As part of her approach, will the Secretary of State consider looking at whether boys might need to be taught somewhat differently from girls?"
"We are absolutely on the record with the 66.7% target. I want to take this opportunity to set out what appears to be a philosophical difference between this Government's approach to our health and care system and that of many Opposition Members. We believe in  devolution, we believe in decentralisation, and we believe in empowering those who are closest to the citizen to make the decisions that need to be made. If others have a more centralising and deeply anachronistic approach to managing our health and care system, which I heard from Liberal Democrat and Conservative Members, that is up to them, but we believe in modernising our system, not micromanaging or having shopping lists of targets. It is about providing support and agreeing on outcomes, but leaving those who are best placed at the coalface to decide how best to meet the unmet needs of their communities. That is a very clear dividing line between us. On research, it is worth pointing out that we have done studies with UK Research and Innovation, the Alzheimer's Society and the People's Postcode Lottery. We have found that through our investment, ADAPT and READ-OUT are working to produce clinical and economic data that could bring blood tests to the NHS within five years to support the diagnosis of dementia. All of this means that the rate of diagnosis is improving. The latest data from April shows that the diagnosis rate has inched up to 65.5%, up 0.3% since July 2024, and it is worth noting that the 66.7% ambition has not been met since 2020. The quality and availability of care services is variable, as Members have pointed out. We are empowering local leaders with the autonomy they need. We are supporting integrated care boards. I am pleased to say that we recently published the Dementia 100 pathway assessment tool, which brings together multiple resources into a single, consolidated training tool. That launched last month, and there has been huge interest and support from the sector, with 1,000 people registering to attend the launch webinar. We have the dementia care pathway full implementation guidance, and we are supporting the implementation of that guidance through a dashboard, to enable targeted support where it is needed. All those who have dementia deserve to receive high-quality care. We must have a workforce that is equipped with the skills that are needed. We are incredibly proud of everyone who works in the care sector, and they deserve the training that many Members have mentioned. The care workforce pathway provides guidance for progression and development for professionals across adult social care with the knowledge, skills, values and behaviours that our carers need. It links learning outcomes to existing frameworks, including the dementia training standards framework. Some of those learning outcomes can be achieved through the training and qualifications eligible for funding under the learning and development support scheme. That scheme, launched in September last year, supports adult social care employers to invest in their workforce through funded training opportunities, including a range of dementia-related qualifications. I am pleased to confirm that we have backed the scheme with a PS12 million investment. Pay and conditions are also vital elements of our workforce strategy, so I am sure Members across the House will welcome our groundbreaking fair pay agreement legislation in the Employment Rights Bill for adult social care workers, which is hugely significant in this context. On the question of our care workforce, a number of Members have highlighted the vital role that unpaid carers play. To support them, on 7 April the Government  increased the carer's allowance weekly earnings limit from PS151 a week to PS196 a week, which is the equivalent of 16 hours at the national living wage--the largest increase in the earnings limit since the carer's allowance was introduced in 1976. We are very proud of that change. I understand that every person with dementia, alongside their friends, families and carers, has their own unique and important story of living with dementia. I know that I am not alone in this fight. I want to pay tribute to the Alzheimer's Society, Dementia UK and Alzheimer's Research UK for all their vital work. Together, we will build a society where every person with dementia receives high-quality care from diagnosis through to the end of life. I once again thank the hon. Member for South Devon for raising this vital topic."
"Parliamentarians, I would like to take this opportunity to remind everyone of an anniversary that is of great importance to our parliamentary family. June 23 will mark the 10th anniversary of the official creation of the Parliamentary Protective Service. Throughout the 10 years of its existence, the Parliamentary Protective Service has anticipated and adapted to emerging and growing threats, while always remaining true to its values of respect, professionalism. integrity, accountability and leadership. The PPS values are the ones that keep us safe, and for that we are most grateful. For the last 10 years, day after day, these women and men in uniform have been keeping parliamentarians and Parliament safe, and by extension, keeping Canada's democracy strong. With smiles and hellos, they help us start and end each day. Of course, the Parliament of Canada is more than a workplace; it is the seat of Canadian democracy and attracts visitors from around the world. Our colleagues in uniform welcome these visitors with Canada's trademark civility and courtesy. While the House of Commons is a workplace for parliamentarians and employees, it is also a sacred space for democracy, belonging to every Canadian. As we all know, protecting democracy is no easy task. Let me now draw to the attention of members the presence in the gallery of many members of the Parliamentary Protective Service. I am thankful for their long service, their bravery, their achievement and their commitment to PPS."
"I rise today in honor of national Women Veterans Day. Last week, I spoke with a combat veteran from Kaneohe, Hawaii, my hometown. She was among the first class of women to graduate from West Point. Two decades after leaving the Army, she returned to serve as a chaplain. She deployed to Afghanistan, earned Airborne and Air Assault qualification, and was awarded the Legion of Merit and five Meritorious Service Medals. Yet she felt compelled to come all the way to Washington, D.C., to join in a veterans protest on D-day because the very progress she helped to secure she now saw being callously unraveled. These include women's history erased from Defense websites; senior female leaders pushed out; accountability on sexual assault fading; and a narrow, male-centric culture of lethality that sidelines women in service. She asked me: How is it we are fighting and having to refight the battles we have already won? Shame on this administration for turning its back on women like my constituent who have worn the uniform and are now made to fight again for the dignity and respect they have already earned. Women veterans are watching, and they will not be silent."
"more than 16 million people are going to lose their healthcare, and tens of millions of Americans are going to pay more for healthcare every month. Hundreds of rural hospitals are going to be forced to close, and we are going to plunge thecountry into trillions of dollars of new debt. Now, what is this all for? Is it to improve our schools and roads? Is it to make housing and childcare more affordable? Is it because we are in the middle of a crisis that just has to be paid for or we are going to pay down the national debt? No. It is none of those things. It is because they want to cut taxes for the richest people to ever exist. And if that means you can't see your doctor or you have to pay hundreds of dollars more every month to pay for your healthcare, tough luck. Now, here is the thing: Republicans actually know what they are walking into because people in their own States are telling them what is about to happen. ``We can't sustain serving our community the way we are with these cuts,'' one hospital leader in Kansas said. A health executive in Texas wrote:  Cutting billions of dollars from [Medicaid] would have widespread and devastating consequences for Texans. Beyond the obvious impacts to people enrolled in the program, the collateral damage of program cuts will be felt across the board. Hospitals will do everything they can to weather the storm, but some may not survive. Others will have to increase their reliance on state or local support or reduce services. Access to care will decrease, especially for high-cost service lines like maternal [health] care and behavioral health. Jobs will be lost. The impact on communities--which rely on their hospitals for employment and growth--will be profound.  A Utah father who credited Medicaid with saving his own son's life said:  Without Medicaid, these life-saving treatments would have been financially impossible. There is absolutely no way we would have covered the cost on our own. . . . And in this way, our story is not unique. So many families insured by Medicaid could have to make difficult, life-altering decisions if Congress slashes funding.  A former Republican elected official in Georgia warned:  Cuts to Medicaid are not only fiscally irresponsible, but they could threaten the livelihoods of our fellow Georgians and the economic opportunities that consistently make our great state a top state for business.  So the stakes are clear: It is people's health. It is people's hard- earned money. It is people's lives. And whether you are in a red or a blue State, you will absolutely feel the weight of this terrible piece of legislation. More than a quarter of nursing homes may close. Hundreds of rural hospitals will shutter. And for what? To pay down the debt because we are a nation at war, because we want to invest in infrastructure or schools or healthcare? No. The reason they are making these cuts to food assistance, the reason they are making these cuts to rural hospitals, the reason they are making these cuts so that people are going to have to pay several hundred dollars more per month for their own healthcare is to create enough revenue for the biggest tax cut, the biggest wealth transfer from working people to wealthy people in the history of the United States of America. Even if you are not on Medicaid yourself, you likely know someone who is--a friend, a neighbor, a relative, a coworker. And, more than that, kicking tons of people in your community off of healthcare will drive up costs for everybody else and make high-quality care hard to find. You are going to pay more for less care--all for the biggest tax cut in American history for the people who need it the least. I have no problem with the people who need it the least. But the truth is, they need it the least. If you are financially successful and you make $4 million a year, God bless. That is the American dream. It does not mean you need a tax cut, and it does not mean you need a tax cut paid for by reducing services, especially in rural communities. The good news is this: We actually don't have to do this. There is no rush to do this. There is no clamoring among constituents in red or blue States to do this. This is an add-on. What they want to do is extend the original tax cuts. I opposed those tax cuts, but I can understand that Republicans, as an article of faith, want to extend the tax cuts that their President enacted two terms ago--fair enough--good, solid, old-fashioned policy disagreements. But then they just larded it up with stuff--giveaways to special interests, and cuts and cuts and cuts to things that people care about--left, right, and center. We don't actually have to do it this way. You are going to pay more for less care, all so that billionaires have a little more money sitting in their accounts. It is going to require four Republicans saying: Enough is enough. I have heard a number of my Republican colleagues talk about how essential Medicaid is to their rural communities. And it is not just the people who are on Medicaid. Obviously, those are the people you have to be primarily concerned with. But a lot of us go home and visit both urban and rural hospitals, and they all say the same thing, which is that, if you blow out 30 percent of your revenue, you can't function as an institution. So it is not just a question of whether you personally are on Medicaid or you personally care about Medicaid. It is about: Does your rural hospital even survive after this bill is enacted? Nobody wants this, and there is still time to kill this bill. I yield the floor."
Order. I call the Chair of the Education Committee.
"today I did not vote on Roll Call Nos. 148 and 149, as I was meeting with constituents. Had I been present, I would have voted NO on Roll Call No. 148, Ordering the previous question of H. Res. 458, and NO on Roll Call No. 149, Providing for consideration of H.R. 2483, SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act of 2025; H.R. 2931, Save SBA from Sanctuary Cities Act of 2025; H.R. 2966, American Entrepreneurs First Act of 2025; and H.R. 2987, CEASE Act of 2025."
"I, unfortunately, had other engagements that had been scheduled. The resolution was introduced to, again, focus a component of the dialogue. Of course, our thoughts and our condolences go out, but we need more than thoughts and condolences. We need to have the conversation about how to prevent this from happening again. We need to have the public safety dialogue. That is what the resolution does."
"Mr. Chair, I am familiar with instances, yes."
"Madam Speaker, in his speech, my colleague mentioned that he was concerned about our government's lack of clear direction. However, as a new member, I can say that the direction has been very clear since the election campaign. Our platform is crystal clear. The first subsection of the platform, entitled “One Canadian Economy”, talks about a plan to build the strongest economy in the G7, to create one Canadian economy, not 13, and to remove all barriers to internal trade. The second subsection talks about nation-building projects. What is surprising about this? The direction we were going to take was written in black and white in our platform."
"Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 34(1), I have the true honour to present to the House, in both official languages, the following reports: the report of the Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association respecting its participation at the joint meeting of the Defence and Security Committee, the Economics and Security Committee and the Political Committee in Brussels, Belgium, from February 19 to 21, 2024; and the report of the Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association respecting its participation at the joint visit of the Sub-Committee on Transatlantic Relations and the Sub-Committee on Transatlantic Economic Relations in New York, New York, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America, from April 22 to 26, 2024."
Shocking.
"with admiration and appreciation, I wish to recognize the 100th anniversary of the Rhode Island State Police. For a century, these tireless men and women in uniform have traveled the highways and byways of our state to ensure the safety of our communities. They have lived up to their creed of honor, integrity, fairness, excellence, courage, honesty, and devotion to duty. On April 2, 1925 the Rhode Island General Assembly created the ``Rhode Island Department of State Police.'' It was the first such organization in our state dedicated to ensuring safety, order, and security for Rhode Islanders. What began with just 21 officers patrolling on Indian-brand motorcycles has grown into a modern, technologically advanced law enforcement agency committed to the highest standards of public service. From the earliest days of policing rural roads to the current use of cutting-edge technology, the agency has continually evolved to meet the challenges of each era while striving to maintain the trust and respect of the public it serves. Even their uniforms made an impression--most notably in 1986, when their distinctive attire earned national recognition and was featured on the David Letterman Show. Over the course of the agency's esteemed 100 year history, the dedicated men and women of the Rhode Island State Police have worked tirelessly to ensure Rhode Islanders' safety. And I know that for the next one hundred years they will continue to serve justice, help stranded motorists, and keep our communities safe. As they mark their centenary during national law enforcement week, I join every Rhode Islander in thanking the Troopers of the Rhode Island State Police for their 100 years of public service."
"I have witnessed starvation up close. Many years ago, I was visiting Mother Teresa's Home for the Dying in Calcutta. The room had a series of cots,filled with men. There was a men's side and a women's side, and I was on the men's side. Many of the men, the priest told me, had come after they had reached a point of malnutrition on the streets to which they had then collapsed. I was asked to tend to one young man, and his eyes were very bright, and I asked the priest: It appears like he is really focused. He said: No, no, no. This young man has been starving to death. His body has started to damage its own organs, and there is no recovery. All we can do is minister to his comfort. That involved taking sections of grapefruit and wiping them across his lips. I also visited a refugee center in Juba, in South Sudan, where the children's level of malnutrition was measured by an armband. It is one way of getting a quick sense of how little food they have had. It is called a mid-upper arm circumference. It is color coded, green to yellow to red, so aid workers can quickly see the severity of the malnutrition--the extent, if you will, of the impact of starvation. And I visited refugee camps in Somalia and in Kenya and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where families were fleeing conflict and, quite frankly, fleeing starvation. Starvation is sometimes the result of the chaos of war, sometimes the result of natural disasters, sometimes agricultural disasters. But what we are seeing now in the Middle East is a different form of disaster. It is a failure of political will to provide food. There is starvation in Gaza today because the Netanyahu government, which controls the amount of food flowing in, has chosen to use access to food as a weapon of war. I have come to the floor tonight to say that this is immoral, that this use of food as a weapon of war is wrong under any structure of religion or moral code. I have come to the floor to say that it violates human rights and to say that it violates international law, and that all of us should join together and call for our government-- the U.S. Government--to use every leverage of influence we have with our close ally Israel to have the Netanyahu government end this strategy. Over the last few months, public attention has turned away from the ongoing war in Gaza because there is so much else going on here in the United States and so much else going on around the world. Our newspapers and news feeds are full of stories about the Trump administration, about new tariffs, new Executive orders, new events across the country, and, also, quite frankly, about heartbreaking events of anti-Semitic violence against our American Jewish community. Before I turn to deliberate further on the horrific use of food as a weapon of war, I want to really note the importance of never allowing criticism of the practices of another government or, certainly, criticism of the Government of Israel--the Netanyahu government--to blur into discrimination or persecution of anyone based on their faith identity. I abhor discrimination, abhor persecution. I abhor anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitic acts, including assault and harassment and vandalism, have increased dramatically here in the United States. Across the country, in 2024 and on into 2025, the highest level has been recorded since the Anti-Defamation League started tracking the data in 1979. On the first night of Passover, an arsonist set fire to the Pennsylvania Governor's mansion, while the Governor, Josh Shapiro, and his family were asleep inside. Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky, who met working at the Israeli Embassy, were murdered here in Washington, DC, outside the Jewish Museum. And 12 people marching in support of the release of the hostages being held in Gaza were attacked and injured in Boulder, CO, just a week ago Sunday. I condemn these acts of anti-Semitism and violence. We must root out prejudice and discrimination. We must root it out of our hearts. We must root it out of the public acts. We must stand arm in arm with our Jewish community members whenever they are threatened. With that emphasis, let me be clear. As we stand arm in arm with our fellow Jewish citizens who are threatened by assault and harassment and vandalism and discrimination, we should also be standing arm in arm together against the use of the denial of food as a weapon of war, including by the Netanyahu government using that strategy in Gaza. We need an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, and I hope and pray every day that we will have such a cease-fire, and with that cease-fire will come the swift and safe return of all the remaining hostages. We also need an immediate massive influx of humanitarian aid, including water and medicine and, certainly, food. But under the relevant rules of international humanitarian law, the provision of food can never be tied to some other act like a cease- fire. Every nation has the responsibility in conflict to make sure they are not denying food in kind of a mass punishment of the other side. And, therefore, food should not be contingent upon the cease-fire. It needs to be provided under moral code, under religious code, under humanitarian law, under international law--cease-fire or no cease-fire. I have spoken previously about my concerns for the indiscriminate bombing that has killed tens of thousands of innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza, including women and children and the elderly. Those individuals are victims, as well, of the Netanyahu government's use of food as a weapon of war. I oppose and condemn this strategy, and I oppose and condemn the failure of the United States to use our resources and our influence to strive in every way possible to persuade the Netanyahu government to abandon the strategy of starvation. Following the horrific attacks of October 7, 2023, Israel had every right to go after Hamas. But how you do so does matter, and starving the civilian population of Gaza is morally reprehensible. Yet that is the strategy the Netanyahu government has employed, with only a periodic exemption, since the start of the war. Two days after the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas, then-Israeli Defense Minister Gallant laid out this strategy, saying:  I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed.  From the start of the war through the first 15 months, until the cease-fire of January 2025, the United Nations and international humanitarian organizations have warned of the growing crisis over food in Gaza.  Before the war began, an average of 500 trucks entered Gaza each day to provide the basic food needed to feed 2.1 million people. That food was supplemented by food that people in Gaza were growing. When Senator Van Hollen and I visited the Rafah gate crossing, in January of 2024, an average of only 150 trucks per day were getting into Gaza to provide medicine, equipment, and food. While we were at that gate, a doctor came out. He had just left through the Rafah gate crossing, after treating patients for about--I believe he told me--3 weeks at the European hospital. So this was, essentially, 3 months into the Gaza war. He said: We are already seeing major changes in patients' ability to recover because, he said, they are not getting enough nutrition. If you don't have enough food, your body doesn't have the energy to recover from a wound. This was just months into that war. For the following year, the number of trucks entering Gaza fell even lower, to an average of 100 trucks a day, just a fraction of the amount of food needed to provide civilians with sufficient nutrition. And the ability to grow food in Gaza essentially evaporated under the bombardment and the conditions of war. Then there was a moment of hope that this atrocity was ending, the discussion of the possibility of a lengthy cease-fire. But even as those discussions progressed, the information was flowing about, already, of the devastating effects of malnutrition. The Netanyahu government's strategy of food depravation had inflicted massive malnutrition and health problems on the 2 million Palestinians in Gaza. Malnutrition is devastating on the body. Malnutrition prevents the body from recovering from bombing-induced injuries. Malnutrition increases therisk of miscarriage. Malnutrition prevents mothers from being able to breastfeed their babies because their milk dries up. Malnutrition creates the possibility that babies will die because mothers who do not have breast milk may not be able to get clean water or formula, both being necessary for a baby to survive. Adults, as well as babies and children, suffer from the collateral effects of bodies weakened from malnutrition. And for those who do survive, the long-term health injuries are vast. Children who endure long-term hunger and malnutrition will have lifelong health damage, including stunted growth and impaired cognitive development. But then we had that break. Finally, after 15 months--January 2025-- the parties agreed to a cease-fire, including the return of 33 hostages and a surge in humanitarian aid, including food. During that cease- fire, 600 trucks a day on average entered Gaza with food and supplies. This delivery showed that it is entirely possible to efficiently get trucks into Gaza. When Senator Van Hollen and I were at the Rafah gate in January of the previous year, 2024, we witnessed a miles-long backup of trucks parked along the road to Rafah gate. We kept hearing from the Israeli Government: We just can't process these trucks and get them into Gaza. And they blamed the international organizations for the challenge. But it is clear: Once the Netanyahu government made a decision to get the trucks in, they could get them in. We saw it during the cease-fire. We knew it was possible all along. We knew it was an issue of political decision making to keep those trucks out, to inflict this hunger, to inflict this starvation on the population of Palestinians. But that food that came in, those 600 trucks, for that limited time period--a time period of 58 days--wasn't sufficient to make up for the malnutrition of the previous 15 months. It didn't erase the ravages that had been inflicted on the population. It certainly meant that enough food was getting in for kind of a daily consumption at that point, but it certainly wasn't long enough and didn't reverse the impacts of those first 15 months. And then, the interlude ended. On March 2, the cease-fire ended, and the Netanyahu government resumed using food as a weapon of war, blockading all humanitarian aid, including food and water and medicine, from reaching civilians in Gaza. The Netanyahu government's claims that not enough aid was delivered during the cease-fire to compensate for the blockade to come simply was false. Repeated public reports from the United Nations, from credible news sources, and from international humanitarian aid organizations all raised the alarm, month after month, that widespread hunger, malnutrition, and starvation had been growing as aid supplies ran out. One way to determine if there is a shortage is to look at food prices. When there is no shortage in food, prices are stable. There is a tool that governments use and nongovernmental organizations use called the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification System--fancy words for a tool to evaluate prices and how they reflect shortages. That tool provides reports from that, and it reported that a 55-pound sack of flour, which sold for $17 in Gaza in February 2025, in May 2025, after the blockade was reimposed, sold for $520--not $17 but $520. Here at home in the United States, restaurant all-purpose flour can be found on the internet for $18.69, a 50-pound sack, with free home delivery. In other words, the shortage of food resulted in flour being about 27 times more expensive than it had been previously in Gaza a few months before and about 27 times more expensive than what a pound of flour costs here in the United States of America. Those staggering prices tell you several things: first, that the humanitarian feeding operations, after the blockade was reimposed, were absolutely unable to meet the need for food. People who have their food needs met don't pay that type of price--$520--for a sack of flour. Second, it means that food was a luxury that only the affluent in Gaza could afford, the few who had the ability to get funds from outside of Gaza; and finally, that folks who did not have that money weren't going to be able to buy flour to cook anything. Then, on March 25, just 3 weeks into the blockade, the World Food Programme reported that due to the Netanyahu government's blockade, all 25 of their bakeries had run out of flour and fuel. So realize: March 2, the reimposition of the blockade, and within a couple weeks, by March 25, the bakeries under the World Food Programme had run out of flour and fuel. According to the New York Times, those bakeries had produced ``enough bread to supply about 70 percent of Gaza's population,'' but those bakeries were shut down weeks after the blockade was reimposed. The IPC also reports that Gaza's 177 hot-meal kitchens, run by various aid organizations, exhausted their supplies at the beginning of April, 1 month into the reimposition of the blockade. One of these aid organizations was World Central Kitchen. World Central Kitchen is known around the world for stepping into situations and helping out where there are humanitarian disasters of all kinds and in this case, the disaster of the restriction of food by the Netanyahu government. World Central Kitchen's emergency meal services provide an estimated 400,000 to 500,000 meals per day, but on May 7, World Central Kitchen announced:  After serving more than 130 million total meals and 26 million loaves of bread over the past 18 months, World Central Kitchen no longer has the supplies to cook meals or bake bread in Gaza.  Within weeks of the blockade being reestablished, the markets were empty, the bakeries were shut down, and hot-meal kitchens were closed. The effect on the people in Gaza, the Palestinians of Gaza, the 2.1 million Palestinians living there: devastating. Palestinian civilians had been suffering from malnutrition from early on--as the doctor told me, 3 months after the war had begun--and it just got worse and worse over time with the deprivation of food. UNICEF reports that the number of children suffering from acute malnutrition increased 80 percent just from February of this year to March of this year--80 percent increase. That is because children have no food. Parents have watched helplessly as they see clothes that once fit their toddlers hang off their brittle bodies, their kids' bony ribcages and shockingly thin limbs. Increased malnutrition means it is even harder to recover from bombing-induced injuries, a higher risk of miscarriages, a higher risk of mothers not being able to breastfeed their babies. It means babies are weaker. It means adults are weaker, children are weaker. Often, it is not malnutrition--that is, starvation--that kills someone; it is the weakened body dying from other diseases. And as noted before, the impacts on the development of the brain and the development of the body of the children can last a lifetime. World Health Organization representative Rik Peeperkorn warned that ``without enough nutritious food, clean water and access to healthcare, an entire generation will be permanently affected.'' I might add, the effects are not just those of malnutrition but also the trauma of being under constant bombardment over the course of this war, often without a home, often without electricity, often without clean water, often without access to medicine, often watching your family members die. So these children--at a minimum, we should make sure they have food, at a minimum--at a very minimum. We probably can't reverse many of the traumatic effects that will affect their lives. Just like we know trauma affects those who go to war, these are children and civilians living through the effects of war. The World Health Organization reports as of May 13 that almost 5 dozen children had starved to death in Gaza. If dozens of children have died from starvation, how many thousands of children more are on the verge of a devastating level of malnutrition and potential death from starvation? The headlines tell the escalating and devastating story to the world. On March 2, the day the blockade began, the Washington Post headline read:  Israel halts all aid to Gaza as ceasefire falters.  On April 1, 1 month into the blockade, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said:  Fear of famine looms after all Gaza bakeries run out of flour amid month-long Israeli blockade.  May 4, 2 months into the blockade, NBC News:  Starvation looms as Israel's total blockade on Gaza enters its third month.  You start seeing the word ``starvation'' appear in story after story, headline after headline. If you or I could travel to Gaza right now, we would be absolutely shocked to see the bodies of the adults and the bodies of the children, but we can't travel there because it is closed to all of us. But reports from credible news organizations have been alerting us to this horrific disaster coming from using food as a weapon.  Starvation looms as . . . blockade enters its third month.  In mid-May, the New York Times had a headline:  In Private, Some Israeli Officers Admit That Gaza Is on the Brink of Starvation.  So we have heard time and again from the Netanyahu government: Don't believe international organizations--even though they are experts. Don't believe because we are telling you there is no problem. But even the Israelis are telling the world there is a problem, that Gaza is on the brink of starvation. Then, on May 16, President Trump, our President, ``acknowledges starvation in Gaza as Israeli airstrikes kill more than 100.'' The President said the United States will take care of the situation in Gaza on the final day of the Gulf tour in Abu Dhabi. Why don't we join together, Democrats and Republicans, and support President Trump in having the United States take care of the situation, address the starvation in Gaza? That is the moral thing to do. That is the right thing to do under any religious code. We have this incredibly close relationship with the Israeli Government. We are their primary source of economic support. We have close technological support. We have a close security relationship. We share intelligence. We have many connections between members of our government and our military and our intelligence community and theirs. Why not support President Trump in using these connections to end the starvation in Gaza? You know, starvation happens many places in the world where we don't have a close relationship with the government and it may seem very distant, but here, we are complicit because we are so closely tied and so supportive of the Israeli Government. So we have a special responsibility to address this and use every leverage at our power to end it. Facing week after week of these horrifying headlines, world leaders pressed Prime Minister Netanyahu to end this strategy and implement a new plan. Only after, it was reported, ``Israel's closest friends,'' meaning U.S. leaders, warned the Israeli Government that it would lose international support because allies could not handle pictures of mass starvation did Prime Minister Netanyahu consider changing course. On May 19--so now we are talking just about 3 weeks ago--after more than 11 weeks of an all-out blockade, Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that--and he used the word ``minimal''--a ``minimal'' amount of food would be allowed into Gaza. But that plan is hardly satisfactory. The new U.S.- and Israeli- backed organization, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has taken over aid distribution, working in partnership with the Israeli military and private U.S. security contractors--they are distributing aid from just four sites--one in central Gaza near the Netzarim Corridor and three in southern Gaza in the Rafah area. Civilians have to get to one of those four sites to obtain a box of food. If you have visited Israel, you know that Gaza is about 40 miles long from north to south. It is a thin wafer along the Mediterranean coast. How do four sites, with three of them at the very southern end of that 40 miles, possibly get food to 2.1 million people? It needed hundreds of kitchens before to get food distributed throughout the country. So what you have is a formula that says millions of people are going to descend on these four sites to acquire a box of food. The logistics of that are impossible, and they are meant to be impossible. It is deliberately designed not to work because there is no way that four sites can handle handing out food to 2.1 million people. So it has produced chaotic scenes, with desperate crowds--crowds of men, women, and children--rushing toward boxes of aid to try to get one of those boxes and then warning shots being fired--and not just warning shots, shots that killed Palestinians. Warning shots don't kill people. On Sunday, June 1, ABC News reported that 31 people were killed and 200 injured when the Israeli troops opened fire. On Tuesday June 3, the BBC reported 27 civilians were killed by military gunfire for ``deviating from the designated access routes'' while desperately trying to collect food. On Wednesday, June 4, less than a week ago, the BBC called Gaza ``worse than hell on Earth,'' as the Israeli military closed its aid distribution sites for the day, warning that roads leading to the sites are ``combat zones.'' How do 2.1 million people get to the aid sites if the roads leading to the sites are combat zones and if each time the food distributions are open, people end up dying because they are shot? On Sunday, June 8, the New York Times reports that about a half mile from a distribution site, shots were fired and ``five people were killed and 123 were wounded.'' Yesterday, morning--here we are on Tuesday--Monday, yesterday, June 9, the Associated Press reports ``14 people were killed'' on their way to a food distribution center. This is not a plan designed to address the hunger, to end the malnutrition, to end the starvation. This is a plan to make it virtually impossible for the Palestinians to get food while telling the world: Don't worry, we have a distribution plan. Everyone understands this is not a plan designed to provide food. It is a plan designed to make sure that very little food gets just to a small number of people so that the starvation continues and gets worse, the malnutrition continues and gets worse, the impact on the ravaged bodies of children and babies and women and seniors and all kinds of folks who had nothing ever to do with Hamas continue to decline. The New York Times interviewed many Gazans who said they go to the distribution sites when they are closed despite the warnings of the Israeli military because they ``are desperate for food . . . and seeking to get ahead of large crowds.'' If there is only a few boxes and the site is only open for a few minutes, you are willing to wait all night because your family is starving. You want your kids to survive. You want your spouse to survive. You want to survive yourself. Of course, you are going to try to beat the crowd there, but you know it is impossible the food will be sufficient for everyone to walk away with a box of food. Yesterday, June 9, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation announced the opening of an aid distribution center in a post on its Facebook page, only to post again the center had completed distributions less than 20 minutes later and closed. It was open for 20 minutes. Of course, you are going to try to beat the crowds. It is only going to be open for a few minutes. There is only going to be a modest number of boxes--nothing that could possibly serve thousands of people, let alone hundreds of thousands, let alone 2.1 million people. Of course, you are going to try to go early. And the foundation closed a second center ``because of the chaos of the surrounding crowds.'' Whenever you have starvation, you are going to have chaos around food distribution centers. Early in this conflict, when I went to Rafah gate in January of 2024, the International Aid Organization said we are pushing to make the point that if there isn't sufficient food, eventually, the trucks carrying food will be raided because people will be desperate. That always happens when people are desperate--not as a particular condition of the situation in Gaza, but wherever people are starving, they are going to raid the trucks to get food. They won't wait for a warehouse that has very little food in it to open up inan orderly fashion because there isn't enough food for everyone, so they are going to make that effort to get that food for their families. So this chaos--this was understood that this would be this way. It is not something that is, if you will, incidental to the plan. It is the plan--not enough food, not enough distribution centers, not open long enough--deliberate effort to make hundreds of thousands of people compete with each other for a few boxes. That is chaos. Aid groups say the Netanyahu government system will be ineffective in reversing the widespread hunger because not nearly enough food is being allowed in. The United Nations has called the food that is being let in ``a drop in the ocean.'' Food is being distributed far from where it is needed most, especially for the elderly and people with disabilities. How are they going to travel? It is a 40-mile-long strip of land. How are they going to travel if they are disabled, if you are elderly, to compete with hundreds of thousands of people trying to get to just four distributions centers? It is impossible. Dangerous and deadly chaos at food distribution sites is being fueled not through some clever plan by Hamas, but by the deprivation of starving civilians who hope to keep their families and their children alive. And that desperation is the direct and inevitable result of Netanyahu government's strategy of deliberately imposed starvation. Even if civilians could make that dangerous journey safely, the amount of aid in this new system is wholly insufficient. During the cease-fire in the winter, 600 trucks a day entered Gaza. Only a few hundred trucks have been allowed into Gaza over the last week, and the World Food Programme reports only one-third of their trucks reached their destination. A handful of World Food Programme bakeries actually did resume bread production on May 22, but the supplies were so limited that World Food Programme Country Director Antoine Renard warned:  This is just a drop in the bucket of what is needed to reverse the catastrophic levels of hunger. We are in a race against time to prevent widespread starvation.  The World Food Programme reports that:  Over 140,000 metric tons of food--enough to feed the entire population for two months--is pre-positioned at aid corridors and ready to be brought into Gaza at scale.  Just as I saw in January of 2024--trucks piled up for miles waiting to try to get in. Here we have a World Food Programme reporting that now, again, food is ready to move in, but the Netanyahu government is blocking them. On June 8, 2 days ago, Janti Soeripto, the CEO of Save the Children told Face the Nation:  When we had the pause in fighting from January `til March, as you will recall, we got trucks and trucks of supplies in at scale, [and] we were able to deliver, [and] we treated children with malnutrition, [and] we did vaccinations, [and] we did medical care, [and] hospitals were operating . . . So this current new mechanism doesn't seem to work. The failings seem to play out exactly the way that we warned against. It is also the militarization of aid--  I am continuing this long quote--  It is the militarization of aid--if you put men with guns near a distribution point and you ask a desperate, desperate, starving population to come and walk for miles to get boxes of food . . . you're going to create crowd control issues and increased risk of harm to an already incredibly desperate population.  That is the end of the quote. And that is exactly what we are seeing happen. As CNN reported yesterday, June 9:  Aid to Gaza hangs by a thread amid looting and starvation.  Let's be clear: That trickle of aid is not about Prime Minister Netanyahu ending food deprivation as a weapon of war. It is continuing food deprivation as a weapon of war while deflecting just enough international pressure to keep himself in power. Jonathan Whittall, lead of the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Palestinian Territories, said May 28:  The newly developed distribution scheme is more than just the control of aid. It is engineered scarcity. The new distribution model cannot possibly meet Gaza's needs.  The same day, Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian Authority's representative to United Nations, told the Security Council:  Children are dying of starvation. The images of mothers embracing their motionless bodies, caressing their hair, talking to them, apologizing to them--it's unbearable.  And on May 30, the New York Times reporting led with the headline:  In Emaciated Children, Gaza's Hunger Is Laid Bare.  Every moral and religious code says this is wrong--wrong to withhold food, wrong to induce starvation. And under international law, it is a crime. Rule 53 of Customary Humanitarian Law states:  The use of starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare is prohibited.  It isn't prohibited because it was some bureaucratic decision. It is prohibited because it is completely wrong under every religious and moral code--people who had no role--no role--being punished collectively; being punished the way that kills children, kills babies, kills adults. Other countries are speaking out in opposition to Netanyahu's government's use of food as a weapon. On May 19, the Governments of the United Kingdom and France and Canada issued a joint statement saying that the amount of food the Netanyahu government is allowing into Gaza is ``wholly inadequate.'' Even Israel's leaders from across the political spectrum are speaking out that this is wrong. Amit Halevi, from Prime Minister Netanyahu's Likud party, said:  This war is a deception [and it] is not succeeding in destroying Hamas.  Yair Golan, the leader of Israel's Democrats party, said in a radio interview:  Israel is on the way to becoming a pariah state, like South Africa was, if we don't return to acting like a sane country. A sane country [that] does not fight against civilians.  Even former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert wrote in the newspaper on May 27:  What we are doing in Gaza now is . . . indiscriminate, limitless, cruel and criminal killing of civilians.  He continued.  . . . Yes, Israel is committing war crimes.  Mr. President and colleagues, this use of food as a weapon of war should never have happened, and it has to end. We know that the United States has such a close relationship with Israel that we can apply multiple levels to push the Netanyahu government to end it. We have a moral responsibility that is heightened by our close relationship between our two nations. We should have acted long ago to end this strategy--the strategy of malnutrition and starvation. But that provides no excuse for not acting now. I pressed the Biden administration to act, and I will press the Trump administration to act. There was that moment of hope in December when Trump said we will address this situation. Colleagues, I have witnessed the horror of starvation in multiple countries around the world. I believe that if the Netanyahu government would let us as Senators go and witness firsthand, a bipartisan delegation going to Gaza, we would come back and speak from the depths of our hearts, the ferocity of our understanding of right and wrong, that we have to press for this strategy of starvation to end. But we are not allowed in, so we have to depend on the press reports that have come from international organizations who have people on the ground in Gaza, from news reporting, from competent international sources. We have a profound responsibility to pressure the Netanyahu government to end its strategy of starvation through food deprivation and deliver a massive influx of aid immediately. It is tempting to look away. There is a lot more going on in the world. But it is wrong to look away. We must carry that responsibility on our consciousness. We must speak and act forcefully to end the Netanyahu government's strategy of deliberately starving 2 million men, women, and children in Gaza. I yield the floor."
"I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Greene), who is the author of this piece of legislation."
"I applaud all the efforts by podcasters and tradespeople who are going online and sharing their experiences. Any hon. Member can look up the likes of Stolen Tools UK or the Gas Expert on Instagram and they will see cases, every single day, of people having their tools stolen and the damage that is doing to their financial and mental health. The impact of this on the wider economy is now so severe that we must act: Parliament must act across party to change the law--today, I hope. I also thank the police and crime commissioners across the country who are getting stuck into the problem. I have highlighted examples from the Met of Sidcup and Havering police forces in particular, but I know that the PCCs in Kent and Sussex are also doing great work tackling this issue. As I have highlighted, this is not a party-political issue and I appreciate the work of the hon. Member for Portsmouth North (Amanda Martin) in shining a spotlight on it. Today we can work cross-party and get the law changed now, and I hope, in all sincerity, that all MPs get behind this amendment and that the Government can help us change the law today, get on the side of the makers and tackle the lawbreakers."
"I absolutely think it is not helpful to go against those women. New clause 1 would retain the criminal prosecution of men who force women to have an abortion, or indeed anyone who coerces a woman into having an abortion. One in eight known pregnancies end in miscarriage, yet we have seen women subjected to invasive investigations, delayed medical care and lengthy legal processes because they have had an abortion or a stillbirth. Many colleagues have already spoken about the intense distress that legal proceedings inflict, whatever the circumstances. In the case of Nicola Packer, it took four years to clear her name. During that time, the scrutiny she faced was entirely dehumanising, with completely irrelevant matters treated as evidence of wrongdoing. For every woman who ends up in court, many more endure police investigations, often including phone seizures, home searches and even, in some cases, having children  removed from their care. All that not only is distressing and disproportionate for those women, but makes abortion less safe. If women are scared of being criminalised, they will not be honest with their midwives, GPs or partner. Abortion is healthcare, and healthcare relies on honest conversations between care providers and patients. I will rebut a bit of the misinformation that says that new clause 1 would allow abusive partners or others to avoid prosecution. That is simply not true. NC1 applies only to the woman who ends her own pregnancy. Healthcare professionals who act outside the law, and partners and other family members who use violence or coercion would still be criminalised, just as they are now, and quite rightly so. The amount of misinformation about abortion is distressing--I have seen it within and without this Chamber. What are the facts? Some 88% of abortions happen before nine weeks. As a woman who has lost two very-much wanted pregnancies at about that stage, I am very aware of what that actually means physically, and of what stage the foetus is at then. Abortions after 20 weeks make up just 0.1% of all cases, and those are due to serious medical reasons. Women are not ending their pregnancies because of convenience. NC1 would not change what is happening with abortion care, but it would protect women from being dragged through these brutal investigations, which are completely inappropriate in the majority of cases anyway. Women are extremely unlikely to try to provoke their own abortion outside the time limits. A criminal sanction for that, or a distressing and intrusive investigation, is entirely disproportionate. It is not in the public interest to subject these women to these investigations. I will finish with this: women who have abortions, women who have miscarriages and women who have children are not distinct sets of women. Many of us will experience at least two of those things, if not all three. Let us stop making false distinctions and trying to pit groups of women against each other, and let us stop brutally criminalising women--many of them very vulnerable women--in the way that the current law does, because it serves no purpose. Today, we can end that."
"With permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The two-state solution is in peril. There is catastrophic conflict in Gaza and a shocking deterioration in the west bank. This is an affront to the rights of Palestinians, but it is also against the interests of Israelis; against their long-term security and their democracy. Today I will update the House on new actions we are taking to uphold human rights and defend the vision and viability of two states living side by side in peace. In 2024 we saw the worst settler violence against Palestinians in the west bank in the last two decades, and 2025 is on track to be just as violent. Between 1996 and 2023, an average of seven illegal settler outposts were established annually. In 2024, settlers erected 59. These outposts are illegal under both Israeli and international law. Two weeks ago, the Israeli Government themselves announced 22 new settlements in the west bank. Every outpost and every building the settlers erect is a flagrant breach of international law and disregards the views of Israel's international partners. There are now in excess of 500,000 settlers living in the west bank and over 100,000 in East Jerusalem, the territory that must form the heart of a sovereign, viable and free Palestine. The sharp growth in settlements alone is dangerous enough, but it has been accompanied by a steep rise in settler violence and extremist rhetoric. Itamar Ben-Gvir has led seven provocative intrusions into Haram al-Sharif since 2022. In 2023, settlers rampaged through the village of Huwara, in what Israel's own west bank military commander described as a ""pogrom done by outlaws"". Last month, the villagers of Mughayyir al-Deir fled their homes in fear after the construction of an illegal outpost 100 metres away. This month, settlers attacked the town of Deir Dibwan. They set fire to houses and injured residents. This violence and rhetoric are deeply concerning. They are an assault not just on Palestinian communities but on the very fundamentals of a two-state solution. This is an attempt to entrench a one-state reality where there are no equal rights. The two-state solution remains the only viable framework for a just and lasting peace--and I know that it is supported on every side of this House--with Israelis living in secure borders, recognised and at peace with their neighbours, and free from the threat of terrorism; and with Palestinians living in their own state, with dignity and security, free of occupation. We are steadfastly committed to defending that vision, not just with words but with action. That is why we have pledged PS101 million in additional support to the Palestinian people this year, and why we are working to strengthen and reform the Palestinian Authority. It is why my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary signed a landmark agreement with Prime Minister Mustafa, and why my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister welcomed him to Downing Street. It is why we are clear that Hamas must release the hostages immediately and unconditionally, and that Hamas can have no role in Palestinian governance. It is also why we are committed to working with civil  society, Israeli and Palestinian, to support those who believe in peace and coexistence. However, the gravity of the situation demands further action. The reality is that these human rights abuses, the incitement to violence and the extremist rhetoric come not just from an uncontrolled fringe but from individuals who are Ministers in this Israeli Government. We must hold them to account and protect the viability of the two-state solution. So today we are sanctioning Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir. We are acting alongside Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway, which have also announced their own measures today. These two men are responsible for inciting settler violence against Palestinian communities in the west bank--violence that has led to the death of Palestinian civilians and the displacement of whole towns and villages. That violence constitutes an abuse of Palestinians' human rights. It is cruel, it is degrading, and it is completely unacceptable. We have told the Israeli Government repeatedly that we would take tougher action if this did not stop. It still did not stop: the appalling rhetoric has continued unchecked; and violent perpetrators continue to act with impunity and encouragement. Let me tell the House that when we say something, we mean it. Today we and our partners have shown extremists that we will not sit by while they wreck the prospects of future peace. Our actions today do not diminish our support for the security of Israel and the Israeli people. The agendas of those two men are not even supported by the majority of Israelis, who recognise that those individuals are not working in their interest. As the Foreign Secretary said to this House last month, we want a strong friendship with Israel based on shared values and our many close ties. Our condemnation of Hamas--a proscribed organisation --and of the appalling attacks of 7 October is unequivocal. Our commitment to the security of Israelis and the future of Israel is unwavering. We will continue to press for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, for the release of the hostages still held so cruelly by Hamas, and for a ramping up of aid to those Gazans in desperate need. The repeated threats by Hamas to the lives of the hostages are grotesque and prolong the agony of their families and loved ones. Hamas should release all the hostages immediately and unconditionally. The situation in the west bank cannot be seen in isolation from events in Gaza. Extremist rhetoric advocating the forced displacement of Palestinians, the denial of essential aid, and the creation of new Israeli settlements in the strip, is equally appalling and dangerous. This Government will never accept the unlawful transfer of Gazans from or within Gaza, or any reduction in the territory of the Gaza strip. The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains catastrophic. As Israel's ground and air operations expand, Gazans have now been pushed into less than 20% of the territory. Hospitals have been damaged and destroyed. The entire population of Gaza is now at risk of famine. Meanwhile, Israel's newly introduced measures for aid endanger civilians and foster desperation. They are inhumane. The Red Cross field hospital in Rafah reported last week that it has responded to an unprecedented five mass-casualty incidents in the two weeks prior. In each case, Palestinians have been killed or injured trying to   access aid in Gaza. Desperate civilians who have endured 20 months of war should never face the risk of death or injury simply to feed themselves and their families. We need further action from the Israeli Government now to lift all restrictions on aid, to enable the UN and aid partners to do their work, and to ensure that food and other critical supplies can reach people safely wherever they are. We will continue to support the UN and other trusted non-governmental organisations as the most effective and principled partners for aid delivery. Our support has meant that over 465,000 people have received essential healthcare, 640,000 have received food, and 275,000 have improved access to water, sanitation and hygiene services. We of course support the efforts led by the United States, Qatar and Egypt to secure an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. We welcome the initiative of France and Saudi Arabia to chair an international conference next week to advance a two-state solution. A two-state solution is the only way to bring the long-lasting peace that Israelis and Palestinians deserve, but it cannot remain an empty slogan repeated by generations of diplomats and politicians while increasingly divorced from the reality on the ground. Mr Smotrich has said there is no such thing as a Palestinian nation. Mr Ben-Gvir has spoken of his rights in the west bank--a territory that his Government are occupying--as being more important than the rights of millions of Palestinians. Their own words condemn them. To defend those Palestinians' rights, to protect the two-state solution and to see Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in safety and security, this Government are taking action. I commend this statement to the House."
"Is the Minister not concerned that he has lost the audience among wildlife organisations and trusts that say they are offended by Ministers' portraying nature as a blocker to development rather than an enhancement to life and the economy, and are now asking for part 3 of the Bill to be scrapped?"
The hon. member for Simcoe North.
"today, I want to honor new Eagle Scout Nathaniel Mignano, who during his time with the scouts, earned an impressive 30 Merit badges, achieved a high number of awards, and completed an outstanding Eagle Scout project. Nathan started eleven years ago as a Cub Scout and now has accumulated merit badges across a multitude of categories, including Citizenship in the Nation and the Community showing just how patriotic Nathan is. He also earned badges in personal fitness and hiking, and earned the National Outdoor Achievement Award by obtaining the Camping Award and two gold pins by completing additional tasks. Throughout his time as a Scout, Nathan hiked over 250 miles, kayaked 13 miles, and spent 70 nights camping in the wild. For his Eagle Scout project, he made major improvements to the Elephant Swamp Trail by installing a larger flower bed, and adding plants to the entrance sign as well as put in new mile markers and birdhouses every quarter mile. Nathan is homeschooled, so he is exercising his high school option as a student at Rowan College of South Jersey, where he is on the President's List and a member of the Honor Society. He has expressed interest in following in his family's footsteps and becoming an attorney, or possibly a National Park Ranger. I have no doubt Nathan will be successful in any endeavor he decides to pursue. God bless Nathan and God bless our United States of America. The greatest country in the world."
"Does the Minister prefer peanuts, cashew nuts or simply scraps for Wales? The fabled ""two Labour Governments in lockstep"" is simply a myth for voters. Changing rail classifications and short-changing Welsh communities is a true reality. Is the Minister concerned about today's reported peanuts? When did she become aware of the paltry settlement of just over PS400 million that is to come to Wales? How will that be split for the Welsh Government? How does it compare with our Government's PS740 million for rail alone? What specific action did she take to argue for a fair share for Wales, and for its place in the Union?"
"Mr. Chair, no monies have been recovered, no legal action has been taken against GC Strategies, no steps have been taken whatsoever to recover tax—"
"Mr. Speaker, in a simple word, I do not trust the government. Where is the budget? Again, we get back to the issue of $9 billion. Where is that money, where is the revenue and how is it to be spent?"
"I am genuinely looking for clarification. As a former Cabinet Minister in the Scottish Government, I jealously guard the devolution settlement. I wonder how the extension of some of these clauses to include Scotland will be interpreted. What conversations have taken place between my hon. Friend, Scotland's Lord Advocate and the Scottish Government?"
"The hon. Member is absolutely right to raise this matter. Antisocial behaviour massively impacts on individuals and their communities, and that is why we are introducing 13,000 new neighbourhood police and giving them better powers--respect orders--so they can actually deal with what they see on the streets effectively. It is very important that we take this seriously."
"I am happy to join my hon. Friend in congratulating the community on its success, and I agree that we need funding for these critical services. The placing of socially necessary services on a statutory footing is a beneficial change to the enhanced partnership model, as it ensures that local authorities assess the impact of service changes and consider alternatives. The Bill also rightly lifts the outdated, ideologically-driven ban on municipally-owned bus companies, empowering local authorities who wish to use it, rather than infantilising them. Taken as a whole, the measures create an improved set of options from which local authorities can choose the approach that works best for them. As the Secretary of State noted, it is important to realise that this is not, and must not become, a one-size-fits-all approach. Not every local authority will wish to pursue franchising, establish a bus company or abandon the partnership model. What works for Greater Manchester or London may not work for Oxfordshire or Cornwall. It must be up to local leaders and, ultimately, local communities to decide what works best for them. I welcome the fact that the Government are not mandating a certain approach. Therein lies the challenge: empowering local authorities in law is one thing, but enabling them in practice is quite another. Although the Bill hands councils a set of keys to a new bus network, it does not ensure that there is fuel in the tank. Franchising is complex, resource-intensive and unfamiliar to the vast majority of local authorities. It requires legal expertise, commercial understanding, operational planning and, above all, funding. The Department for Transport has acknowledged those difficulties, yet this legislation provides little to help overcome them. The Government's laudable desire to increase their own capacity to advise councils is welcome, but I am not convinced that they are doing enough. The recently established Bus Centre of Excellence, which we will no doubt hear much about during the passage of the Bill, is a positive development, but does it really have the necessary capacity and resources to provide meaningful support to all those who might need it? If we are to see franchising become a viable option beyond a handful of combined authorities, we must take bolder steps to offer councils without either the expertise or the finances more than just a helpline or homilies on best practice. Every hon. Member in this House knows how overstretched their local authorities are--with the exception of our colleagues from Reform, of course, who are sadly absent from today's debate, no doubt too busy frantically searching for the untapped resources and savings they confidently promised they would discover  in their new fiefdoms. As for the rest of us, we know that most local authorities lack the finances, expertise and bandwidth to use the tools the Bill provides. As a result, only the local authorities that already have the capacity to do so will use them, which will exacerbate regional disparities, not reduce them. Even if we overcome such problems, that will not remove the continuing role of central Government in securing access and affordability. That is why the Government's reckless decision to raise the national bus fare cap from PS2 to PS3 casts a dark shadow over the Bill. The original PS2 cap was not only popular but effective. It reduced costs for passengers and helped to bring people back on to the bus network. It was precisely the kind of policy of which we need more, not less. Increasing fares by PS1 per trip may not sound prohibitive, but for those on low incomes or families making multiple journeys, the change represents a significant cost increase, adding PS20 to the cost of a weekly commute to anyone who has to take two buses to work while only saving the Government PS150 million. Let us be clear: this increase is regressive. It will hit the poorest hardest, particularly at a time of a cost of living crisis. Surely the Government should commit to preserving affordability, not undermining it, as raising fares in the absence of service improvements risks entrenching decline, not reversing it. Even more worryingly, rumours are now doing the rounds that the fare cap may be removed altogether. That would be a catastrophic mistake. We must not allow the progress of recent years to unravel in a Treasury-pleasing piece of virtue signalling that will only save the Exchequer a further PS150 million. A thriving, affordable bus network is not a luxury but an essential public service. This Bill must ensure that that is the case. Nowhere is that more true than in our rural areas. As we have seen for years, the current unregulated bus market is failing small villages and remote hamlets, serving them neither efficiently nor sufficiently."
"I notice that not one Reform MP has turned up to hear an announcement that benefits so many working-class kids. I first joined a governing body of a primary school in  my constituency in 1986 and served for 37 years. From Thatcher to Sunak, I saw what was going on in our schools, and I never saw need like that under the last Conservative Government, so this is a very welcome statement indeed. But even this measure and all the other measures that I understand the Government are considering will not result in fewer children being in poverty in 2029 than are in poverty now unless we remove the two-child benefit cap. I want to add my voice to those who have already asked the Minister to assure us that the cap is being looked at."
"Mr. Speaker, I believe I am already following his account, but I do not think he is following mine. I would like to return the invitation. Let us move on to another topic. We know that starting next January, the European Union will begin imposing tariffs on imports from countries that do not have carbon pricing. It has even stated that it will start with high-emission sectors, including steel and aluminum. In Canada, the government has made changes to the carbon tax. Earlier today, we even heard the Prime Minister say that he was proud to have scrapped it. What guarantee do we have that this will not negatively impact our exports to the European Union?"
"I have to say to the hon. Member, the story of Israel's nuclear ability goes back some long way, to the 1980s--I remember studying this many years ago. We work with Israel, and we remain a country that does not want to see nuclear proliferation. We will do everything we can to ensure that others do not get nuclear capability in the region."
"It is a pleasure to follow such excellent contributions from Members from all parts of the House in this important debate. I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Graham Stuart) on securing this vital debate. I pay tribute to the parents, the carers, the schools and all those who have battled tirelessly to secure funding for SEND students. I was one of those SEND students who benefited from my parents tirelessly campaigning for me to have the disability support I needed in school. It has only taken me this long to finally say thank you. Such support plays a vital role in children's long-term success. Members from all parts of the House have raised this issue today because they can see the merits in fighting for children's chances, particularly in primary school, to increase their success overall. We know that finding the right provision can be difficult and bureaucratic for children with SEND and their families. Securing the right assessment of a child's needs, getting their education, health and care plan, and finding the right provision takes huge effort and far too long. Many parents who have come to me have been absolutely choked and suffocated by the system. Too often, children with SEND face a postcode lottery, with suitable provision too far from their home or, in the worst cases, no suitable provision at all. According to the 2024 data, we now have 1.67 million children who have been identified as having SEND-- 18.4% of all school pupils. We know that the number has grown significantly over the last few years, which is why the Conservatives opened 108 new specialist schools, committed to a further 92 and delivered over 60,000 new special needs school places. The growth in children with SEND is why getting the distribution of funding correct really does matter. We know that not enough of the funding is reaching schools and the children who need it the most. We know that as the number of children with SEND has increased, the deficit from the high-needs block has become financially unsustainable, as many Members have alluded to today. That is why we must confront the challenges facing local government when the statutory override ends in March 2026, and we would like to hear what assurances the Minister can give on how councils can address the deficit."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There have been consultations among the parties—"
"Madam Speaker, I am thankful for this opportunity. First and foremost, I congratulate you on your role as Assistant Deputy Speaker, as well as all the members who were elected in this 45th Parliament. I trust in your capabilities to diligently live up to your role as a non-partisan and be fair to members of all parties during the term of this Parliament. I can tell that so far you are doing great. It is an honour and a privilege to become a member of Parliament, and I am humbled to be the first member of Parliament for the new riding of Edmonton Southeast. I want to thank all the residents of Edmonton Southeast who put their trust in the Conservative Party and in me. It was because of their trust and efforts that I won the seat for the Conservative Party, with one of the biggest mandates in the country. This is despite the fact that the Prime Minister himself spent half a day in my riding just before the election date. It shows that my riding was ready for a change and was ready to get the answers that the Liberals have failed to give in the last 10 years. How can I thank the people of Edmonton for the support I got? Honestly, I cannot thank them enough in words, but I can definitely thank them by representing them in Parliament as their rigorous voice whenever and however it is needed and by making sure I hold the Liberal government accountable for its actions. Edmonton Southeast is a diverse and ethnically rich riding, and I want to thank all the churches, synagogues, gurdwaras, temples, mosques and other religious congregations for extending their unwavering support to me. I also want to thank all my volunteers, the group captains, my nieces, my nephews, my three naughty yet wonderful kids and my lovely wife Mandeep for their tireless work and effort to make this dream come true. The work they did, day and night, was commendable. I also want to extend a special thanks to my younger brother Chand, who I am lucky to have as my brother. I could not have done this without his organizational skills and foresightedness. Moving forward, I want to talk seriously and bring to the floor some of the issues I heard about while door knocking, such as crime. I want to tell members about a young, hard-working Canadian in my riding named Harshandeep Singh. She was gunned down by a repeat offender on bail in the city of Edmonton. Another young Canadian was killed while at work by another person who was there. Even earning money and running successful businesses in Edmonton and the rest of the country have become a curse and a nightmare. I personally know business owners who have received threats of extortion and ransom calls, and they are forced to live in hiding. From door manufacturing companies to realtors to restaurant owners, no one is safe. I personally know families who were escorted by police out of Edmonton to live in a different place. If people do not pay money, bullets are fired at their houses and death threats are delivered to them and their family members and to their businesses. Newly built homes are set on fire if homeowners do not meet the demands of the criminals and pay them money. Cars are stolen in the GTA and Montreal and are found in Nigeria and South Africa, and the Canadian police and CBSA do not have any clue. I urge the Liberal government to correct its mistakes by immediately repealing Bill C-5 , which removed mandatory minimum penalties, and Bill C-75 , which made bail easier, and bringing in stricter laws for repeat offenders and for violent crimes, such as human trafficking, hard drug trafficking, arson and extortion, so that successful Canadians can feel safe and enjoy the fruit of their hard-earned money. I also want to talk about immigration. The immigration system has been broken in this country. This has had a direct impact on the health care system, housing and policing. Immigration needs to be based on quality and not quantity, yet at the same time, the government must stand in solidarity with international students and try to extend their visas as much as possible before providing visas to new immigrants. Our first and foremost duty is to accommodate international students and people who are already in Canada, but that does not mean we should promote the bogus claims that refugees make after being in Canada and not being successful in getting permanent residency in this country. Refugee claims and pre-removal risk assessments have literally the same requirements to be successful, so why burden Canadians with added bureaucracy? I have seen CBSA officers in my practice as a lawyer who have turned down LMIAs for not being genuine. If a CBSA officer is the ultimate decision-maker, why burden Canadians with Service Canada bureaucracy and why not give all the work permit powers to CBSA officers? The next point I want to touch on is unleashing oil and gas. I have never seen such bigotry and hypocrisy at the hands of government. Alberta holds one of the largest oil and natural gas reserves, but the Liberals have failed to pass laws and legislation to build pipelines and to secure deals with global partners to unleash the energy sector of Alberta. Rather, the Liberals have passed legislation like Bill C-69 , making sure that our oil and gas stay under the ground. What is even worse is that the Liberals have turned down building needed infrastructure and killed the LNG deal with Germany, a deal worth billions of dollars that could have generated hundreds and thousands of jobs. The continuous denial and ignorance of Alberta's genuine demands have led to a strong feeling of separation. Believe me, it is not trivial; it is real this time. I am a strong believer in Canada and its unity, but the onus is now on the Liberal government if it wants Canada to stay together. If the Liberals want Canada to be together, then this is the prime time to unleash Alberta's oil and gas and make sure Alberta feels listened to and honoured. That is what unity and Confederation are anyway, is it not? As for soaring house prices and affordability, the rising cost of houses for new Canadians in Edmonton has been inexplicable. I hear Liberals talk about aggressively building houses, but they are not saying whether Canadians get to own those houses or whether they are just playing into some sort of scheme. I see the Speaker signalling that my time is up, but there are so many issues that I want to touch upon, like jobs. We need jobs in Edmonton. We need infrastructure in Edmonton. We need to make sure that oil and gas get out to market. I want to thank all my constituents, my riding and my family. I will stand strong in Ottawa, and I will make sure that the Liberals are held accountable on jobs, the fight against crime, building pipelines and building more infrastructure."
"Oh, oh!"
"To reassure you, Mr Speaker, you look much younger than the Calder Hall nuclear power station."
"Mr. Speaker, the strong borders act will help keep Canadians safe. The bill will go after transnational child sex offenders via information sharing with our international policing partners, give law enforcement the tools it needs, choke off organized crime's illegal profits with a crackdown on money laundering, grant our border officers provisions to search export containers and stop auto theft rings. We will do this while ensuring the charter rights of Canadians and due process to make sure that our civil liberties and privacy rights are protected."
"I, too, will keep my remarks brief, but I wish to put it on the record that Devon, which is rightly celebrated across Britain for its rugged coastline, its rolling farmland, its spectacular moorlands and its ancient woodlands, is subject to the diggers of developers who are encouraged by this Government. Although we all need houses and we all need the protection that they afford, this Bill, if enacted, will only damage nature. Nature in Devon is part of who we are and we face a nature crossroads. The Devon Local Nature Partnership tells us that the loss and decline of Devon's wildlife has accelerated rapidly over the past 50 years. The wooded valleys of the Blackdown hills and the wildflower meadows of East Devon are priceless, but once they are gone, they cannot be brought back. Yesterday in the Tea Room, we were talking about the darkening clouds of the international system and how this Government are having to deal with such grave matters of state. Somebody then pointed out that, never mind grappling with wars and conflict, we cannot even create a system where a PS44 swift brick is put in a new house to encourage nature in our rural areas. Healthy natural systems underpin our economy and our communities, but unless we restore nature, we will have nothing left. Building homes does not need to come at the cost of nature. We must build in the right places with nature embedded at the heart of planning. Question put, That the Bill be now read the Third time."
"I agree very much with my hon. Friend. Next week I will be meeting finance Ministers from the devolved Governments in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. We will put forward today's update on our infrastructure strategy and seek to partner with them as best we can to deliver for people and places across the whole of Scotland. But given the track record of the SNP Government, I am afraid that I do not have a huge amount of confidence."
"This is a critical time, Mr. Speaker. Unfortunately, I do not think people realize the extent of it. The public does not understand, and neither do the members of this House. We have only been sitting in this House for three weeks and the government is already imposing a gag order, even though it is a minority government. The bill under closure has not been debated. There has not been a single hour, a single minute, or even a single second of debate, and they are already imposing a gag order on us. Normally, when a gag order is imposed, it is because Parliament is deadlocked or because there is a real emergency, a fire is raging and everyone agrees that it should be passed without a hitch. However, that is not the case here. What is worse, they want to impose a gag order on something that will be profoundly transformative. Passing this bill will radically change how the federal government functions and how major projects are approved once presented to us. That, too, is cause for concern. Even more concerning is that the wording of the motion states, among other things, that parliamentary committees will have only a day and a half to examine the bill, and that witnesses will be heard at a time when it is no longer even possible to propose amendments. That is crazy, but that is what is being presented today and what a majority of members in the House seem prepared accept, on both the Liberal and Conservative sides. I am rather surprised by all of this, because it is a denial of democracy. The government is trying to ram through a bill that was never publicly debated. Almost no member of civil society has had the opportunity to carefully analyze or comment on the bill, including the media and experts in the various fields affected by the bill's provisions. The fact that the government is already imposing a gag order on us is really very serious and problematic. Keep in mind that this is a major bill, not some harmless little piece of legislation. What is the aim of this two-part bill? We do not have a real problem with part 1, despite the somewhat provocative way in which the Liberals presented it. This part, which deals with the free trade of goods and services and labour mobility, is ultimately not a bad thing, since it involves the federal government withdrawing from certain jurisdictions. The federal government is recognizing provincial jurisdictions and telling us that it will not get in the provinces' way. The government is removing barriers. In fact, it is removing its own barriers. I personally do not want any federally imposed barriers, and I do not think many of my Bloc Québécois colleagues do either, so that is a good thing and we support it. Part 2 is another story. That part requires a very thorough analysis, and that is why we really want to split this bill. Part 2 of the bill would essentially make it so that certain laws do not apply to major projects that are deemed to be in the national interest. What are those so-called national interest projects, and how will they be chosen? Well, we just do not know. The bill provides some indications, but it does not specify exactly what those projects are, nor does it define the criteria. The criteria in the bill are suggested criteria. They are recommendations. The minister can choose whether to consider them or not. It is up to him. That is absolutely crazy, but that is how it is. In theory, the criteria are to strengthen Canada's autonomy, resilience and security; provide economic benefits to Canada; have a high likelihood of successful execution; advance the interests of indigenous peoples; and contribute to clean growth and to meeting Canada's objectives with respect to climate change. However, these are non-binding objectives. The minister can basically do what he wants in terms of the application of these criteria. The decision is at his discretion. The minister makes a list, and that is that. He decides which projects will be exempt from the law. How do projects get on that list? It is done by order in council. That means there is no public debate. No one can question whether it is a good or bad project. The minister can wake up one morning and decide that it is a good project. He does not need to ask anyone's permission. Actually, that is not quite true. He has to consult the first nations and the provinces, but all he has to do is consult them and that is it. He does not have to do anything else. He just has to consult them and that is the end of it. What does it mean to consult? It does not mean that everyone agrees. It does not mean that Quebec agrees to be steamrolled. It does not mean that the first nations agree to have projects imposed on them. It just means that someone talked to them about it first. That is all that it means. On the basis of consultation alone, the minister can decide that he has enough information to proceed with an order in council and make the project in question a priority. He can circumvent everything and disregard laws that we thought were unassailable. What happens when a project is on a list? The project is automatically approved. It had not even been analyzed when the Governor in Council issued an order for the project to be added to the list and approved. It stops there, no public debate, no questions. Before it is even debated and reviewed, before any environmental assessments are done, without any regard for processes, the project is automatically approved. That is real progress. What legislation would not apply to these major projects? There is a whole list in schedule 2 of the bill. There are 33 statutes, including the Fisheries Act, the Indian Act, the International River Improvements Act, the National Capital Act, the Canadian Navigable Waters Act, the Dominion Water Power Act, the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, the Canada Transportation Act, the Canada Marine Act, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999, the Species at Risk Act, the Canadian Energy Regulator Act, and the Impact Assessment Act. As if that were not enough, there are also regulations that are not automatically applicable to these major projects. We are talking about the migratory bird sanctuary regulations, the Dominion water power regulations, the wildlife area regulations, the marine mammal regulations, the port authorities operations regulations, the metal and diamond mining effluent regulations and the migratory birds regulations, 2022. That is scary enough. We might say that, with a list like that, anything goes. However, that is not all. Clause 21 of Bill C‑5 states that the Governor in Council may, by order, add any other act or regulation to this schedule, without any public debate, without going through Parliament and without consulting anyone. What could those acts be? What acts could be affected? It could be the Official Languages Act, and then bilingualism and francophone rights would no longer be respected. The government could add the Canada Labour Code and not comply with it for these major projects. It could no longer comply with the Income Tax Act and people would not have to pay taxes. It could no longer comply with the Criminal Code. That is not written in the bill and it does not say that the government will do that. However, if it chooses to do so, the way this bill is currently written would allow it. That is completely scandalous and unacceptable. I cannot believe that my peers in the Conservative Party of Canada, or anyone else, would support this and say that there is no problem, that they would hand the government a blank cheque and that the government could do whatever it wants for all eternity. Worse still, it shows that this government is taking cues from the government south of the border. What we were critical of and what everyone wanted to be protected from was a government that acts arbitrarily, imposes its agenda without consulting or listening to anyone, and governs by decree. What we have before us is a government that wants to govern by decree. How are projects chosen? It is by decree. How are the criteria set? They are being set by the minister alone. How can existing laws not apply to major projects? They are excluded by decree. This government wants to govern by decree, and now it wants to impose a gag order. It is unacceptable for a Parliament to pass such legislation. This bill absolutely needs to be thoroughly studied in committee by experts. This bill undermines our democratic institutions and public institutions. Worse still, it would put this government in untenable situations where it could easily be influenced by lobbyists with their own particular agendas. The minister would be very susceptible to this, because there would be no one to block him and no checks and balances. I could go on at length, but, unfortunately, I am out of time. In conclusion, I would say that shutting down debate on the motion before us is just one reason for that, so I would like to move an amendment that could make it a little better. The amendment reads as follows. I move: That the motion be amended: (a) in paragraph (b)(ii), by replacing the words “at 3:30 p.m.” with the words “at 10 a.m.”; (b) in subparagraph (b)(ii)(B), by replacing the words “until 5:30 p.m.” with the words “until 11:59 p.m.”; (c) by adding the following after subparagraph (b)(ii)(C): “(D) the following people be summoned to appear as witnesses for a minimum of one hour each at one of the two committee meetings: (i) the Prime Minister, (ii) the President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada and Minister responsible for Canada-U.S. Trade, Intergovernmental Affairs and One Canadian Economy, (iii) the Minister of Transport and Internal Trade, (iv) the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, (v) the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations;”. All those people could come explain the bill to the committee. We would also—"
"I thank my hon. Friend for allowing us to put on record our thanks for all the work that our transport police do, day in, day out. He is right that it is completely unacceptable for them to face abuse and be unable to do their job properly, and I think that would make a very good topic for a debate."
"I respect the right hon. Gentleman's belief, and I will always defend his right to it. I tell him this, however: the human rights of the woman carrying the baby are intricately related to the ability of the baby to survive. If we do not look after women and protect their wellbeing, there will be no babies. The human rights test allows us to ask whether it matters to us that we treat women equally when it comes to the regulation of this healthcare procedure. Practically, it also means that there is somebody to champion those regulations. In Northern Ireland, the human rights commissioner has taken the Government to court when access to the procedure has been denied. She has established buffer zones and safe access to abortion clinics as a human right. Indeed, she is now looking at telemedicine as a human right, and at how to provide it for women in a safe way."
The hon. member.
"Mr. Speaker, the Green Party agrees to apply the vote and will be voting yes."
"I rise today because the Republicans' budget scheme pushed through in the middle of the night last month is putting school meals for hungry kids and food assistance for working families at risk. A constituent of mine, Martha, from Somersworth is raising her 15- year-old grandson and battling breast cancer while living on a fixed income. Without SNAP, she wouldn't be able to keep food on the table. Another constituent, Catherine, is a veteran from Manchester who has type 2 diabetes. She wouldn't be able to afford the diet she needs to keep herself healthy without SNAP and fears losing her benefits could put her life at risk if she is unable to manage her blood sugar. People across my district, from Newmarket to Gilford, tell me they wouldn't be able to afford groceries without some help. It is a betrayal of working families for Republicans to take away food so they can give tax breaks to billionaires.  My colleagues must continue speaking out against these cuts and do everything they can to stop a reckless, cruel budget from moving forward."
"Will the Minister join me in celebrating the five new neighbourhood police officers we have in Harlow? I cannot take all the credit for them, because I only taught one of them maths."
"I rise today with a heavy heart in support of H. Res. 519. What happened in my State of Minnesota was a painful reminder of the growing threats that public servants face simply for doing their jobs. Speaker Melissa Hortman was a friend, mentor, and fierce advocate who dedicated her life to public service. The assassination of Melissa and her husband, Mark, and the harm done to Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, is a tragedy that should shake all of us, regardless of party. This resolution calls on us, on both sides of the aisle, to take that violence seriously.  {time}  1530  Recently, we have seen acts of political violence minimized, joked about, and used as a talking point. This has to stop. This job is never supposed to come with a target on our backs. Political violence has no place in our democracy. If we truly believe in the work that we are doing here, then we have to protect the people who serve. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution."
The hon. member.
I will.
"I rise to speak to new clause 47 in my name. This is a very simple new clause, in a way, about how we stop mobile phones that have been stolen from being reconnected to the cloud and sold on. If we can break that link, we can stop the proliferation of mobile phone theft, which has increased by 150%. Some 200 mobile phones are snatched every single day, and there has been a marked increase in Westminster. I know that a number of MPs have had their mobile phones stolen--some of them are sat not too far away from me. The amount of money in this crime is incredible. I do not believe phone manufacturers are that keen to stop this crime, because I feel it is part of their business model: when somebody has their mobile phone stolen, they go and buy another mobile phone. New clause 47 says that once somebody's phone has been stolen and they report it to the police, the police must report it to Apple, Google, Samsung or whoever, which then stops that phone from being reconnected to the cloud. In effect, that phone would become inactive. If the manufacturer failed to do that within 48 hours, it would be fined PS10,000. We need to ensure that the manufacturers take this issue seriously, because they are not. Here is the simple thing: if we want to stop mobile phones being stolen to order, we need to ensure that the manufacturers take the issue seriously. We need to ensure that IMEI numbers are easily accessible, and we need to ensure that thieves cannot reconnect the mobile phones."
The hon. member for Simcoe North.
"Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for his speech on the carbon tax. I would like to ask him, as he is a new member of the House, how he feels about running on the idea and platform of a carbon tax, only to come to the House and find out the carbon tax has been axed, as in the Conservative platform. Is that something he can now defend to his constituents?"
"Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the minister for joining us today. I am pleased that she is willing to participate in this exercise. I hope it will be positive and constructive as well as informative for those who are listening. First, I would like to mention that I will be sharing five minutes of my time with the member for Gaspésie—Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Listuguj . On January 10, the government announced that it would eventually run out of funds for the incentives for zero-emission vehicles program. That was on a Friday, and 48 hours later, on Monday, January 13, suddenly there was no more money in the incentives for zero-emission vehicles program. Unfortunately, when we looked at the appropriations that the government announced for government operations and submitted to the House for approval, we did not see any additional funds allocated for this program. Does the minister know how many car dealers in Quebec have been affected by this situation? Does she know what costs dealerships have had to absorb by granting rebates on vehicles in good faith when they failed to receive the money from the government afterwards?"
"Mr. Chair, Canada has a free trade agreement with the United States, which the United States has consistently violated. We are on our fifth version of that violation now. Every time, we have stood up for—"
"Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is a pleasure to stand opposite the right hon. Lady. Despite what many may think, we have a great deal in common, not least that we both viscerally disagree with the Chancellor's tax policies. It is also great to see the right hon. Lady standing in temporarily for the Prime Minister for the second week running--although I know that many sitting behind her wish that this was a permanent arrangement. Indeed, we will find many of their names among the 122 who have signed up to oppose the Government's welfare Bill. They say that the Bill is dangerously rushed and ill-thought-through. Will the right hon. Lady explain why she thinks that she is right and 122 of her colleagues are wrong?"
"Mr. Speaker, the responsible thing to do is exactly what we did, which was to lower taxes for 22 million Canadians. That was the responsible thing to do. The responsible thing to do is to ensure that Canadians have more money in their pockets. That is one of the best measures of affordability. On this side of the House, we will continue to fight for families, for children and for seniors. Together, we are going to build Canada strong."
"Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister 's first four weeks have been filled with broken promises on spending, consultants, defence spending and relations with the U.S. Now the Parliamentary Budget Officer has confirmed another broken promise, this time on tax cuts. He advises us that the average Canadian will save only $7.50 a month and low-income seniors will save even less, under five dollars a month, under the Liberal proposals. Perhaps it is not a surprise the Prime Minister will not table a budget this spring, because so much of what he is saying now is so different from what he said during the election. I am curious: Did the Prime Minister deliberately mislead Canadians during the election, is he misleading them now or is it both?"
"Happy birthday, Mr Speaker. While I welcome this fantastic announcement, Scotland will unfortunately not benefit due to the SNP's ideological block on nuclear power, blocking billions in investment and thousands of well-paid  secure Scottish jobs and blocking growth across our Scottish communities. Does my right hon. Friend agree that Scotland and, indeed, Ayrshire need a new political direction, and that the only way to get that will be at the ballot box next year?"
"I thank my hon. Friend for that question. We will build more housing, which is what the investment in affordable homes grants will achieve, and that goes alongside transport investment--significant transport investment--in the west midlands and Birmingham. I was very pleased that my hon. Friend joined me in Birmingham last week, when we were able to celebrate the investment to extend the Metro out to east Birmingham and then to Solihull."
"I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I do not disagree that drugs are used for different things; that is not the thrust of the argument that I am making. What I am saying--relatively clearly, I hope--is that when the drugs we would potentially use in these situations have been used, there have been unintended consequences and side effects. We must ensure that the drugs we use, if the Bill passes, are absolutely effective in what they are intended to carry out: namely, the end of the life of the individual."
"Mr. Speaker, once again, it is important to acknowledge the work of Peel Regional Police, as well as their colleagues in the different police services, who work together to ensure that drugs are off our streets. This matter is going through the courts, and I know that our justice system is strong. We will ensure that there will be continued work, collaborative work, within police services so that we can constructively get drugs off our streets."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her question. The Canadian dental care plan is changing the lives of Canadians. Since the Canadian dental care plan was implemented, more than two million Canadians have accessed services. As of May 29, 2025, all eligible Canadians between the ages of 18 and 64 can register to access these services."
I move to proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 145.
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I think House Republicans know that we can't simply schedule our way out of this crisis, but they have refused to pass bipartisan solutions that address prevention, treatment, and recovery to help stop overdose deaths. I know that they passed reauthorizing the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act last week, but the bottom line is that all of the programs under the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act that have helped with treatment, helped with education, caused the number of overdose deaths to decline are being gutted. The staff that administer them and SAMHSA, the program that they are under, all of these things are being either eliminated, gutted, or the funding frozen by the Trump administration. My point today is this is not just a criminal justice issue. We must combat this opioid crisis through a multipronged public health approach. Nearly half of all people in Federal prison today have been convicted of a drug-related offense, with a racial and ethnic disparity among those convictions. Access to treatment remains a challenge today. In 2023, according to SAMHSA, approximately one-quarter of the people who are classified as needing substance use treatment received it in the last year. People with a substance use disorder who are untreated are eight times more likely to die of an overdose compared to those who receive medication treatment. Just putting people away and throwing away the key is not the answer. Cutting back on the treatment programs, and the education programs under SAMHSA, is certainly going to make things worse. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"Mr. Chair, is the member asking me what Canada's population is, of people who live in Canada?"
"I certainly do not think that we need the amendments. The assurance board is made up of representatives of both Houses, the HR department and other appropriate people, which is as it should be. It also includes a Member of this House, who I think will be contributing shortly and who is also a member of the House of Commons Commission. The make-up of the assurance board as proposed is right."
"Mr. Speaker, last week, we witnessed a truly momentous occasion, something that Canadians want to see: the premiers of all the provinces and territories sat down with the Prime Minister of Canada to see how they can work together. We must be united. We need to work together. That is something we are committed to every day."
"Mr. Chair, I thank the member."
"My hon. Friend is absolutely right, representing, as he does, a beautiful part of Scotland and one with huge potential for such schemes. That is why Great British Energy announced PS4 million of funding for community energy projects in Scotland, working with the Scottish Government to drive those forward. We see, as my hon. Friend rightly points out,  the huge benefits not just of delivering clean power, but of the social and economic value for the communities that host it. We are clear that community-owned energy has huge untapped potential and huge benefits for communities. We want to see much more of it, and Great British Energy will help deliver it."
"My local economy on the Isle of Wight is entirely reliant on ferry services for the movement of people, the delivery of products and, in the case of tourism, for customers. Will the Minister acknowledge just how important unregulated ferry services are for the entire economic wellbeing of the Isle of Wight?"
"I rise today to recognize the outstanding contributions that Steven Walker has made to the community through his work at CREST in Lecanto. Steven created a food drive as a class project to help local Veterans. This food drive was used to educate the students about the struggling Veterans in the community and to teach about the importance of service to others. This project has also opened their hearts to lend a helping hand to others in need. The students look forward to this food drive every year and have such pride in participating. The students also speak around the town to spread the word about the food drive and garner support. For students struggling with physical and or mental health limitations, this program has been an invaluable tool for teaching about citizenship. It is clear Steven Walker has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility."
"I was pleased to read in the SDR about the importance of building on the 2024 joint declaration on the Norwegian-UK strategic partnership, which recognises the autonomy of both countries and the strength that comes from working together. Does my right hon. Friend agree that that important partnership would be further strengthened if Norway decided to purchase the Type 26 frigates--the best frigates in the world--that are built in Govan, in Glasgow South West, and Scotstoun, in my Glasgow West constituency?"
"I thank the right hon. Member for his intervention. As I discussed extensively during the Bill Committee, there is a misunderstanding here of exactly what the Bill is doing, so I fundamentally disagree with the point he makes, but I will go into more detail on it in my speech. One of the first things one learns about as a budding metrologist is the concept of perfection. In his book ""Exactly"", Simon Winchester writes of what he refers to as ""the perfectionists"", detailing the evolution of the science of metrology through time and how precision engineering has been used to create the modern world that we inhabit. It is a great read, covering the history of my science in the popular mindset. However, I do not necessarily agree with Winchester in his core thesis; he talks about metrology as the science of perfection, whereas it is more accurate to think of it as the science of the good enough. I will elaborate on that shortly. In the early days of a metrologist's training, we learn that with more money and more time, a precision engineer can almost always achieve a more precise and accurate result, whether a straighter line, a smoother surface or a better piece of legislation, but that striving for true perfection--the absence of any fault--is always folly. Our resources are never infinite, and in the real world it is always more appropriate to strive for the good enough as opposed to the perfect. Good enough is the core of modern engineering and the fulcrum on which our world balances. I am, as many colleagues will know, by trade a metrologist, but within the broader field, I am a surface metrologist. Surface metrology revolves around the measurement and characterisation of surfaces--surface texture and surface topography. I am the one who decides whether the leather steering wheel feels right. I am the one who ensures that car engines distribute and hold oil in all the right places to keep them running smoothly. I am the one who ensures that tyres keep us firmly planted on the road as we round corners. Becoming a surface metrologist involves gaining an intimate acquaintance with the very concept of perfection. Always in engineering I hear people asking for a product to be made perfectly--for the angle of the corner of the table to be exactly 90deg or for the surface of the microscope to be infinitely smooth. Let me put it on record that there is no such thing as perfection in reality."
"I include in the Record the following newsletter to give an update to my constituents on the Helene Small Business Recovery Act, tax cuts, and beneficial ownership reporting.  Dear Friend, Communities throughout Western North Carolina are continuing to pick up the pieces to rebuild after the worst natural disaster to ever hit our mountains made landfall on September 27, 2024. This includes our district's small businesses, which were hit particularly hard due to the loss in tourism following the disaster. Small businesses are the lifeblood of WNC's tourism economy and many of them were left suffering from Helene's destruction. Thus, federal support is vital to helping folks rebuild their livelihoods and the region's economy. That's why I introduced the Helene Small Business Recovery Act to facilitate small business owners' access to federal aid for rebuilding after Hurricane Helene. This bill clarifies that Small Business Administration loans and federal grants, like those that will be offered through the CDBG-DR program, are not duplicative. Without this clarification, businesses that took an SBA loan to keep themselves afloat would be prohibited from accessing federal grant money when it becomes available. Loans and grants are inherently different, and my bill will allow small business owners to access both federal resources so that WNC, and every small business that makes our mountains such a great place to live, has the resources needed to recover. Relieving the tax burden for hard-working Americans: Americans are benefitting from lower taxes because of the tax cuts that President Trump implemented during his first term. However, the tax relief secured in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is set to expire next year, and if these cuts are not extended, a family of four in North Carolina will face a tax hike of about $1,400. To prevent tax increases for workers and businesses nationwide, I'm working with my colleagues to extend and potentially make permanent President Trump's 2017 tax cuts. This would ensure we avoid the largest middle and lower class tax increase in American history, stimulate job growth, make American businesses more competitive, and support American workers by helping them keep more of their hard-earned dollars in their wallets. Small business victory over beneficial ownership reporting requirements: Small businesses saw a major victory in the fight against beneficial ownership reporting requirements with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's new ruling that exempts U.S. small businesses from having to report Beneficial Ownership Information under the Corporate Transparency Act. As we move through the 119th Congress, I will continue to be a voice for WNC's small business owners whose hard work benefits our communities and strengthens our economy. With my warmest regards, Chuck Edwards, Member of Congress."
"We are co-producing this review, and it may result in changes that require primary or secondary legislation or other action, and I do not want to pre-empt that. Let me just bring my hon. Friend and the House back to the purpose of these changes: to ensure that we have a system that is fair for those who need support and fair for taxpayers, and to try to put the welfare state on a more sustainable footing for the future. If we do not do so, my real fear is that it will not be there for the very people who really, really need support going forward."
"Order. Please sit down. This is a very important subject and I congratulate the hon. Lady--she did ask me at the beginning and it is fantastic news--but I have to get a lot of Members in today. So, please, I am sure the Leader of the House has grasped the message."
"Madam Chair, will the minister apologize to Canadian workers who have lost their job due to the Liberals' inability to resolve these issues?"
"Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my colleague on his speech. He said that Quebec cannot get a refund for the carbon tax because it has its own system. I did not realize that having an independent system meant that we will not be treated fairly. We are going to have to sort something out. The carbon tax refund was supposed to be paid out on April 22, but the tax was abolished on April 1. The finance department simplified things by saying that the refund of the infamous carbon tax was for the period from April 1 to June. How can the government refund something that was never collected? Quebeckers pay taxes to the federal government, unless my colleague can prove otherwise. If a refund is being given for something that was never paid, it is only fair that we ask for our fair share. I would like my colleague to tell me what he thinks of the unanimous decision by the 125 members of the Quebec National Assembly to demand that Ottawa reimburse Quebeckers their $814 million. Does he think those MNAs are liars or just idiots?"
"Do the Secretary of State and the Minister agree that the industrial towns and villages that make up Lanarkshire must be central to any modern industrial strategy? Will they meet me, potentially in Airdrie and Shotts, to hear more about the excellent skills and potential that exist throughout the constituency that could undoubtedly contribute to their and this Government's ambitious work?"
"Mr. Chair, the cost of the housing infrastructure can affect it, depending on the market across Canada. The market in some markets, such as Toronto and Vancouver, is much higher than the percentage-driven—"
"I congratulate the Government on the bold action they are taking to end the feudal leasehold system for good, which will ensure that future flat owners will never again be treated as second-class homeowners. But as the Minister is well aware, there are millions of existing leaseholders, including thousands in my constituency of Hendon. Will he update the House on the work the Department is doing, building on the path forward outlined in the commonhold White Paper, to strengthen protections for existing leaseholders, including on the conversion of leaseholds, ground rents and right to manage?"
"My constituency of Ribble Valley sits under Lancashire county council, which recently received a damning Ofsted report for its SEND provision. One parent, Selina Shaw, told me that her son Monty lost two years of education while the council spent more than PS146,000 on a school he never attended, as the council did not seem to understand that that school could not meet his needs. Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government and local authorities must listen seriously to the voice of the child and to parents to improve SEND provision and must stop wasting precious resources in the immediate term, as well as providing the long-term financial improvements that the right hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Graham Stuart) proposes?"
"Today's announcement that PS2.5 billion will be invested in the small modular reactor programme is fantastic news for the country. It will help bring energy bills down, power homes and create jobs. It is amazing news for Derby, too, because the technology behind the SMRs has its roots in the technology developed at Rolls-Royce Submarines half a century ago. As the Government move forward with investment and delivery, and the Secretary of State approaches the contractual aspects, will he ensure that we build on what we have in Derby, such as the Nuclear Skills Academy, and the good jobs already there, so that we can grow opportunity for the wider region and the country as a whole?"
"I rise today to honor the strong-willed commitment Richard Koch holds for the people of Cabarrus County, North Carolina. Mr. Koch served as the Cabarrus County Attorney for 19 years alongside serving as the County Planning and Zoning Attorney for an impressive 32 years. Mr. Koch earned his undergraduate degree from Washington and Lee University, where he was a member of the swimming team. He then went on to earn a Juris Doctor degree from Wake Forest Law School, and he has been a licensed attorney for 47 years. Mr. Koch currently serves as both the Administrative Law Judge for North Carolina Occupational Safety and Health, and the Harrisburg Town Attorney, which he has been doing for 37 and 32 years, respectively. Serving on two boards, the Historic Cabarrus Board and the Cannon School Board, there is no doubt that Mr. Koch is dedicated to his county. Over the past 37 years, Mr, Koch has exemplified high levels personal sacrifice and commitment to Cabarrus County. The magnitude of his efforts and dedication cannot be overstated. Renee and I offer our most heartfelt appreciation to Mr. Koch for the decades of loyal service he gave to Cabarrus County. We wish him continued success and happiness as he moves forward on to his next adventure. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in honoring Mr. Richard Koch for the lifetime of service he dedicated to his community."
"It is good to see you in the Chair, Sir Roger. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton Itchen (Darren Paffey) on securing the debate--he genuinely is an hon. Friend. We served together on Southampton city council, we have both been education lead members, and now we are constituency neighbours. I know that he consistently stands up for the great people of the great city of Southampton, and in particular the constituents he has mentioned today. I pay tribute to Joe's mum for the work she has already done and the work she will do in future to make sure we lose fewer people on our waterways across the country. Although the hon. Member for Southampton Itchen and I share Southampton Water, which is the busiest part of the waterways around and into Southampton, I also have in my constituency the entirety of the River Hamble, which comes off Southampton Water. The River Hamble is internationally known as one of the most difficult rivers to navigate for our sailing and boating community. It is known as an international sailing hub but also as one of the most difficult tidal waterways to navigate across the world. We saw that, unfortunately, in 2020, early in my career here as the Member of Parliament for Eastleigh, which is in the same area. Emily Lewis, who was on a fast boat in the Solent, was tragically killed after being catapulted out of it when it hit Netley buoy. She was travelling at 44 mph, and two charges were eventually made of manslaughter and failure to ensure safe navigation against the person who chartered the boat. The hon. Member for Southampton Itchen is absolutely right that we need to have water safety education. I put it to the House and the Minister that we also need to have proper education for not only those who enter the water through our seasides, lakes and rivers, but also people who use the water on a daily basis. As I said, we have the whole of the River Hamble in the constituency of Hamble Valley, and a vast array of people use our rivers and Southampton Water--sailors, motorboaters, kayakers, paddleboarders and rowers. Many people use the river, as they should be able to, because that is intrinsic to the identity of those who grow up and live in my constituency. Given the hot weather this weekend, I intend to go out on the Hamble on Saturday to kayak, but I am aware of the intrinsic dangers of a river such as the Hamble. It is vital, as the hon. Member for Southampton Itchen said, that we educate from a very early age. I also want to outline and make colleagues aware of the role of our independent lifeboats. Hamble lifeboat in my constituency has already been called out over 60 times this year. We must raise awareness of these services, because they play a very important educational role for many people in our constituencies. I was delighted to be a founding member of the National Independent Lifeboat Association, which looks after our independent lifeboats, alongside our former colleague Anthony Mangnall, who was the Member for Totnes. I encourage all Members who represent areas with independent lifeboats to get in touch with NILA and to raise awareness of water safety. The hon. Member for Southampton Itchen highlighted the key variations in access to swimming pools and water education. As I indicated in my intervention, we will both be aware, from our time leading the education system in Southampton, of the number of schools there that have had closures. This is not a political point at all, because we have both been in control of the Administration, and we have had national Governments of different colours, but he will be aware of a reduction in funding for our education system from local authorities, whereby many schools have had to close their pools. Partnerships that allow kids to be taken to local leisure centres for school lessons have been reduced as well. I remember being a young person--I used to be young once--growing up in Lewisham. The council school bus would come and take me to Lewisham swimming baths every week for a two-hour swimming lesson. That has diminished, and it is vital that we work on a cross-party basis to get swimming lessons and water education delivered to people across the UK. As I said, this is not just about young people. A brief story: a couple of summers ago, I was out on my kayak when I saw an older gentleman clinging to a kayak in very cold water. He had lost his energy and would have died that day, had I and my friend Jerry not gone past and rescued him. He was not wearing a life preserver, he was very cold, and he was running out of energy, clinging to his kayak. We managed to take him out of the water and save him, and get him medical attention. Frustratingly, such things still happen, which is why any measures taken forward by the Minister need to be attentive to not only young people but all users of the rivers and waterways across the UK. I congratulate the hon. Member for Southampton Itchen and all Members who will speak in today's debate. He has my commitment, alongside that of my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden and Solihull East (Saqib Bhatti) and, I am sure, the shadow Minister, that this is a cross-party issue that we all need to work on. I wish the hon. Member well in his endeavours."
"I thank the hon. Member for raising a very good point, which I will come to later. I agree completely; this has been particularly difficult for many people in the light of the crises we have faced in recent years, with the soaring cost of living and sky-high energy bills. This is what has happened to my constituents in Edinburgh West who have come to me with their issues with the administration of the remedy--not the remedy, but the administration of it--and the possible future impact on other pension schemes. One of my constituents who was affected is a retired police officer who served 25 years. His pension scheme was forcibly changed in 2017 to the CARE--career average revalued earnings--scheme, which was found to be discriminatory. He retired in February 2023 with his 25% lump sum, on the assumption that the remedial scheme would be in place by October that year. He estimates that he is now owed more than PS30,000 in terms of both his commuted lump  sum from the new scheme and the lower monthly pension. He is also one of thousands of immediate detriment officers still waiting for their remediation letter from the pension authorities, despite claims that the number of retired officers receiving these has accelerated, including in Scotland. Another constituent started working for Lothian and Borders police, as it was, in 1996 and retired in 2022, knowing he would only receive his pension for his service between 1996 and 2015, while the remedy was calculated. He was told at the time that he would receive his remediable service statement by April 2025, three years after his retirement. He also estimates a loss in pension income of more than PS30,000, given that seven years of his service to our community was not counted when he first retired. A third constituent of mine has raised a possible issue that he faces when retiring with an NHS pension. The Government's approach to NHS pension remedies means that pension growth will be calculated under an older scheme from 2008, even if he believes this rollback leaves those in the middle of their careers vulnerable to artificial breaches of the annual pension allowance and significant income tax charges because of the set-up of the 2008 scheme used for calculation."
"Mr. Speaker, we are not waiting; we have already taken action. We already have tools in the toolbox. My colleague is from Beauce, so he should be familiar with toolboxes. We have plenty of tools in our toolbox to help our people."
"Mr. Speaker, it has been 18 months since the tragic disappearance of Earl Moberg, a beloved husband, father and grandfather from my community. Mr. Moberg suffered from dementia and despite exhaustive search efforts, he has not been found and is presumed deceased. Unfortunately, by 2030, nearly one million people will be living with Alzheimer's in Canada, and nearly 60% will go missing at some point. Tragically, if they are not found within 12 hours, there is a 50% chance they will be injured or deceased from hypothermia, dehydration or drowning. This really underlines the urgency of finding our loved ones as quickly as possible. That is why there is an urgent need for a national silver alert system. Like the Amber alert system for children, it would rapidly notify the public when a senior with cognitive impairments goes missing in the area. To that effect, I have sponsored petition e-5196, launched by the Moberg family, urging the federal government to work with provinces and police to implement a national silver alert system to save lives by helping locate missing seniors faster. We must act now to protect our most vulnerable and prevent future tragedies."
"Mr. Chair, what is the number of students in Canada with fraudulent student visas?"
"I spoke to the hon. Gentleman before the debate, and I congratulate him on bringing forward this issue. In my constituency of Strangford, which is very similar to his, there are estates where the houses were built in the '60s and '70s. The roads are narrow and were never built for households with two or more cars, and the situation is aggravated when young people learn to drive. The Department back home came up with the idea of enabling those who have driveways to have a white line put across them,  so that cars cannot park in front. That is okay in theory, but it does not work, because cars have to go in and out, and there is a problem when cars park beyond the line. As the hon. Gentleman knows, that leads to frustration, anger and fisticuffs, and to neighbours falling out. If there is to be an initiative from this House--we look to the Minister for that--it has to start with legislation or direction from this place. Then councils can have responsibility for taking it to the next stage. Again, well done to the hon. Gentleman for bringing forward this issue. There is not one of us in this House who does not agree with him."
"Madam Chair, not only do I have the will, but I have the desire to present a great budget for Canadians that the member can be proud of and set in her own jurisdiction and her own riding."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1373, as amended, bipartisan legislation to promote additional transparency of board meetings of the Tennessee Valley Authority. I thank Representatives Cohen and Burchett of Tennessee for their leadership on this bill and their tireless work to improve the TVA. TVA is the Nation's largest government-owned wholesale power producer, supplying power to 10 million people across the States of Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and Kentucky. This legislation requires TVA's board meetings to be open to the public when possible, which will increase transparency for the communities impacted by TVA's decisions. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 1373, as amended, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let's make sure that we are dealing with the facts as they actually occurred. The assertion the LAPD had the situation under control; we all saw otherwise on our television sets. The LAPD chief himself said that every person in Los Angeles should be disgusted by what occurred. The Governor has, himself, in the past, recognized the virtue of using the National Guard when you had situations that required reinforcement. This notion that somehow the President was taking over the State's law enforcement authority, the Ninth Circuit said otherwise unanimously. Even a Biden-appointed judge said: The President was exercising his authority to prevent the disruption of the enforcement of Federal law. As to this notion that the violence was largely confined to downtown L.A., I can't agree with the assertion that it is somehow less objectionable to have violence occur within a concentrated area than on a more diffused basis. Finally, this disparagement of our ICE officers for wearing masks. I think that this is outrageous. We have seen threats against our ICE officers absolutely skyrocket. It is very ironic for folks that had no problem forcing 2 year olds to wear masks all day, in defiance of even the World Health Organization's guidelines, that are now somehow objecting to Federal officers who feel the need to do this in order to protect themselves and their family. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim)."
"on June 16, 2025, I missed rollcall vote No. 313. Had I been present, I would have voted no on vote No. 313, cloture on the nomination of Gary Andres to be Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services. On June 17, 2025, I missed rollcall vote No. 314. Had I been present, I would have voted no on vote No. 314, motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of Olivia Trusty to be a Member of the Federal Communications Commission for the remainder of the term expiring June 30, 2025."
Agreed. On division.
"Mr. Chair, as I mentioned, 10.1% is the debt servicing—"
"Mr. Chair, yes."
"Madam Chair, it is important that we protect the industry. Today I met with representatives of the canola industry, and we talked about tariffs and about markets we can open up. These are discussions that are happening at the highest levels to—"
"As Mr Speaker has already mentioned, in order for everybody to get in--well, in order for most to get in--we need speeches to be shy of six minutes, and interventions to be short. I call Gregory Stafford."
"Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present, in both official languages, the following four reports of the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities: the second report, entitled “The Erie Lake Connector: A Project in the Best Interest of the Public?”; the third report, entitled “Towards Accessible Air Transportation in Canada”; the fourth report, entitled “The Role of McKinsey & Company in the Creation and the Beginnings of the Canada Infrastructure Bank”; and the fifth report, entitled “Issues and Opportunities: High Frequency Rail in the Toronto to Quebec City Corridor”. Pursuant to Standing Order 109, the committee requests that the government table a comprehensive response to each of these reports."
Questions and comments. The hon. member for London West.
"Mr. Speaker, as I rise today with my first member's statement, I do so with deep gratitude for the fine people of South Shore—St. Margarets. I thank them for placing their trust in me in this historic election. I want to thank my partner Ken, my daughter, the thousands of students I taught for over 17 years in my career as an educator, and my family and friends for being my rock. I also want to thank the incredible volunteers who gave their time, energy and knowledge in this effort. We concluded with 87 events in a 37-day election. South Shore—St. Margarets is the heart of Canada's ocean playground. From Barrington to Tantallon, Caledonia to Lunenburg, our region is strong, resilient and full of heart. Together, in the House, let us invest in and build a future guided by compassion, opportunity, partnerships and strength, especially in rural Canada."
That was a bad example.
"I welcome the Foreign Secretary's calls to move this to a negotiated solution, and his focus on UK defence and security. He is right that Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon. However, history also teaches us, on regime change, that interventions aimed at regime change in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan have produced prolonged instability, not just in the region but far wider. What concrete lessons does he believe can be learned from this recent history in shaping Iran policy today?"
"The Minister seems to be in denial. As a former entrepreneur, I visit lots of businesses in my constituency, and I talk to them about their fears. Not a single one has anything positive to say about the Employment Rights Bill--indeed, they are concerned that it will reduce employment, not increase it, and it has been estimated that it will increase costs by more than PS5 billion. The Minister has been asked this before, so he has had  a lot of time to think about it: can he name a single business that publicly supports the Employment Rights Bill?"
"Madam Chair, Bill C-21 was brought in to protect the safety and security of Canadians. There are legal gun owners. There are hunters who legitimately hunt. It should not be impacting those individuals."
"The House will now proceed to tributes in memory of our former colleague, the Hon. Marc Garneau."
"moved that Bill C-4, An Act respecting certain affordability measures for Canadians and another measure , be read the second time and referred to a committee. Madam Speaker, I would first like to thank my colleagues. I also see a big smile on the opposition side. Congratulations on your election. I am pleased to see you presiding over our meetings. I appreciate the work you are doing and the professionalism and honour you bring to this position. It is my privilege to rise and take part in today's debate as we begin the very important second reading of Bill C-4 , the making life more affordable for Canadians act. I would note that the House has voted unanimously for the ways and means motion. This is a good start. It is a new Parliament, a new government and a new era of doing big things quickly. Canadians asked for a serious plan to change how we address the rising cost of living, which has eroded their quality of life over the past few years. They are calling for change that will put more money in their pockets, build the strongest economy in the G7, build one Canadian economy, not 13, and build a more affordable Canada. With Bill C‑4 , our government is delivering on this mandate for change. Bill C‑4 will implement the middle-class tax cut our government promised. It will give more than 22 million Canadians a tax break. It will save two-income families up to $840 a year, starting in 2026. With the adoption of the legislation, the lowest marginal personal income tax rate would be reduced from 15% to 14% effective July 1, 2025. This is great news. I can hear my colleagues cheering because they reflect the Canadians who are cheering at home for that. I see the same thing from the Conservatives. They are cheering silently on the other side of the House. The tax cut would help hard-working Canadians keep more of what they earn and build a strong future for themselves, their families and their communities. The benefit of the tax cut would go to those hard-working Canadians who need it most. This means that the bulk of the tax relief will go to those with income in the two lowest tax brackets, with nearly half of the tax savings going to those in the lowest bracket. What is more, Bill C-4 would start delivering tax relief almost right away. With the announcement of our middle-class tax cut, the Canada Revenue Agency can update its source deduction tables for the July 2025 to December 2025 period so pay administrators are able to reduce tax withholdings as of July 1. That means that individuals with employment income and other income subject to source deductions could begin to have tax withheld at the lower 14% tax rate as of July 1. That is excellent news. This middle-class tax cut is expected to provide $2.6 billion in tax relief to Canadians over the next six months and $5.4 billion in 2026. The middle-class tax cut is expected to deliver over $27 billion in tax savings to Canadians over five years starting in 2025-26. That is just the first step in putting more money back in the pockets of Canadians. We have more good news. This is a great day to be a Canadian, because the next aspect of the bill is eliminating the GST for first-time homebuyers on new homes up to $1 million. There is a lot to be cheering for. I can see, in the smiles of my colleagues, that they are cheering. It is a great Friday for the opposition as well. It used to be that the federal government helped build the housing that our growing population needs in this country. The last time we faced a housing crisis on such a broad scale was after the Second World War. In the face of crisis, Canada did what we do best as a nation: We came together, got to work, and put a roof over the head of tens of thousands of families. Canadians want their government to get back to the business of building homes, and that is what we are going to be doing. That is why one of the first decisions of our government was to eliminate the GST for first-time homebuyers on the purchase of a new home valued up to $1 million. The new first-time homebuyer GST rebate would mean upfront savings of up to $50,000 on the purchase of their first home. That is not all. There is really great news in the bill: The rebate would also lower the GST on homes between $1 million and $1.5 million for first-time homebuyers. There is a lot to celebrate in helping Canadians. As my colleagues in the House know, buying a home is often the largest purchase most Canadians will make in their lifetime. Purchasing a home is more than just a financial investment. Often, it is an investment in their future and their family. It is an investment in their retirement, their peace of mind and their comfort. It is an investment in the Canadian dream. By supporting Bill C-4 , we would be providing a significant increase to the already substantial federal tax support available for first-time homebuyers through programs like the first home savings account, the RRSP home buyers' plan, and the first-time home buyer's tax credit. By so doing, we will enable more young people and families to make their dream of home ownership come true, and we will enable more Canadians to begin investing in their future, their family, their retirement, their peace of mind and their comfort. Bill C-4 is just the first step in our ambitious plan to build more homes and ensure that the housing market serves Canadians, rather than vice versa. We will build on our GST cut for first-time homebuyers with a credible plan to build more homes, a true team Canada approach that will build the future of this country and help build the strongest economy in the G7. I want to applaud the work of my colleague, the Minister of Housing , who is going to do a great job in helping to build more homes in this country. I see that my Conservative friends are very excited, because there is a third measure that I am sure they are going to be cheering in their hearts and minds, and they are going to put it in their householder to make sure all Canadians are aware. We are going to be removing the consumer carbon price from Canadian law. In their hearts, I am sure they are going to be cheering, silently I must say this morning, but silently cheering because, as we know, the first thing that the Prime Minister did upon assuming his responsibilities was to suspend the application of the federal consumer carbon tax, effective April 1 of this year. This was a moment for this country. Cancelling the consumer carbon tax was the first step in our government's plan to ensure that Canadians can keep more of their hard-earned money. While it was effectively accomplished through government regulations, Bill C-4 would take the necessary step beyond regulatory suspension of the fuel charge by completely removing the consumer carbon price from law. At the same time, we will refocus federal carbon pollution pricing standards on ensuring carbon pricing systems are in place across Canada on a broad range of greenhouse gas emissions from industry. This means that a price on pollution for large emitters will continue to be a pillar of Canada's plan to build a strong economy and a greener future for our kids. We will ensure a system that is fair and effective. Industrial carbon pricing is one of the most important greenhouse gas emissions reduction policies in the government's comprehensive emissions reduction plan to bend the emissions curve and meet our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. Overall, the measures included in this bill will pave the way for economic growth in Canada. Our government has a plan to help Canadians keep more of their hard-earned money. It is a plan to protect them from the worst effects of the unjustified trade war, a plan to build the strongest economy in the G7, a plan to build more than anyone could ever take away from Canadians. Our plan is based on a new approach, where we spend less on government and invest more in the people and businesses that will grow our economy. Canadians elected the current government to stand up for our country and to build a strong economy that works for everyone. Canadians voted for change. Change means adjusting the way we do things, taking advantage of new technologies and saving money so we can invest more. It means focusing on results for Canadians and making sure that they get what they expect from their government. It is time for Canada to have a government that focuses on maximizing investments that drive growth and deliver results. Excellence and efficiency must guide all government actions. Canada is the best country in the world. America's unjustified trade war is an attempt to weaken us, and our sovereignty is under threat. We will not let that happen. We will fight it every step of the way. We will stand up for Canadians, our industries and our workers. It is time to build a future that makes Canada strong, and Bill C-4 is the first step in doing that for our nation. I encourage all of my colleagues to support the first steps of our plan to build a strong Canada by voting in favour of this bill. We are the true north strong and free, and we should all be proud to be Canadians."
"Mr. Speaker, I have an office in Calgary that is well known for its casework in immigration, and that casework in immigration is becoming more and more backlogged. The speculation on that is that the government is, pardon my phrase, ragging the puck so it does not have to deal with these issues. It can just drag things out, and hopefully people will eventually get the hint and move on. There are very few ways it can deal with the number of excess files it has at this point in time. I think it is going to continue to be that way. The Liberals are going to continue to bluster and will not be able to meet their own targets. How are they going to meet the timelines? The expected timelines are being extended all the time, and the government is outside its targeted guidelines repeatedly. This is something members of Parliament have to continue to give feedback on and—"
"Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the hon. member's comments. I particularly appreciated the list of suggested improvements. It certainly deserved more than 30 seconds in a 22-hour speech. The member made the comment that facts do not always fit the narrative and that that was very concerning for her, so I just want to put a few facts on the table that she omitted in her speech. From 2015 to 2023, global oil and gas production grew 5%. Over the same time, Canadian production grew 29%. That does not really sound like Canada falling behind the world; it sounds like Canada being a leader in the world. From 2006 to 2015, the time of the last government, not a single pipeline was built. That is another fact that I think needs to be on the record. Let us not talk about the past, because Bill C-5 is about building the future. It is about building the strongest economy in the G7. Even in a world that uses less oil, demand for Canadian oil will continue to grow, because we and our partners work in an environmentally and socially responsible way. My home province of Alberta understands this. That is why we were the first to introduce an industrial carbon tax in 2008—"
"Mr. Speaker, if it is the position of the government that it would like to take a look at the contracts that occurred over that period of time, and there is a finding that there was fraud on the government, that work was not delivered, that security clearances were not in place, anyone involved then should be banned for life from doing business with the Government of Canada, and let us get that money back too. However, today, the question is, is the government going to support this motion? Any government speakers rising today should indicate how far back we want to go to get Canadians their money back. I do not think there should be a limit, because we must get value for Canadians."
"Mr. Chair, I have with me a binder of independent analyses done on this, including a study done for the IMF. Truly and sincerely as a human, not a jouster, it is an issue—"
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose H.R. 2056, which would effectively nullify laws, policies, and practices duly enacted by the District of Columbia because I strongly support the ability of the residents of the District of Columbia to govern themselves on local matters. This is one of two D.C. bills that the House is considering this week to demonize immigrants. Let's be clear: The District of Columbia is in full compliance with Federal law. It does not obstruct ICE from carrying out its duties. D.C., like many other jurisdictions, limits its cooperation with Federal immigration agencies to what Federal law actually requires. Why do jurisdictions limit such cooperation other than the fact that immigration is a Federal responsibility? Let us ask the police chiefs for an explanation. The Major Cities Chiefs Association opposes such cooperation for four reasons: ``Enforcement of routine civil immigration by police would undermine the trust and cooperation with immigrant communities which are essential elements of community-oriented policing. ``Courts have held that the lack of legal authority to enforce Federal civil immigration statutes exposes police to liability for unlawful arrest and detention. ``Local agencies do not possess adequate resources to enforce these laws in addition to the added responsibility of homeland security. ``Immigration laws are very complex, and the training required to understand them and to properly prosecute them significantly detracts from the core mission of local police to create safe communities.'' Let's be clear again: D.C. is in full compliance with Federal law. It does not obstruct ICE from carrying out its duties, and it is backed by evidence demonstrating that limiting cooperation keeps people safer. Counties with laws that do not honor extrajudicial civil detainers have significantly lower levels of violent crime than counties that don't have such laws. Mayors, police chiefs, sheriffs, and local leaders across the country have made clear that the way to combat violent crime is allowing local police to do their job of ensuring public safety in their own communities, not commandeering local police to spend limited time and resources rounding up and detaining nonviolent immigrants who pose no threat. Forcing the District of Columbia to carry out the Federal Government's immigration duties also discourages residents from coming forward to share information with the police about violent crimes for fear that they or someone close to them will be detained or deported. This is simply bad policy and will hurt the residents of the District of Columbia. The House should reject H.R. 2056 and stop interfering in local D.C. matters. Instead, it should pass the District of Columbia Local Funds Act, and H.R. 51, Washington, D.C. Admission Act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"Have any alternative platforms been considered for the potential delivery of a tactical nuclear weapon? In particular, have the Government looked at the Astute class attack submarine as an alternative or additional platform, or at its successor, the SSN-AUKUS?"
"Mr. Speaker, I heard the parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister talk quite a bit about trade. One group of products being hit hard right now by tariffs is Canadian seafood. Lobster, of course, is a very important seafood export of the member's province and of mine as well. Since March, there has been a 25% tariff placed on Canadian seafood by China. It seems as though seafood and the seafood industry are just collateral damage in a trade war the member's government started with China. Given his high-profile position and how connected he is to the PMO, could the member explain to the fishing industry of Atlantic Canada if he is doing anything about it?"
I call the shadow Leader of the House.
"I have huge confidence in our force protection measures. I remind the hon. Gentleman that we have important military and intelligence assets in the region and bilateral defence relationships with Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt and, of course, Israel."
"Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking the Auditor General for her work. I would like to point out that we have taken action on all of her past recommendations, but we did not stop there. We terminated all contracts with GC Strategies over a year ago. We have revoked their security clearances. We have launched legal action against GC Strategies. We have referred cases to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Why? It is for the simple reason that we will always defend the integrity of our procurement system and hold bad suppliers and their contractors to account."
"I will come on to address that call, which I know is being made, but in general the Bill aims for, and I have always focused on, a win-win for development and the environment. We had extremely productive engagement with ENGOs in the development of the Bill, and we continue to have fruitful conversations with them, aside from the campaigns that I know are being fought out there in the country and in some of the national media. While critics of this part of the Bill may be content to maintain the suboptimal status quo, in full knowledge of the fact that it is frustrating the building of new homes and failing to drive the restoration of nature, this  Government are not. To those who believe this Government might buckle and scrap part 3 of the Bill entirely, I simply say, ""You have underestimated the resolve of this Government and this Minister."" The case for moving to a more strategic approach that will allow us to use funding from development to deliver environmental improvements at a scale that will have the greatest impact in driving the recovery of protected sites and species, is compelling. That is why so many organisations indicated their in-principle support for the purpose and intent of part 3 when the Bill was first introduced."
"Madam Speaker, [ Member spoke in indigenous language and provided the following text: ] Neegan ninaskomon Nohtwaynan anoch, Tansi Niwakakakanak, Maskekosihk Ochi Okimaw Natokipoi nitseekason. Representative Amiskwaciy waskigan Keewatinok paksimotahk. [ Member provided the following translation: ] First I acknowledge our creator and bring greetings to all my relations. My name is Sacred Rider Chief Billy Morin from Enoch Cree Nation, now the MP for Edmonton Northwest. [ English ] I have risen in this House before in short moments, so in this extended time allocation, please allow me to acknowledge those who helped me get here: my family, nikâwiy Charlene, nohtâwiy William, and all my extended family and community from the Enoch Cree Nation. I thank my roots in the Blackfoot territory, Kainai territory, Treaty 7 territory and southern Alberta and my Métis family. I thank my wife Felecia and our children, William, Wilton, Walker and Ashtrid, and my many grandparents, nimosumak and nokumak . Of course, I thank the good people of Edmonton Northwest, notably our grassroots campaign team. Edmonton Northwest is a place where people come. Since time immemorial, first peoples have gathered in Edmonton Northwest to live in Amiskwaciwâskahikan, or Beaver Hills House, the Cree name for the region. It was a place of peace; conflict and conflict resolution through treaty making; traditional ceremony; sustenance; and community. It was a place where the North Saskatchewan River flowed mightily and the buffalo and the game were plentiful. Right down the middle of my riding is the Anthony Henday highway. Anthony Henday is acknowledged as one of the first explorers to come to Edmonton. Over the next centuries since Anthony Henday, they still came. Many came from Europe to start, and in those early days, our collective ancestors made treaties nation to nation, which are upheld by the Canadian Constitution. These agreements are the basis for all peoples and Canadians to live in harmony for as long as the sun shines, the grass grows and the rivers flow, as written in treaty. In those early days, many came driven by hunger and hope. Those fleeing from persecution came. Those looking for a place they could build in came. Those looking for a place where hard work pays off came. Those looking for a place to build an income, a family and a living came. They came from all continents. Today, we have a huge population from the Middle East, the Philippines, eastern Asia, India, eastern Europe, Hispanic America, Africa, South America and more. People still come today in droves, with 60,000 per year over the last three years on average. Why do they come? Why have they been coming for hundreds of years? Why do they stay? Simply put, they come for affordability, opportunity, jobs, energy and safety. Edmonton's identity is built around this. All the big Canadian cities have their identities. I have been in conversations where some struggle to identify what Edmonton means and what Edmonton's identity is. To me, the most Edmonton thing that someone can do is work hard, buy a home, raise a family and become a part of the community. Having small-town roots in the big city is still a thing in Edmonton. However, this is under attack, and a root cause of this attack is the federal government's negligence. Homes are becoming increasingly more unaffordable, and this is not just a campaign talking point. I ran into many young people who, with humility, took time out of their day to tell me they could not afford a home. They said they had no way to have a family or grow their family. The number of young Canadians who see home ownership and starting a family as unaffordable and unattainable is growing in my riding. Grocery prices are rising, lineups at food banks are getting longer and energy to move a family around is becoming more expensive. High taxes for seniors are pricing them out of their own homes, the spaces that are intended for them to spend time with their grandkids. Despite powering this country for decades, our energy sector is villainized. The industrial heartland of Alberta and Canada is in my hometown of Edmonton, Alberta. Health care equality is systematically getting worse. Crime is out of control. The number of people struggling with addictions and mental health issues is worsening. Jobs for young people are getting scarce. As much as I acknowledge people coming to make a home in the traditional territory of my people in Edmonton Northwest, mismanaged immigration by the federal government is putting stress on all systems. I grew up a proud Canadian. I grew up singing the national anthem in my school on Enoch Cree Nation. I grew up knowing this country has the best potential in the world. Today, I have heard and empathize with Canadians who came here a generation ago wanting that same feeling of pride, knowing that if they followed the rules, worked hard and learned what it meant to be a Canadian, they too could live in that potential and hope. However, over the last decade, in what some have described as this country being a postnational state, somewhere pride among Canadians has waned. The government has made the mosaic of Canada a divider, not a unifier. It has pitted Canadian against Canadian. It has attacked the basic affordable family fundamentals for which everyone strives. Despite these attacks on the people in Edmonton and Edmonton Northwest, people still come. Why? It is because those who come to call that place home are resilient people. In my language we say âhkamêyimok , or “never give up”. We know despite the federal government's attacks on the west, the best is yet to come. We will always fight for the entrepreneurship of our home and the energy culture of the industrial heartland of Alberta, Canada and Edmonton. We will build upon educational institutions. Newcomers quickly learn, with the help of their fellow Edmontonians, how to handle the tough times in the cold and feeling left out. Edmonton still has the best potential for any city in this country. It can still be the freest city in the world. It can be a small town community with unity. Edmonton is still the city of champions, which is not just about sports success, but about how Edmontonians know how to work hard, know how to give back and know that they will always fight for safe communities and affordable homes. For thousands of years, my ancestors knew there was something special about the land. They knew there was something special about the water. They knew about the air and about the home that is Edmonton and Edmonton Northwest. Before coming to this House, I was given the task by my elders to continue to build bridges between all peoples. I was asked to share these values and to think win-win with all peoples on behalf of Edmonton Northwest. This revolves around the conversations and words spoken in this House today and during this Parliament about affordability. I am here to work on behalf of the people who put me here and to honour our past by investing in our future today, because I heard from them directly that buying a home, raising a family and contributing to community are the most Edmonton thing they can do—"
"Mr. Chair, that is an excellent question, and I hope that means the members opposite are going to vote for and support our one Canadian—"
"I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall and Camberwell Green (Florence Eshalomi), the Chair of the Select Committee, for securing the debate. It is such a relief that we now have a Government who acknowledge the scale of the housing challenge, and are prepared to put serious investment and policy change behind it. In my constituency, there are 3,000 families on the social housing waiting list, and more  than 2,000 people in temporary accommodation. It is those people I think of when we look at these numbers. There are no quick fixes, and we should be honest about that. However, the package in this spending review--the biggest investment in social and genuinely affordable homes for 50 years--is hugely welcome; there is the PS39 billion for the affordable homes programme, which has been mentioned, the 10-year rent deal, and the new low-interest loans. There is also something that I have been advocating for: equal access to the building safety fund for housing associations, so that money can go towards improving homes, not just remediating buildings. I strongly believe that the legacy of Grenfell cannot be that it is harder for people to get a safe and healthy home. I have been clear to the housing associations in my constituency that we expect radical improvements in their services--on repairs, on damp and mould, and on communications. My message to them was that this Government will get them the support that they need to get on a sounder financial footing, but that must be accompanied by a commitment to addressing those failings. We have kept our side of the bargain, so can the Minister outline his expectation that housing associations will invest in their homes following the spending review? Can he also give an update on opening up access to the building safety fund? On building safety, I hope that the Government will take seriously the need to support the Building Safety Regulator in doing its job effectively, and the need to avoid a false choice between building safety and achieving the 1.5 million homes target. The local government funding formula will have a major impact on our ability to secure safe and healthy homes. The consultation has just opened. I absolutely support the objective of tackling regional inequality in Britain, so I urge the Minister to ensure that any decisions made use accurate, up-to-date data that fairly reflects the reality."
"Mr. Speaker, we have watched corporate taxes decrease from 28% under the Mulroney government to 15% today. We have seen record profits in big groceries, an 8% increase, which is double that from pre-COVID. In terms of big oil and gas, there has been a $192-billion profit over the last four years, more than in the 2010s altogether. Is the minister considering increasing corporate taxes or an excess profit tax on the corporate greed?"
"Mr. Speaker, last week, the Prime Minister announced a $9.3-billion investment in Canada's defence, which means we will achieve NATO's 2% target this fiscal year. This is not only an investment in our armed forces, but also an investment in good-paying jobs, in Canadian innovation and in economic growth. Our generational investment is strengthening Canada's role as a strong, reliable international trading partner while rebuilding and rearming our forces here at home. It is unfortunate the Conservatives voted against it."
"We have run out of time. Resuming debate, the hon. member for Côte-Nord—Kawawachikamach—Nitassinan."
"My hon. Friend is right: we need to make sure that Thames Valley has the 68 additional neighbourhood police just this year and give them the powers they need. That is why we are strengthening the Crime and Policing Bill both on dangerous cycling and dangerous riding, and giving the police stronger powers to take e-scooters and off-road bikes literally off the roads."
"Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether my colleague, who is much more legally-minded than I am, will appreciate the parallel I am about to draw. He will have to let me know. I find this bill strangely reminiscent of the use of the Emergencies Act, which we voted on here. After letting a situation deteriorate, after doing nothing, the government is going to the other extreme. The government's reaction is disproportionate and oppressive, when it could have taken a proactive stance from the start, which would have prevented things from reaching this other extreme. Does that parallel make sense to my colleague?"
"Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his very interesting comment. As someone who lives in and represents a riding in British Columbia, I can say that we know that climate change is real. We understand the reality of the climate crisis. For me, the choice was clear in the last election. Canadians, and even Quebeckers, chose the vision that we presented, one where we can build a strong economy for the country while also building to address climate change. For us, the Liberals, it is important to do both. The Conservatives are only interested in creating an economy by taking a laissez-faire attitude to climate change. We Liberals are here to fight both battles at the same time. We are here to work for Canadians and Quebeckers."
The hon. member for Ponoka—Didsbury.
What discussions she has had with victims' groups on the early release of violent offenders
"Since becoming an MP, I have received thousands of pieces of casework from constituents who are stuck on social housing waiting lists. I recently had an email from a woman with severe mobility issues who is effectively trapped in her front room while she waits and waits for suitable social housing. Even when a home becomes available, she will be forced to compete with other residents because there simply are not enough affordable options. What will the recent new funding announced by the Government mean for my constituent and others like her who have already waited too long for a decent home?"
"Mr. Speaker, once again, I do not know how we can be much more clear. The Prime Minister convened the 13 provincial and territorial leaders today with the express purpose of discussing with them the kinds of major national nation-building projects that this country can consider undertaking. That is what is going on in Saskatoon. I do not know if the members across actually follow the news or followed the election campaign, but we said that it is time to build, and build is what we are going to do."
"Madam Speaker, as it has alway been, it is the Conservative Party's mandate to stand to support any positive step. Despite the fact that the tax cut the Liberals are talking about is so minimal, we will stand behind it."
"As an outer London borough, Havering has been hugely disadvantaged by a funding formula based on outdated population figures. We heard today that the Mayor of London himself is concerned that this Labour Government will level down London altogether. Will the Minister confirm that the fair funding review will report by this summer--I have been told that previously by a Minister--and will specifically address the disparities between inner and outer London?"
"Mr. Chair, home prices have skyrocketed, and that is why we need to be building affordable housing across Canada."
"I have listened to the Minister's statement and read the words, too, and nowhere can I see an explanation for why this decision has come now, 11 months after it was first announced. Why has this decision come now? Will we have to wait another 11 months for the Government to rethink their cuts to disability benefits?"
"Mr. Chair, the Liberals said that this was a priority for them. Can we see the registry before the summer vacation?"
"Madam Speaker, we know it was a unique election. Unless I am mistaken, it was not about the carbon tax, but more specifically about a certain president south of the border. I daresay that was the most influential factor because, as my colleague kindly noted, we put forward a lot of facts. As everyone knows, one of those facts is that the carbon tax does not apply in Quebec."
I will ask colleagues to remain on topic. I do provide some latitude. The hon. parliamentary secretary.
"I rise today to sound the alarm on the impending closure of the Quartz Hill Post Office and who knows how many other contract postal units across the country. On June 1, Stan Boylan, a veteran and the owner of the Quartz Hill Post Office, received a written termination notice informing him that his post office was scheduled to close. My family loves the Quartz Hill Post Office. My wife was devastated to hear this news. We are not alone. It has been a staple of our community for over 70 years and services tens of thousands of my constituents. I say we do not know the scale of closures because, even after I submitted an inquiry to the Acting Postmaster General, we have not yet been given a straight answer. What we do know is that the White House has been trying to absorb this historically independent agency and has given DOGE the green light to cut USPS staff and gut services. Let me be clear. The United States Postal Service does not use taxpayers dollars for operating costs. Reducing post office locations will lead to slower service, longer wait times, and delays in receiving packages, medications, and other necessary deliveries. I urge the Postmaster General to reverse the decision to terminate the Quartz Hill Post Office contract."
"For years, I have fought for a fairer distribution of SEND funding, and for years, I have got nowhere, as successive Governments--Labour and Conservative--have lacked the courage to rebalance the system. I hope Labour will not lack that courage again. I do not pretend to have all the answers to this problem, but I know that we must work out what fairness looks like and the minimum per-pupil cost required for SEND support, and commit to meeting that basic need, if not immediately, then at least over time. This Government need to be prepared to take from those above the baseline and give to those below. Would they be prepared to do that? No previous Government have been, but perhaps this one will. If not, we must find some other way. We could identify, through a mapping exercise, those who have been left behind, and we could say as a matter of principle that whenever there is an above-inflation increase in the Budget--such as the PS760 million that the Chancellor came up with in the spending review yesterday--it will always be used first and foremost to lift up those below the line, while doing nothing to cause a below-inflation increase for those who are above the line. Even if the Minister agrees with that idea, there will still be crisis management. How do we begin to tackle systemic inequality? Above all, it is vital that we revisit the high needs national funding formula, because it does not sufficiently account for regional cost differences, or for the genuine cost of delivering services in dispersed or under-served areas. The formula must reflect both complexity of need and the geography of the area in which that need arises. It needs to account for the added cost of providing services in rural areas. It is vital, too, that the formula moves away from the historical spend factor--the part of the formula that bases current funding on what a local authority spent on SEND provision in the 2018-19 financial year, and how it administratively described that spend. The formula means that a large section of funding is determined by pre-covid demand for SEND services, despite a post-pandemic spike. The Government have stated their intention to remove that factor, but progress has been painfully slow. Every year that we fail to act, we condemn another group of children with complex needs to struggling without the support that they deserve. The issue is not simply how much money is available; it is also how accessible and  responsive the system is. Families are forced into adversarial processes, schools are burdened with bureaucracy, and children are too often treated as numbers on a spreadsheet, rather than individuals with potential. We need a system that is focused on early intervention, not crisis management. I am here not simply to raise a problem, but to call for action. That action would ensure a fairer, more transparent funding formula that reflects real-world costs across the country, accounting for rurality and discounting historical spend. It would establish a clear baseline per-pupil cost for delivering effective SEND support, and ensure that every local authority was brought up to that level--if not quickly, then at least over time. It would create better accountability mechanisms, so that areas that are underperforming on delivering SEND provision can be supported and, where necessary, challenged. At the very least, I ask that the Government recognise the injustice of the system and the inequality that it produces. Those are not radical asks; they are practical, deliverable reforms that would make a meaningful difference for my constituents in Beverley and Holderness--and, I believe and hope, across the rest of the country. We have a duty as parliamentarians to ensure that every child, regardless of background, diagnosis, or postcode, has the support that they need to thrive. The disparities in SEND funding undermine that duty. If we believe in a truly inclusive education system, we cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the structural inequities built into the funding model. We owe it to our constituents, our schools and, most importantly, the children to fix this."
"On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I have given the Speaker's Office advance sight of this point of order on process, following proceedings last night in relation to new clause 82 tabled to the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which was not put for a separate decision. First, I want to say very clearly that this is no criticism or challenge of the decision of the Clerks, Deputy Chairs or Chairs, for whom I have immense respect, but it is a request for clarification on the process and the decision that was come to last night. With your indulgence, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to ask the following. New clause 82 was accepted for a separate decision yesterday, and it was signed by over 70 Members of Parliament. The Member who tabled the new clause, the hon. Member for Bournemouth East (Tom Hayes), had indicated outside the Chamber before the conclusion of the proceedings that he would not push the new clause to a vote, and that is his right. However, advice was given to the Chair that the Chair has discretion not to mention or put the Question at the conclusion of proceedings, despite the new clause being allocated for separate decision through the usual channels; thus, when the conclusion of proceedings came, there was no mention of new clause 82. Precedent in this House says that another Member who has signed the amendment can push the new clause to a vote. However, that option was not given to a Member who wished to do so and had signed the amendment. ""Erskine May"" states under paragraph 28.139, titled ""Conclusion of proceedings on consideration"": ""If the time available for debate on consideration under the terms of a programme order has been exhausted, Standing Order No 83E is engaged. In order to bring proceedings to a conclusion, the Speaker must put forthwith the following questions (but no others): a. any question already proposed from the Chair; b. any question necessary to bring to a decision a question so proposed; c. the question on any amendment, new clause or new schedule selected by the Speaker for separate decision; d. the question on any amendment moved or motion made by a Minister; and e. any other question necessary for the disposal of the business to be concluded."" Another example comes in Standing Order No. 32, which says in sub-clause (1): ""In respect of any motion or any bill under consideration on report or any Lords amendment to a bill, the Speaker shall have power to select the amendments, new clauses or new schedules to be proposed thereto."" Sub-clause (5) states: ""The powers conferred on the Speaker by this order shall not be exercised by the Deputy Speaker save during the consideration of the estimates."" I have a concern that this has set a precedent. Over 70 Members across the House who had signed a new clause did not have the chance to put it to a vote last night. The Member who tabled the clause spoke to it and outlined the measures that it would bring into the legislation. I am worried that Members from all parties across the House who have signed amendments and  new clauses will not have the opportunity to put them to a vote just because the Chair decides they have the discretion to eradicate that Question from being put in the proceedings of this House. I would be grateful for your clarification, Madam Deputy Speaker, and maybe you could offer a meeting with the Principal Clerk, so that I can discuss my concerns about this issue."
"The shadow Minister makes an important point. I know that the previous Government wrestled with this, and the current Government will too. It was not featured in our report, but I know my Front-Bench colleagues will listen and take it seriously. I thank him for raising that point."
"Mr. Speaker, I will agree with the member that yesterday was a big day. Project Outsource was a big win for Canada. It was a big win for Peel region. I want to thank the officers of Peel Regional Police, Halton, York, the RCMP and everyone who was involved in this investigation. When it comes to bail, the law says people who are a risk to public safety or of flight should not be given bail. It is important that the provinces, which administer justice, also make sure the criminal courts under the provincial jurisdiction function as they should."
"I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity not only to re-provide the existing Euston station--which, I am sure, will frustrate many Members and their constituents at times--but to provide the new HS2 station there and to unlock land around it. That will enable new homes to be delivered, but is also a massive commercial opportunity for regeneration in the heart of London. It is a very exciting opportunity--one that we will be saying more about in the coming weeks."
"Global tech giants such as Microsoft and Amazon have announced plans to use SMRs to power their data centres, so they have trust in SMRs. I happen to believe that they should be the future of nuclear in this country. I have a couple of questions for the Secretary of State. The announcement states that a new public company, GB Energy Nuclear, will be set up. Will he set out why a new company is required, how much it will cost the public purse, and why it is based in Warrington? I have nothing against Warrington, of course, but why has the decision been made to place the company there? Will he outline when he expects meaningful deployment of the modular reactors?"
"Mr. Chair, is the Assembly of First Nations a rights holder?"
"Lastly, the hon. Lady asked about hospital maintenance. There is a big commitment in the infrastructure strategy on maintenance. Maintenance is not sexy, and it is not good for election leaflets, but it is important. That is why we are committing so many billions today to it, because there is an enormous backlog. NISTA will be co-ordinating across Government and across all social infrastructure to make sure that we are  prioritising that going forward so that people can see quick, real, tangible improvements to their public infra- structure in their local communities."
I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.
The hon. member.
"My hon. Friend shares his experience of losing his father. I lost my father in the same way, and he too was a proud farming man. I want to raise an issue from a constituent who contacted me about her father James. He is currently alone in a room in a hospital, and he is scared to mix with other violent  dementia patients. He wants to be at home, and the family want him to be at home, but there are barriers in social care in Somerset at the moment. Does my hon. Friend agree that dementia patients should be able to live independently at home, with dignity, and receive the care--"
"The shadow Minister may not have listened closely to the statement on Monday, because that was confirmed by the Home Secretary. He may want to know that earlier this year, the Financial Times told us the reality of what went on inside the previous Government after Alexis Jay's report. The FT said that No. 10 urged Home Office Ministers to ""do more to 'engage with Alexis' and draw up a...plan for her recommendations."" One veteran admitted that ""The report came out at an unfortunate time and was maybe to some extent forgotten or deprioritised."" ""Forgotten or deprioritised""--yet now the Conservatives have the cheek to lecture this Government about the action we are taking to support and protect victims."
"There are 26 motions in amendment standing on the Notice Paper for the report stage of Bill C-5 . Motions Nos. 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12 to 14, 17, 20, 25 and 26 will not be selected by the Chair because they could have been presented in committee. All remaining motions have been examined and the Chair is satisfied they meet the guidelines expressed in the note to Standing Order 76.1(5), regarding the selections of motions and amendments at the report stage. Motions Nos. 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 16, 18, 19 and 21 to 24 will be grouped for debate and voted upon according to the voting pattern available at the table. I will now put Motions Nos. 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 16, 18, 19 and 21 to 24 to the House."
"I rise today in the middle of a whole lot going on, concerned about the reconciliation bill that will be considered in the Senate and what it means to the people of my State and in the country. But one of the ways that people find out what is going on here, whether they agree with us or not, is by watching us and listening to speeches. And one of the ways they do that is where? On C- SPAN. That is what I am here to talk about today because Senator Grassley and I have joined together on a resolution to celebrate the years that C-SPAN has been around in this Chamber. But it is also forward-looking in that we believe that we don't rest on our laurels in the Senate. We don't rest on our laurels with the work we do. C-SPAN doesn't rest on their laurels. And when I get to the end here, I will have a recommendation so that more people will have access to C-SPAN. So we are celebrating 39 years of C-SPAN's coverage of the Senate. And it is worth looking back at what was going on in 1986 when it all began. Prince had recently--a Minnesotan--released his eighth album; Ronald Reagan was President; and my colleague on this resolution, Chuck Grassley, was already in the Senate. While C-SPAN had begun airing floor activities over on the House side back in 1979, the Senate had been a tougher sell. It wasn't until someone introduced then-Senate Minority Leader Byrd as the ``Speaker of the House'' on a trip back home in West Virginia but gave him the wrong title--``Speaker of the House'' because people were watching C-SPAN in the House, and they had no access in the Senate--that then-Senator Byrd started to think, Hmm, maybe we should have TV coverage in the Senate as well to make sure that the Senate wasn't outshined by the House. The Senate voted, and C-SPAN2 was born 39 years ago today. According to Senator Leahy, Senators initially struggled with the lighting because they would see themselves on C-SPAN--especially one in particular that had, in Senator Leahy's words, a ``terrible toupee.'' He never let us know who that Senator was, but I guess that person had complained to him about the C-SPAN lighting. But Senators eventually came around to see this asset to our democracy for what it is: a way to shine sunlight on our work here in the Senate and to showcase the hard work of democracy to our constituents back at home. While much has changed with our technology since then, C-SPAN's commitment to offering uninterrupted, unfiltered access to our debates, votes, and deliberations in the Senate has not. C-SPAN2 has recorded more than 43,000 hours of Senate sessions, capturing more than 169,000 speeches. These recordings preserve the voices of 359 different Senators, including 185 Republicans, 167 Democrats, and 7 Independents across nearly four decades of service. These hours include memorable moments like Senator Ted Kennedy's speech in July 1987; then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and then- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's fireside chat about baseball in 2010; the first time Senator Duckworth brought her baby to the floor after Senator Blunt and I worked to change the rules to allow parents to bring brandnew infants to the floor; Senator Booker's recent 24-hour recordbreaking floor speech; and debates on key legislation. C-SPAN brought this work directly into our constituents' living rooms, as it has done for every monumental development in the Senate for the past 39 years. C-SPAN2 has also documented nearly 24,000 rollcall votes, providing the transparency and accountability our democracy needs to thrive. That is why, on its 39th birthday, Senator Grassley and I wanted to highlight how important it is for all television providers, including major streaming services like YouTube TV, owned by Google, and Hulu + Live TV, owned by Disney, to provide the American public with C-SPAN and the opportunity to see their government work on the Senate floor. If you look at these packages with these channels, you will see so many channels, as all of us know, so many offered, but somehow omitted from those channels of YouTube, Google, and Hulu + Live TV is C-SPAN, which would allow the people of this country, for no cost, to be able to see the deliberations that go on in the House and the Senate. Access to this live coverage on all platforms, being able to see hearings, congressional hearings, being able to see what we say is so important for the American people. So we got used to this 39 years ago when only the House had it and the Senate thought it was too cool to do. No, no, this is our Chamber. We are not going to let any TV cameras in. We let those TV cameras in. Well, now we are at a different stage in our history, and a lot of people are seeing their news this way. So we need to expand it and make sure we are on all of those platforms, as well as the ones we already are on. Thank you again to Senator Grassley for working with me to highlight C-SPAN's critical role, and thanks to everyone who has had a hand in C- SPAN's success. Happy birthday."
"Mr. Speaker, this week, the Auditor General released a scathing report on ArriveCAN's main contractor, GC Strategies. This two-person company, which is now under investigation by the RCMP, received a staggering $64 million. The worst part is that we do not even know if it did any work. The Conservatives have introduced a motion to ban this company for life. Will all members of the House vote to ensure that Canadian taxpayers get their money back?"
"Mr. Speaker, I think the Prime Minister has made it clear there will be only a few named projects that will be fast-tracked. The remainder of the projects will be under the scrutiny of the process we have followed in the past, so there will be a lot of time for feedback and discussion on anything that is going to affect the environment."
"Baroness Casey was impressed by the work that West Yorkshire police had done using what it called the Smith algorithm; it is included in her report. It looks at risk factors, such as children missing from home or school, those with repeated missing episodes, and children in care, and at areas where risks were high. It uses that to identify people who might be victims of child grooming and sexual abuse and exploitation, and then to pursue that evidence. West Yorkshire police has had a series of effective and successful prosecutions that have put perpetrators behind bars, so I join my hon. Friend in welcoming that work."
"Mr. Speaker, we have talked about strengthening accountability, and I think that is what is happening. Government should be in a role of constant improvement, and strengthening accountability is something that we are doing. We are strengthening the oversight, which has already happened, and we are clarifying responsibilities, which is a big part of that, by taking legal action against GC Strategies, going after the money it has, revoking its security clearance and also referring the case to the RCMP. I know more work needs to be done, but I believe we are taking those necessary steps, and we will continue to do so."
"Madam Speaker, the hon. member spoke about slogans, and I reflect on the slogans used by the Prime Minister . One of the most absurd is his slogan to “spend less and invest more”. He is supposed to be the man with the plan, but he is the man with no budget who says that the Liberals are going to spend less but invest more, which means they are going to spend even more. We see in the Liberals' spending that they are spending even more than Justin Trudeau planned. Canadians wanted change, but they did not want change in the direction of bigger government, more regulation, more waste, more spending and higher unemployment, and today we are seeing the effects of the Prime Minister 's slogans and lack of a plan: higher unemployment across the board. If the government has a plan, why does it not present it? Why does it not present a budget? If it has a plan, why can we not see it?"
"Mr. Chair, do you think a seven-year ban is acceptable for a company that defrauded Canadians of $64 million, or do you think that the time should be longer?"
"It is a real pleasure to take part in this debate on product regulation and metrology, not least because it gives me the opportunity to highlight the work done by my former colleagues at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, which is the UK's home of metrology. I would like to set the mind of the hon. Member for Erewash (Adam Thompson) at rest. He is still, as far as I know, the only metrologist with whom I have worked in a finance department, but, nevertheless, as a non-scientist, it gave me a real admiration for the work of scientists in this particular area. In Teddington they are setting the standards. They are developing and maintaining the primary measurement standards for the UK and across the world. What I would like to say to the Chamber this afternoon and to my constituents in the neighbouring constituency of Richmond Park is that if they have been inspired by the hon. Member for Erewash and have had a fire ignited in them for the science of metrology, the National Physical Laboratory is having its open day this Friday, 6 June, and everyone should go along."
"Mr. Chair, yes, it is second to Alberta. Does the minister know the annual royalties of Newfoundland offshore oil and gas?"
Will the Minister give way?
"Third sector organisations like LandWorks deliver valuable rehabilitation, wellbeing support and advocacy services across England and Wales, and they partner effectively with HMPPS in many different ways. The work of key organisations like the one the hon. Member mentions is incredibly important and essential in reducing reoffending, and we continue to invest in it. I would be happy to meet her to discuss the matter further and see what more can be done."
"Madam Speaker, today, my colleague opposite has a golden opportunity to vote for a bill that will lower the cost of living for Canadians. Will he and his party support us today?"
"I commend the Government on the prompt procurement of the F-35A fixed-wing, which is of huge strategic importance, but this is already creating great uncertainty in Lancashire--in Chorley, Mr Speaker, and in my constituency of South Ribble--where the workforce of the Typhoon Eurofighter live. Can the Minister please assure me that the Government will still be constant in looking to procure the Typhoon aircraft for the RAF? Also, with our NATO partners all increasing their defence spending, is there not a huge opportunity to urge them to procure the Typhoon Eurofighter as well?"
"The Minister is quite right--not that I ever exercised those powers. But as I said, in my view the Supreme Court has corrected an anomaly that the previous Government took advantage of. Yes, absolutely, hands up, they did--I am not saying that is correct. He is proposing that in the face of a Supreme Court decision that he does not like, he will change the law to say that the court was in effect wrong and that the fundamental right on which the Supreme Court has decided--we should not forget that the courts basically decide our rights within the legal framework--is somehow not to be tolerated."
"Mr. Speaker, let us be clear here. This is not about punishing Canadians born abroad. It is about respecting the meaning of Canadian citizenship. My constituents in Richmond Hill South did not get citizenship handed to them by bloodline. They earned it. They waited. They worked. They sacrificed. All we are saying is, if someone wants citizenship, they should show the same commitment. The bill erases that standard and replaces it with a bloodline test. That is not fairness. It is privilege. Conservatives believe in equal opportunity, not automatic entitlements."
moved: That Bill C-5 be amended by deleting Clause 4.
"Mr. Speaker, does the minister see the government's taxation revenue growing by 10% per year?"
"Enforcement of the law is the best way to deal with this issue, which is why there has been a 40% increase in visits to check whether illegal working is going on, and a 42% increase in arrests since this Government came to office."
"Mr. Chair, Japan has signed a long-term agreement for LNG with the United States, our number one competitor. What would the value of that have been to Canadian taxpayers and revenue to the federal government had that agreement been signed with Canada?"
"I call the Chair of the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee."
What discussions she has had with the Sentencing Council on sentencing guidelines for immigration offences.
"I rise today in support of my bipartisan bill, the Baby Changing on Board Act. This is a simple, commonsense bill, and it is long overdue. Every parent deserves the basic dignity of a clean, safe space to change their baby's diaper, no matter how they travel. Right now, many long-distance trains can go for hours without a single stop. Families riding Amtrak shouldn't have to change their babies on the floor of a train car or in unsafe, unsanitary conditions. It is simply unacceptable, and it is avoidable. Mr. Speaker, my bill ensures that every new Amtrak train includes a baby-changing table in at least one restroom per car, including ADA- compliant restrooms, because, let's be real, babies don't wait for layovers when they need to be changed. Mr. Speaker, I will paint the picture: You are holding your baby in one arm, a diaper bag in the other, and probably some other stuff, too. You make your way to the restroom with your kids and your bags, only to realize there is no changing table. What are you supposed to do? This is not a hypothetical. Millions of Americans ride Amtrak every year, so those trains should work for everyone, including families with young kids. Yet, on many of those trains, parents, usually moms, are forced to make an impossible choice: change their child on a dirty floor or seat, or just sit there and hope for the best. Mr. Speaker, I have heard from families and parents in my northern Illinois community who rely on Amtrak, and they are tired of getting stuck in this impossible position on trains that don't have safe facilities for the littlest riders. Since this is a safety issue for these children, it is a public health issue. Frankly, it is about dignity. These parents aren't asking for luxury. They are asking for a clean, flat surface and some basic respect. Mr. Speaker, we all know diaper changes are not optional, which is why safe baby-changing stations shouldn't be optional, either. The Baby Changing on Board Act is about building a country where every family has what they need to thrive. That starts with recognizing that caregiving matters, parenting matters, and infrastructure should actually support it. This bill will not solve every challenge that parents face, but it is a meaningful step toward a more family-friendly future. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their support of this bill. In particular, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Van Drew) for working to introduce it with me. I urge everyone in this Chamber to vote ``yes.'' Let's make changing a diaper on a train a little less gross and a lot more humane."
"The shadow Minister's memory is different from mine: I did provide those assurances. We have already allocated PS14 million in the Budget to support the delivery of the nature restoration fund, and through measures set out in the Bill, we will move to a system of full cost recovery so that Natural England has the resources it needs to carry out those functions."
"I rise today to honor Steven ``Chaos'' Camou, a vibrant soul from Blythe, California, whose life reminds us of the urgent need for compassion in mental health care. Steven was a talented hairdresser with a bright personality and deep love for his mother, Angela Colangeli. He faced incredible challenges: addiction, stigma around his queer identity, and schizophrenia, yet he fought to find peace, often without the professional help he needed. On October 27, 2021, Steven tragically took his own life, but even in his darkest moments, he dreamed of helping others not to feel alone in their struggles. In his memory, his mother and his father, George, founded Peace from Chaos, a nonprofit supporting those living with mental illness, addiction, and social rejection. As Men's Mental Health Awareness Month comes to an end, let's honor Steven by fighting for a world where no one suffers in silence, and everyone has access to care, support, and dignity."
"Mr. Speaker, this government was selected by Canadians to deliver. We are cutting taxes for 22 million Canadians. We are permanently cutting the carbon tax. We are cutting taxes for first-time homebuyers. Our focus is on building the strongest economy in the G7. I ask the party and the members opposite to join us and get on board."
"A local charity in my area supports women veterans. Recently, it was supporting a woman who was rehomed in general-purpose supported accommodation for veterans in Scotland. The accommodation was entirely unsuitable for her as a survivor of sexual violence, and it led to her being subjected to a further sexual assault by a man who was also housed there. Can the Minister assure me that her work with the Ministry of Defence will ensure appropriate support for women veterans?"
"My hon. Friend will have seen the statement we made yesterday and the actions that we are taking with allies. The humanitarian situation is dreadful and distressing, and the scenes that we have witnessed outside aid distribution centres are frankly heartbreaking. More aid into Gaza is needed at volume and speed, and Israel's plan for aid delivery is inadequate and insufficient. What is needed is for the UN and other agencies to deliver that aid according to well-established mechanisms, and Israel must allow this. We are working with allies to do all that we can to make this happen, as well as to get the hostages out--they have been held for a very long time--and a desperately needed return to a ceasefire."

"Mr. Chair, why were they not disqualified for life?"
"Mr. Chair, on a point of order, I think if we could allow the minister to actually have the answer, maybe they could get an answer."
"in this Puerto Rican and Immigrant Heritage Month, I rise to recognize one of Chicago's own, Justina Machado, a celebrated actress and proud ``daughter,'' ``hija'' of Chicago's northwest side. Raised in a working-class Puerto Rican family, Ms. Machado's journey from Lane Tech High School, which is also in my district, to the Broadway stage and Hollywood screens is a testament to her talent, her perseverance, and her deep cultural roots. From her roles in HBO's ``Six Feet Under'' to Netflix' ``One Day at a Time,'' and now the Tony-nominated Broadway adaptation of ``Real Women Have Curves,'' Justina has beautifully played characters with immigrant backgrounds. Through her talent, she has brought visibility, dignity, and complexity to the lives of Latinos and immigrant families who are too often overlooked. Her performances speak not only to where she has been but to who we are. We are resilient, we are proud, and full of possibility. On behalf of Illinois' Third Congressional District, I commend Justina Machado for using her voice and artistry to uplift our stories and communities with grace, humor, and truth. Gracias and congratulations to Justina."
"Mr. Speaker, today the Auditor General released a scathing audit on the top arrive scam fraudster, GC Strategies. This two-person, basement-dwelling company feasted on 64 million taxpayer dollars. This was a direct gift from the Liberal government, which allowed basic procurement rules to be completely ignored over the last 10 years. Canadians still do not know who did the work, what was done, if they were qualified or if they had security clearances. This is complete government incompetence. The ask is simple: When will taxpayers get their money back?"
"First of all, I welcome the fact that, at least in real terms, the Northern Ireland budget has been maintained over the spending period, although I would point out to the Chancellor that a 0.5% real increase will not enable the Northern Ireland Executive to match the real increase in spending on health and policing which will be taking place in the rest of the United Kingdom. May I emphasise again the preference that she has given in this budget to money for a Gaelic Athletic Association ground? In blundering into this issue, she has given the Executive a massive financial headache. She requires PS50 million to be matched by funding elsewhere. The Executive will be required to find about  PS200 million to make up the deficit, raising expectations and, I believe, creating tension within the Executive as a result. I think it was wrong for her to try to interfere in the minutiae of spending of the Executive in that way. As a general point, maybe in the autumn many people who welcome the headlines today will be regretting the tax increases they will face to pay for the announcements today."
"Mr. Speaker, the City of Windsor is still owed $1 million from the convoy issues that went on there. The Liberal government has not paid it. Some of the money that would be recovered from this enterprise would go to the City of Windsor to refill its coffers, because this is money it has already spent."
Will the hon. Member give way?
"Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister yesterday announced his new chief of staff and principal secretary. These are two of the top officials, some of the most powerful people in Ottawa, directing policy. The new chief of staff wants to kill oil and gas and says it needs to be done through Brookfield. David Lametti, who was Trudeau's justice minister, oversaw our broken bail system and kept Bill C-5 's and Bill C-75 's laws on the books. Why is the Prime Minister surrounding himself with former Trudeau officials who want to keep oil and gas in the ground and keep soft-on-crime laws on the books?"
"I commend the hon. Lady for bringing this debate forward. I spoke to her before the debate and her concerns are those of us all, and that is why we are here--to try to make lives better. Across England, Wales and Northern Ireland breast screening coverage remained relatively steady over time until 2019, at an average of 76%, but following covid in 2019, breast screening coverage had decreased to 65% by 2022. The covid impact on breast screening is entirely worrying, as is the fact that most trusts are not back to pre-covid screen test rates. Does the hon. Lady agree that we need a co-ordinated approach throughout the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to enhance screening rates? We look forward to hearing the Minister's response."
I give my hon. Friend 10 out of 10 for ingenuity. I have heard so many references to horses during the passage of the Bill that at times I felt I was at the Aintree racecourse. We can be clear that the Bill will not lead to dynamic alignment by default.
"I must say that the shadow Minister is developing a bit of a habit here; he seems to have conflated a number of separate issues. The Government have a very clear commitment to ending the feudal leasehold system within this Parliament. That requires a wider set of reforms than switching on the powers that are already on the statute book via the 2024 Act, though we are going to do that and are doing so at pace. If he cared to look at the written ministerial statement where I set all this out in a lot of detail, he would see that we remain on track with implementing our reform agenda."
"Mr. Chair, I want to highlight one aspect that my colleague raised, and that is the importance of the north and the importance of Arctic sovereignty. I had the privilege today of meeting with the Premier of the Northwest Territories and with two chiefs from the Northwest Territories. Their enthusiasm for building Canada, for building up our sovereignty in the north, was absolutely infectious. There is a lot of excitement right now around projects like the Arctic security corridor, including the Grays Bay road and port project. We need to all join together to get these projects built. I do hope all members of this House will share that enthusiasm that we can feel in the country for rolling up our sleeves and building Canada."
"My hon. Friend gives us a great advert for all that is going on in her constituency. These sorts of events are important for attracting visitors and tourists to her constituency, Yorkshire and beyond."
"I welcome a lot of what the Home Secretary has said today; she keeps referring to institutional failures. In Bradford in 2020, a little girl, Star Hobson, was murdered by her mother's partner. Evidence came to light from neighbours and social services that the case was dismissed because it involved a lesbian couple and people feared being accused of being homophobic. I have also had issues in my constituency since the last election where social workers have been worried about the other labels that they may get; they have a tick box and leave the child at the bottom. I ask the Home Secretary to consider that institutional failure where people are afraid to offend one group or another, and they often lose sight of the fact that the child is the most important part of the care service."
"The hon. Gentleman tempts me to talk about the Dawlish scheme. I must admit that it is a topic I will need to take up with the Rail Minister, and I will be happy to give the hon. Gentleman a response in writing in respect of the merits of the scheme."
"I very much welcome that question. The Ministry of Defence has been a partner in the defence industrial strategy, which mirrors and is closely aligned with, as one would expect, the strategic defence review and the big increase in spending under this Government."
"My hon. Friend mentions the USA committing to a road map. I believe the EU has also done so, and is looking to phase out animal testing entirely through its road map, which is due to be published in 2026. Does she agree that the UK Government could commit to something similar--a road map that gives activists and others confidence in our direction of travel?"
"Mr. Chair, yes, we do."
"Mr. Speaker, last year, after an independent process, the government suspended the company for this year. It is finished."
"Under the old guard of the Conservatives, families had to earn less than PS7,400, often in low-paid and insecure work, to qualify for free school meals. Under this Labour Government, thousands more children in Wolverhampton North East and 500,000 more across the country will benefit from free school meals. Will the Deputy Prime Minister outline how Labour's plans will put more money in parents' pockets?"
"As I have said for a long time, taxpayers in this country should not be subsidising tax breaks for private schools. I welcome all schools that give children a great education, but I am also determined to ensure we have qualified teachers in every classroom, for every child, which is something the hon. Gentleman's Government failed to do."
"Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to be here speaking on behalf of the people of Markham—Unionville. Today, we are discussing a bill framed around creating strong borders, yet somehow, it does so much more and so much less than its stated goal. We have a 140-page border bill that somehow also pushes for warrantless access to information about Internet subscribers. If this is the case, the Liberals are pushing for an expansive definition of strong borders. However, in earlier questions about the bill, when we, the official opposition, critiqued elements that could be added to it, our efforts were denied because the Liberals cited a narrow definition of this being merely a borders bill. Which is it? A borders bill that has extensive unlawful access provisions is clearly a bill that can include more real community safety elements, so let us touch on that. To Conservatives, strong borders mean being tough on drugs across the entire supply chain. This includes drug production, not just drug trafficking. This includes drug producers, not just drug traffickers. In short, it is not just about the substances, but about the actors who are involved. When we are talking about actors, we need real consequences for the perpetrators of these acts of social destruction. We need mandatory minimum sentences, not bail, when the issue is about fentanyl. How can a borders bill request warrantless access to Internet subscriber information and not also have strong measures against the fentanyl problem? An expansive definition of a strong border requires a holistic tackling of the fentanyl supply chain. Unfortunately, even if Bill C-2 passes, Canadians will still be left with the unsafe society that the Liberals legislated into being. We live in a society where fentanyl traffickers have no mandatory minimums and can receive bail and where house arrest is considered a worthy punishment for the monsters who are killing our community. Conservatives will keep repeating this one simple fact until the Liberals hear us: It takes only two milligrams of fentanyl to kill a fellow Canadian. If members understand this simple fact, anyone trafficking over 40 milligrams of fentanyl should be considered no different than a mass murderer who guns down 20 people. However, the Liberals want these people to walk free on bail and have a comfortable time under house arrest. They will not punish people on the same level as mass murders, yet they have the audacity to want warrantless access to our Internet information in their borders bill. Are we truly talking about a borders bill? To Conservatives, a strong border means being tough on crime in order to secure the safety of our hard-working communities. From 2015 through 2023, total violent crime was up 50%, total homicides were up 28%, gang-related homicides were up about 78% and total violent firearms offences were up about 116%, which has increased for nine consecutive years. Just as with fentanyl traffickers, we want to see a similar approach for firearms traffickers and the gun-wielding gangsters they serve. We want mandatory minimums, we want an end to bail for these particular offences and we want an end to house arrest. However, we live in a world where the Liberals have legislated an easy time for repeat offenders while launching a crusade against legal gun owners. I have established what the bill does not have but should. Let me now outline what is has but probably should not. The strong borders bill apparently finds the need to encroach upon norms we hold dear for our civil liberties. We are deeply concerned that the bill would grant people the ability to open our mail without our consent. We are deeply concerned that the bill would compel Internet companies to hand over our private data without our consent. We are further concerned that the bill even attempts to interfere in how Canadians use cash. Do the Liberals wish for a 100% digital economy? A world where the Liberals can encroach upon cash transactions and, further, have the ability to access our private digital information leads to a world where they will eventually have complete oversight over our transactions. Is this necessary for a strong borders bill? Does this make us true north strong and free? No, it never can. The bill would curtail the freedoms of hard-working Canadians while letting repeat criminals walk free on bail. This is madness made legal. If Bill C-2 is going to be a narrowly defined borders bill that has no room to address our drug and gun issues, it is definitely a bill that has no room for warrantless access to our mail and Internet data while limiting our capacity to use cash. However, because it is clearly a bill with an expansive definition of what constitutes a strong border, we Conservatives have some recommendations that require inclusion. We have four points that merit consideration. One, a strong border means toughening penalties for repeat violent offenders. Two, a strong border means ending catch-and-release bail and house arrest for fentanyl traffickers and gun gangsters. Three, a strong border means eliminating the multiple murder discount in sentencing. Four, a strong border means tackling drug issues holistically, prioritizing treatment over drug distribution to support those battling addiction. What we need is a strong borders bill that will take public safety seriously while also protecting Canadian freedoms. What we have instead is a bill that does not address the core problems on the drug and crime files while completely disrespecting the freedoms that Canadians hold dear. Bill C-2 is an omnibus bill that falls well short of protecting Canadians while overreaching on our civil liberties."
"The Minister may have seen my constituent Mollie Mulheron recently featured on ""Newsnight"". Our local ICB recently refused her access to fertility treatment after recovery from an aggressive cancer with a high likelihood that her illness  will return. Will the Minister meet me and Mollie to discuss that issue, and access to fertility treatment for cancer survivors and patients?"
"Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his trick question. I can say that I love the people of Rosemont—La Petite‑Patrie, and I can assure my colleague that I will be here as a left-leaning politician to defend socialist values, fairness, social justice and equality. The people of Rosemont—La Petite‑Patrie, Montreal and Quebec will always be able to count on me and my NDP colleagues to defend workers and to make the world a better place, where everyone belongs and where everyone is able to have a good job and a good retirement with rights. We will do that together, regardless of how many Liberals or Conservatives there are here in the House. We are here to fight, we are here for the people, and we will continue to do the work."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Calgary East for his inspiring speech. As a business owner, he understands the importance of budgeting and tracking expenses to know how to direct a company. Why did I choose to rise in the House today? The reason is that the Prime Minister and his minority government—let us not forget—are refusing to comply with the demand of the majority of the House and table a budget in the spring. I would like to remind the government of this. Out of respect for the institution of the House of Commons, out of respect for Canadians, who budget, but who unfortunately are struggling to make ends meet after 10 years of an inflationary Liberal government, out of respect for our children who are currently learning abut the importance of budgeting at school and out of respect for all business owners who budget in order to be good managers, I want to say, loud and clear, this morning that it is important that the government table a budget this spring, not in the fall. The Liberals will go a year without a budget. They will manage our country without tabling a budget. It is unbelievable. What a lack of rigour. The government announced half a trillion dollars in spending without tabling a budget. To top it all off, the Prime Minister made the King read a promise in the throne speech about how the government would cap spending at 2%, but then two hours later, the government introduced a bill to increase spending by 8%. The Liberals themselves showed Justin Trudeau the door because he was not a good manager. With the arrival of Donald Trump's tariffs, the good Canadian banker appeared like a saviour. He said ""elbows up"" when it comes to the Americans, while promising to impose dollar-for-dollar tariffs. He anticipated $20 billion in revenues to be redistributed to those affected by the tariffs. Apparently, the banker is also a magician. He made the retaliatory tariffs disappear, and we lost the $20 billion in revenues he promised in his election platform. When the Liberals came to power, the debt stood at $700 billion. After 10 years of Liberal governance, the debt now stands at $1.4 trillion. We thought it was impossible to have a prime minister who spends more than Justin Trudeau, but the Liberals have managed to find one who spends far more. Interest on the debt will amount to $49 billion, or 10% of the total budget. That is more than the government transfers to the provinces for health care. This is unsustainable. The Parliamentary Budget Officer predicts that interest on the debt will reach $70 billion in 2030. I did a little research: In 2014‑15, Quebec's former finance minister, the current federal MP for the riding of Marc-Aurèle-Fortin , took 42 days to present a budget. He said this: “The government is giving itself the means to achieve its objectives and return to a balanced budget.... This is not an obsession. It is an obligation.” The current federal member of Parliament said that in 2014‑15. I invite the Prime Minister to have a good talk with his MP about how to achieve ambitious budget targets. What are the consequences of Liberal mismanagement? It creates inflation. A family of four is expected to see their annual grocery bill increase by $800. Currently, nearly a quarter of the country's population is experiencing food insecurity. In 2024, food banks marked another unfortunate milestone when Canadians made two million monthly visits. That is double the number of visits just five years ago. For 18% of people who use food banks, employment is their main source of income. That means that one in five users is working and still relies on a food bank. That is the reality. One of these two million is my friend and former high school classmate François. François works and sticks to a budget, but he still cannot make ends meet. He goes to a food bank, which is where I ran into him. A former employee heard me speak in the House and wrote me last week to tell me that she lives alone and that she is having a very hard time making ends meet. She has to pay rent, make payments, pay bills, and then eat if there is any money left over. Imagine talking about eating if there is any money left over. That is the reality. I was a municipal councillor for seven years, during which I never heard anyone talk about homelessness in Victoriaville. Over the past 10 years, it has become a major issue. Kids are going to school with empty lunch boxes. Some of them have not had breakfast before going to school. We are lucky because we have organizations in our ridings that are there to help them. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the organizations that provide food aid to our constituents. What does the Prime Minister have to say to Canadians as the price of food continues to skyrocket? Beef is up over 30%; oranges are up 26%; apples are up 18%; rice is up 14%; coffee is up 9%; and infant formula is up 9%. In conclusion, I have to admit that I am worried. I am worried about the Liberal government blindly and irresponsibly managing the country we are so proud of without a budget. I am worried because young people are being asked to dream and bring about the prosperous future they dream of. That is what they are being asked to do, but this government has been managing the country without a budget for a year now. What I have seen since arriving here is a government that is bringing in half a trillion dollars in new spending without a budget. That is irresponsible. As the opposition, we will do everything in our power to ensure that the government responds to the demand of the majority of the House. Let me remind members that this is a minority government. The majority of the House has asked that a budget be tabled this spring. We are going to keep a careful watch on this government. We are going to be there to stand up for Canadians and to ensure that this government is finally a responsible government."
"Mr. Chair, the CTA planned to spend $22.5 million in 2023 but spent $38.5 million. Is it the opinion of the minister that this is proper financial management, yes or no?"
"Madam Chair, it should not."
"Final two questions and answers--very short, please."
"The right hon. Lady is setting out very clearly what the Bill is intended to be, and has rightly pointed to the cross-party support for the main thrust of it. Does she agree that that unanimity of purpose is put in grave jeopardy by the Christmas tree-ing of significant amendments relating to abortion? I know that she had a personal interest in this issue in opposition. These very dramatic changes to abortion law require a much fuller debate in this place than can be had on an amendment to a Bill that has the purpose that the right hon. Lady has set out. The Government never intended the Bill to be a Christmas tree Bill, but it has become one. The House runs the risk of fracturing its unanimity of purpose if those amendments are pressed to a vote and become part of the legislation."
"Madam Speaker, there is no trickery here, just a new Prime Minister and a new government. The new Prime Minister indicated that we would get rid of the carbon tax. It made sense that we would not cancel the rebate 28 days later, when Canadians had been incorporating those rebates as part of their budget. I am amazed the Bloc members are not thinking of those individuals, in particular the seniors who were dependent on it, individuals on fixed incomes and many others. For the member to say that it has anything to do with any form of trickery, I think, is disingenuous. It would have been cruel for the Prime Minister to not move forward with those rebates. The question I would ask the member is, does he not recognize the value of the rebate cheques that were anticipated in April?"
"Madam Speaker, the hon. member has been very instrumental in reviewing this piece of legislation, and I absolutely agree with his observations. We have heard more stories like the one he just cited for us in this place. The government needs to ensure that the legislation is going to be robust, and, as opposition, we are going to do the same in addressing the concerns that he just cited."
"Yes. I have long been a supporter of the BBC World Service. My hon. Friend's question chimes with other questions about the soft power of  this country. We have incredible soft power and incredible strength in our diplomacy, and that very often achieves results in a way that then makes it less necessary to use the hard power."
"When I visited my Ukrainian Saturday school in Welwyn Garden City, many of the parents impressed on me the importance of having the option for Ukrainian children to study a GCSE in the Ukrainian language. As it stands, somebody can study Russian, but not Ukrainian, and I have promised to take up the cause. I have written to all the national exam boards, with some mixed responses, but I am determined to stay on the case. Does the Leader of the House agree that that would be a fantastic subject for further debate in this place?"
"moved for leave to introduce Bill C-207, An Act to amend the Canada Pension Plan . Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be tabling my legislation, an act to amend the Canada Pension Plan. I am very grateful to the member for Vancouver Kingsway for seconding my bill. The bill would strengthen the Canada Pension Plan act and give the millions of Canadians who contribute to and receive benefits from the CPP a say in the future of their CPP. It would protect the CPP from politicians who would gamble with their retirement security. Canadians need and deserve financial security in retirement, and the Canada Pension Plan is a critical component of that financial security, but the CPP is at risk from Conservatives. Danielle Smith's United Conservatives in Alberta have passed legislation that would authorize the province to withdraw Alberta from the Canada Pension Plan. While Albertans are very worried about their CPP and losing their access to CPP, the implications of Smith's plan go well beyond Alberta. Alberta's withdrawal from the CPP could harm millions of Canadians outside Alberta who rely on the CPP now and will rely on it into the future. The bill would change the CPP act to require approval of at least two-thirds of the provinces currently participating in the CPP, ensuring that Canadians impacted by the decision would have a say in the future of their pension plan. New Democrats are committed to protecting retirement benefits for Albertans and for all Canadians, today and into the future. I hope all members will support my bill. (Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed)"
"There have been many references to the housing crisis and impassioned speeches, which I have welcomed. Like every other constituency in London, we have a housing crisis on a scale not seen before, and it has largely been caused by council houses being sold off and not replaced. What has happened in my area is a salutary lesson about infrastructure developments. Crossrail is going through and the Elizabeth line has now gone through, so land value prices have gone through the roof. In central Hayes, I have more than 4,500 properties being built. We have no lack of planning permissions--in fact,  we have planning permissions coming out of our ears--but most local people cannot even think of affording what is being built. Many have tried to become leaseholders, and now they are being hit by huge increases in service charges, and some cannot even sell on their properties as a result. With new clause 49, which no one has mentioned so far, we are asking the Government to look at how we can capture land value. There is a discussion to be had about a land value tax, and I think its time is coming. Many of those 4,500 properties are described as affordable, but they are not affordable to local people. That is why new clause 67 is so important, because we do not want affordable properties; we want social rent properties. In fact, I would like simply to give our local authorities the resources and to let them start building again, so that we can have places of a decent standard with a rent that people can afford. Some 45 years ago, I was on the Greater London Council's planning committee, and I was chair of finance, too. By the way, we should have some confidence in local government being able to undertake infrastructure projects, because were it not for the GLC--and me as well, actually--building the Thames barrier, most Members here would be swimming. That shows what local government can do. We decry local government too often. I dealt with developers throughout that process, and I can say that I have dealt with some good developers and also some atrocious ones. Often they do not deliver, and often they do let us down, and that is why new clause 69 is so important. It merely asks for measures to be put in place during the planning process before a development is properly allowed to go ahead: in other words, the mitigation is there. Deals have been done in my constituency, such as section 106 deals, that have not really stood up, and the developers have walked away leaving us to clear up the mess. New clause 74, tabled by the hon. Member for South Leicestershire (Alberto Costa)--who is not in the Chamber at present--draws attention to a classic example of what almost constitutes betrayal on the part of developers who come along, develop the site, take the profits and walk away. In many instances, our local council does not even have the financial resources to challenge them legally. For that reason, I am also attracted to new clause 33, which says, ""If a developer has let you down in that way, do not give them any more planning permissions."" It gives the authority the responsibility of saying, ""No more: you are not going to do that to us ever again."" In our area, we will, if we are serious, have to go for compulsory purchase orders. Amendment 68 would take ""hope value"" out of the CPO calculations, which is significant because in the past too many compulsory purchases have failed because developers have applied hope value, which has escalated the cost and prevented us from acquiring property."
"The Bus Services (No. 2) Bill puts the power over local bus services back in the hands of local leaders right across England, enabling them to choose the bus model that works best for their areas. The Government will support local transport authorities that decide that the franchising route is the best option for them, delivering improvements to services in their area. I hope that my hon. Friend's local council will work with her and her constituents to find the best local solution."
"That sounds like a really interesting proposal, which my hon. Friend is right to raise. This country has now given sanctuary to more than 300,000 Ukrainians since the war broke out, of which I am sure we are all incredibly proud. We all recognise the contribution that they are making to our country. I will ensure that a Minister from the Department for Education gives him a reply about the new school."
"Yes, my hon. Friend is completely correct, and I will come to that a bit later in my speech. While we do not oppose the franchising of bus services, we do oppose a particular assumption that underlines this legislation, which is that the public sector is the solution to everything. Some local authorities may have the expertise and resources to successfully franchise passenger bus services, but let us be clear that many do not. The very central premise of the Bill--giving every local authority the unchecked power to implement franchising, regardless of its resources or capacity--is not an act of empowerment; it is irresponsible. By removing the need for the Secretary of State to consent to franchising, as required under the previous Conservative Government, this Government are eliminating crucial safeguards."
"I thoroughly reject that statement by the right hon. Gentleman. He knows that I have a lot of respect for him, but I am afraid that he is completely mistaken on this. The fact is that the courts were already making decisions that undermined our position, legally binding provisional measures could have come within weeks, affecting the operational ability of the base to function as it was, and we believe that an inevitable binding judgment would have followed. The deal has been done and this House is now scrutinising it. I have appeared before two Committees in recent weeks, and of course there will be further such scrutiny over the weeks ahead."
"I thank all Members, from across the Chamber, who have taken part in this debate. I will mention a few key strands that have been raised, just because they align with some of the things that I have asked for. My hon. Friend the Member for Salford (Rebecca Long Bailey) mentioned that the fire response, which is often the first response to these terrible tragedies, is not statutory. Does she agree that a Minister with particular responsibility for drowning prevention might bring that coherence?"
"Happy birthday to you, Mr Speaker. We have been busy since we last met for oral questions. We have confirmed that rooftop solar panels will be standard on all new build homes and have funded PS650 million of clean energy upgrades for over 200 buildings. We have also delivered the first solar projects for 11 schools, secured Royal Assent for Great British Energy--the UK's first national publicly owned energy company in 70 years--launched the marine energy taskforce, signed a green industrial partnership with Norway and kick-started community energy right across the country. We are ambitious in our plans. There is much more to do, but we are doing more than any other Government to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels."
"Mr. Speaker, that is completely ridiculous, because a report out today projects 50,000 job losses in the auto sector because of trade uncertainty. Rather than providing the auto sector with any kind of certainty, the Liberals are doubling down on their risky and dangerous EV mandate. Ford and GM are pleading with the government to end the insanity. Industry projects that the Liberal ban on the gas-powered engine will cost an additional 40,000 high-paying Canadian jobs. The combination of the Liberals' inability to get a deal on tariffs and their self-imposed radical EV mandate will destroy Canada's auto sector. Will the Liberals join us today and call an end to—"
What steps she is taking to help improve passenger rail performance in Cumbria.
"Do the Government know if the US Government are still providing technical military intelligence support, such as electronic or imagery intelligence for Ukraine? If that were cut off by President Trump, would the Americans effectively restrict our British military technical intelligence support to Ukraine?"
"Mr. Speaker, it is true that we need a balanced immigration system that takes into account the capacity of Quebec and Canada to accept immigrants. That is why we are gradually lowering immigration levels. We have also placed restrictions on issuing visas. I would just like to point out one thing. While his colleague from Bowmanville—Oshawa North says that we should scrap the temporary foreign worker program, his constituents in the Quebec City area, in Lévis, Bellechasse and Chaudière-Appalaches, tell us that they need these workers to keep our factories running throughout Quebec."
"Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to thank my new colleague from Calgary Confederation for a quite excellent speech. This debate has been going on now since 6:30 this evening. It is now, as we can see by the clock, 11:40 p.m. I am disappointed that we have not been able to make more progress on finding common ground. There is no question but that every single member of the House is thinking of and concerned for the communities most at risk, where people are scrambling for their life, leaving their home behind and maybe leaving pets behind. Everyone is wondering, with their heart in their throat, whether they will see their home again. The focus of this night's emergency debate, inspired by the motion and the letter to the Speaker from the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre , is about the people and the communities right now that are running for their life. The focus was on Manitoba because it was the Premier of Manitoba who first called for a state of emergency in his province on May 28. The next day, May 29, the Premier of Saskatchewan, Scott Moe, called a state of emergency there. There was no intentionality to leave out the fact that Alberta has major wildfires right now across the province or that British Columbia has wildfires. I am a British Columbia MP. My husband's family has a farm, but the farmhouse is now not used for people who want to do farming. Ever since the summer of 2021, that house has been providing refuge for people who have had to leave their home because of forest fires and because of floods. My husband's daughter nearly died in the heat dome because it hit 50°C in Ashcroft, British Columbia. My step-daughter, Julia, who is in her mid-thirties and healthy, nearly died. With climate events that have hit us over and over again, one might think we would learn things from those emergencies. Despite the fact that I know that people have the goodwill to say we are learning, I think because of the nature of our being so segmented, so siloed between provinces, between territories, between municipalities and between first nations, governments tend to be way ahead of everyone else in realizing what needs to be done, but how do we marshal the resources? What do we actually do to confront the threat? Earlier tonight, someone mentioned that this state of long seasons of wildfires that do not seem to end, that are more intense every year, is a new normal. It is not. We have entered a state of what John Vaillant, author of Fire Weather , calls “the Petrocene”. We have entered a time where everything is unknown; we do not know. What we can say is that this may be the hottest weather we have ever seen, and 2024 was the hottest year on record for the whole planet since records were kept. We might say this is the hottest summer we have seen in the last, my gosh, couple of hundred years. We can also equally say that this is the coolest summer we are going to get for the next couple of hundred years. When we are focusing on forest fires and we are talking about what is happening right now, I want to split my time between saying what it is that we know about climate science and what we should be doing right now, because there has not been a whole lot of science talked about tonight, although some people have made a very good-faith effort. Some members say with good intention that the forests had all the dead trees from the pine beetle outbreak. Right, that is called a positive feedback loop, because the pine beetle outbreak was caused by global warming. Ask our former right-wing British Columbia premier, Gordon Campbell, who figured out that usually the pine beetle is killed in a winter cold snap if the temperature gets to -35°C. That does it; that stops the pest that is endemic to our lodgepole pine forests. Cutting to the chase here, we lost an area of interior British Columbia forest two times the size of Sweden because of global warming. It was the first major multi-billion-dollar impact from the climate crisis. That is why Gordon Campbell was the first premier in the province to bring in a carbon price. Those dead forests stood there, and with hotter and drier weather, the fuel load got hotter, drier and tinder-dry every year, it seems. Sometimes it is described as a very persistent drought. It is the beginning of what could be described as the pointy edge of desertification, because it is not likely to go away. We have fundamentally changed the climate. Atmospheric chemistry has changed. We never had more than 280 parts per million of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere over the last million years. Again, that is based on Antarctic ice core data. It is actual science. It is a number. It is empirical. Now it is 427 parts per million, and when it goes up, it does not go down. Our emissions have grown. We pledged to stop increasing our emissions back in 1992 at the Rio Earth Summit, and still they have grown globally. Burning fossil fuels are the main reason that what was once a beneficial natural phenomenon called “the greenhouse effect” has been overheated and overcharged. The greenhouse effect made this planet alone, in this solar system, warm enough to sustain any life at all. However, we have saturated the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, and we have overwhelmed the natural carbon sinks that pulled them out of the atmosphere. That is what has happened to our forests. They were once carbon sinks; they held more carbon, and they sequestered carbon, but they ceased to be sinks. They are sources of forest disease and carbon from forest fires, which we do not count in our ledgers of where we are in fighting greenhouse gases and reducing emissions. In terms of the science, the best book on this and one I recommend highly, is Fire Weather by John Vaillant, one of Canada's best writers, just in the way he can craft words with the language. He became fascinated with forest fires, and he was studying the Fort McMurray fire, the beast of 2016, and he got deeper and deeper into it. His conclusions are important. People say the boreal forest is a fire-driven ecosystem. Yes, there have always been fires in our boreal, but not these fires. These are what John Vaillant calls the “21st-century fire”. These are fires whose very behaviour has been changed by the climate crisis itself. They burn hotter, they move faster and they create their own weather conditions, high winds, unpredictable, the beast. They are different. John Vaillant concludes, “We're changing the climate...in a way that favours fire way more than it favours us.” We have driven the climate to an overheated state that continues to cause more forest fires, and the fires behave differently. We do need solutions. Yes, we need to fire-smart areas and do a lot of proactive things way in advance, such as building firebreaks around remote rural communities and making sure they are planted with deciduous trees, which are moister and cooler and help service fire breaks. Yes, we need more preparedness, and we need to buy water bombers. The De Havilland Canadair 515 was mentioned earlier by one of my colleagues. It is built partly in Calgary and partly in Sidney, British Columbia. Right now, these water bombers are back-ordered, and all the orders are for the European Union because they ordered a lot of them. The European Union coordinates which countries need them the most and where to send these water bombers. The thing about these forest fires, these 21st-century fires, is that they are different. Have members heard about the zombie fires? They stay below the surface of the soil through the winter. They can have snow cover on top, but the zombie fires are still there, ready to break out in the spring. That is one of the reasons we had fires spread so fast this spring. In the time I have left, I want to focus on the things we can do. One of them is to acknowledge what John Vaillant succinctly testified to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources: “the oil industry is...a fire industry”. This is tough. It is that kind of inconvenient truth we do not want to hear. We want to be able to protect our resources. Bitumen is a very valuable product, probably too valuable to burn if we start thinking about it and start planning ahead. We need to ensure that we give to our children a planet on which they can survive and not allow the climate crisis into an unstoppable, irreversible, self-accelerating spiral with positive feedbacks that leave us with the floods and the heat domes, but beyond that, with the collapse of human civilization. We do not have to accept that. We may be on the very edge of too late, but it is not too late to put in place the mitigation and adaptation measures that will help us preserve the Canada we love on the planet we love."
"Mr. Speaker, I have one question. Last fall, our hon. colleague resigned from the former government's cabinet because she felt she had lost confidence in former Prime Minister Trudeau's fiscal negligence. How does the minister rationalize this new Prime Minister 's fiscal negligence, which is even worse than Justin Trudeau's?"
I have to give the hon. member for Fredericton—Oromocto time for a very brief answer.
"I pay tribute to the hon. Member for West Dorset (Edward Morello) for his speech and for advocating for new clause 156. He is a powerful advocate for his constituent who suffered such horrific things, and I thank him for that. I rise to speak in support of new clause 48, which stands in my name. It would create a new, stand-alone offence of assaulting a delivery worker. Before I begin, though, let me refer Members to my entry in the Register of Member's Financial Interests and my membership of the GMB Union. Delivery workers are vital to our local economies. They link shops with homes, cafes with customers and communities with each other. They help keep our high streets alive and our homes supplied. But too often, they are abused, assaulted, and attacked just for doing their job. Rolston, who rides for Deliveroo, has been verbally abused and threatened with violence on people's doorsteps for asking for ID when delivering alcohol, as the law requires him to do. Emiliana has been riding in Kent since 2018. She has had two motorbikes stolen and has been pelted. Sometimes it is far worse. Claudiu Carol Kondor was an Amazon delivery driver. He was killed in Leeds last year. A thief jumped into his van while he was delivering parcels. Claudiu tried to stop him, clinging to his vehicle for half a mile, pleading with the thief to stop. He was deliberately knocked off and killed. He had bought that van just three weeks earlier and was trying to protect his livelihood. Instead, he lost his life. No one should leave home to go to work and not come back. Those are just a few stories, but they are not isolated incidents. The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers has found that 77% of delivery workers for major retailers such as Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Ocado, Morrisons and Iceland have been a victim of abuse in the past year. A quarter have turned down deliveries because they feared for their safety, and 13% have been physically assaulted. And this is happening during an epidemic of retail crime. Shoplifting has nearly  doubled since the pandemic, and rose by 23% last year alone. In-store retail staff also face absolutely shocking abuse. I welcome the Labour Government's commitment to protecting retail workers with a stand-alone offence, which USDAW, through its freedom from fear campaign, has campaigned on for years. It is the right move, because no one should feel unsafe, or face abuse--verbal or physical--just for doing their job. Delivery workers are on the frontline, too. They work alone, often at night. They are public-facing and can be vulnerable. When something goes wrong--a delay, a missing item, or the wrong order--they are the ones who face the backlash. Too often frustration turns into abuse, violence, or worse. Delivery workers deserve the same protection that this Government are rightly offering to staff in stores. When Parliament places extra responsibilities on delivery riders to police much-needed laws on age verification, it should legislate to provide additional protections for them. New clause 48 is backed by the GMB Union, USDAW, Deliveroo, the British Retail Consortium and UKHospitality. Trade bodies and trade unions are campaigning together, because they know the reality. They see what delivery workers face every day. Since the covid pandemic, delivery riders have become a part of how we shop and we rely on them."
"Madam Speaker, one has only to look at the member's Twitter feed to understand that he is a big fan of the most unpopular prime minister in recent memory, Justin Trudeau, and his policies on an unsecured border, a lack of safety on the streets, the carbon tax, etc. How does the member for Winnipeg West feel, knowing that the Liberal Party had to walk away from his record as a former member of Parliament and from that of his mentor, Justin Trudeau, just to get re-elected in Parliament?"
"Mr. Speaker, what message is the government sending to global partners about Canada's willingness to defend its trade rights in agriculture sectors?"
"Mr. Speaker, congratulations on your role. I want to commend my colleague from Edmonton Riverbend on the amazing, incredible work that he does for men who have been struggling with their mental health and all those who have been battling with their mental health. It is a very commendable field of work and is much-needed in these times. I wonder if the member wants to comment further in regard to the struggles that Canadians are facing. I know that we put a lot of emphasis on the importance of recovery and the need for recovery-type services as they relate to mental health and addictions, but there was not much mention of that in the throne speech. I am wondering if he has any comments on how we need to get back to a recovery-based approach over harm reduction strategies when it comes to working with those struggling and battling with mental health issues and addictions in this country."
"Madam Speaker, I noticed the member referred to the issue that the GST rebate on homes is only for first-time homebuyers. Our plan as the Conservative Party was to use this as a tool to help deal with the housing crisis, but giving only first-time homebuyers the opportunity to use the GST rebate is significantly more truncated and is not going to make a difference, especially with young people who cannot afford their first home to be a brand new home. By spreading it out over more people, we could build those homes, and it would free up more of the other homes that our young people need. Does the member think that would be a good plan in light of the limitations in the Liberal plan?"
"On Sunday I was clear that Hamas should engage in ceasefire talks, should return to the table and should release all hostages. A ceasefire is desperately needed and is the only route forward."
"Mr. Chair, this discussion about major projects is about so much more than just one type of project; it is about building the strongest economy in the G7 and protecting Canada's prosperity in the face of the U.S.-launched trade wars. I would encourage the member to get on board with the one Canadian economy act."
"I thank my hon. Friend for his campaigning for Bury, and for welcoming the investment today. He points to two issues that are really important. First, why is this happening now? It is because of the decisions taken by a Labour Government, after the failed promises of the Conservative party. He asked about child poverty. As he knows, this Government are committed to tackling child poverty, and the child poverty taskforce will report in due course. He will also know that for families who are experiencing child poverty, the best lever to alleviate the situation is helping into work those parents who are able to and want to work. We are investing in affordable, reliable public transport, alongside childcare support at school in the early years. We are not giving people false promises, which they were given in the past; we are giving them a path to being part of the success that we are setting up the country to deliver."
"Mr. Speaker, my colleague should be happy that our government brought Quebec into the auto industry. There have been record investments in the auto industry. I invite my colleague to visit Bécancourt to see what the auto industry looks like. We are building the industry of the future in Quebec, in Ontario and across the country. Those of us on this side of the House have always fought for communities, be they in Brampton, in Oshawa or in Windsor. Together, we will build Canada strong."
"Mr. Chair, the GST holiday, which the former finance minister admitted was unaffordable, was also labelled an investment in affordability. Would that be on the investment budget?"
"My hon. Friend should not worry too much about the Leader of the Opposition representing our country--she never will. If she did, presumably the chair at the NATO summit would have a little sticky note on it saying, ""Busy at PMQs"". That is how unserious her point is. On the substantive question of jobs in Scotland, there is now the real potential to build on what Scotland does. It has a proud history in relation to our defence and security. This provides an opportunity to build on that platform."
"The hon. Member is absolutely right that respite care is important. In my constituency, Sandhurst day centre offers fantastic respite care, allowing people with dementia to stay as active and as social as possible for as long as possible, which we know also keeps people out of hospital for longer. Does she agree that we need to see more support for day centres such as Sandhurst day centre?"
"The hon. Member is right to raise this issue; the current system does track too many people in financial inequality. We want disabled people to have chances in work, which others have always taken for granted. We will invest an additional PS1 billion a year by the end of the decade in work, health and skills support."
"Mr. Chair, this is the fifth transport minister since 2018. Nothing has been done. In 2022, my colleague was the finance minister. I would like to know how much was allocated in her budget in 2022."
"Stratton surgery in my constituency has long been trying to get access to two rooms on the third floor of the surgery that could be used for clinical space, but the ICB seems to be dragging its feet. The rooms were previously used by Cornwall's ICB for maternity services. They are no longer in use, so can the Minister please help in working with the ICB to help Stratton surgery to get access to those much-needed clinical spaces?"
"Mr. Speaker, I always want to inform the member's constituents. We are going to fight. That is something Canadians understand; they know how to fight. That is why we said, “elbows up”. I think it has galvanized Canadians across the nation."
The hon. member.
That is not a point of order.
"Mr. Speaker, I thank the residents of Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge and Mission for re-electing me to a third term in the House of Commons, and previously twice to the B.C. legislature. It is an honour that I take seriously. This has always been a competitive riding, and while this election was no different, support for our message grew significantly. There were 12,000 more votes locally than in previous elections. I saw a shift, particularly among blue-collar workers and young Canadians struggling with affordability. I spoke with thousands of constituents and asked a simple question: Are things better after 10 years of Liberal rule? Not one person said yes, and that says a lot. The Liberals won, not by their own sorry record but by copying Conservative policies like scrapping the carbon tax and by capitalizing on Trump. Still, they won, but make no mistake, Conservative MPs like me will keep fighting every day for a safer, stronger, more affordable and more prosperous Canada."
"Mr. Speaker, it now seems that the Liberal government failed to get a deal on tariffs. In fact, we learned that during the last campaign, the Liberals quietly reduced the retaliatory tariffs to near zero. We found out yesterday that Donald Trump has increased the unjustified tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%. Of course, this is after the person who was elected in this country claimed that he was a man with a plan, that he was the guy we hire in a crisis. What we see now is a 50% increase in tariffs. For steelworkers who say that they are “on the verge of collapse”, for families who are worried about putting food on the table or keeping a roof over their head and for businesses that need certainty, Liberal ministers need to answer to the House. I know that is not something they care to do. I know they want to go home early for their summer vacation. We saw that when they ignored calls from the House to present a budget. However, I think this is important and requires an emergency debate. Therefore, I am requesting one, on behalf of Canadians and on behalf of members on this side of the House."
"Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the leader of the Bloc Québécois on his election. As I have said many times in interviews and here in the House, I want to congratulate him on his election campaign because he ran a good campaign. That is what I think. Now, I would like to get him to talk about this bill, which includes something we have supported for years, namely, a single environmental assessment per project. The leader of the Bloc Québécois will recall that 13 months ago, on May 12, 2024, we introduced a bill to that effect. We debated it, we had a vote, and the Bloc Québécois supported the principle of our bill. Rather than having one environmental assessment, followed by another that might contradict the first and require more time, we wanted a single environmental assessment, with the federal and provincial governments working together. That is the principle we had put forward, and the Bloc Québécois supported that principle. Does the current bill include that same principle?"
"On that point, why should they be like Wales, when they could be like Edinburgh? Will my hon. Friend join me in paying tribute to former councillor Lesley Hinds? One could never meet a more humble Labour councillor, but back in 2016, she rolled out Edinburgh's city-wide 20 mile per hour zone. In 2022, independent peer-reviewed research showed that slight injuries had reduced by 37%, serious injuries had reduced by 33% and fatalities had reduced by 23%. Through the leadership of one person, lives had been saved. Does he agree that we should be using such measures right across the country?"
Tomorrow.
"Mr. Chair, does the minister think it is right to pay asylum claimants social assistance payments for years when they might not have a valid claim in the system?"
I will speak in English. Is the interpretation working in French? It is working now. I will give the floor back to the hon. member for Saskatoon—University.
"Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to the debate all day, and for Canadians who are listening, part of this must be very confusing. I would like to have something clarified. If a Canadian woman has a child in a country outside Canada, with a man from that country, the child is raised in the other country, and then the Canadian woman comes back to Canada, but 30 years from now the child decides to come to Canada, would that child be a Canadian, under Bill C-3 ?"
"I cannot bind the French and Canadian Governments from the Dispatch Box, but we were clear that targeted sanctions would follow, among other actions, if there was not an improvement. I can commit to the House that that remains under review and I will return to this place to provide a further announcement."
We have a proud community in St Athan in the Vale of Glamorgan that is both growing and thriving thanks to the economic opportunity provided by the Bro Tathan enterprise zone. Will the Secretary of State work with Welsh colleagues to progress funding for a new railway station in St Athan to support that growth and provide dignity for the residents?
"Madam Speaker, I request a recorded vote, please."
"Many Members present will look forward to the day when it is possible for people in this country to die in peace, with dignity and at a time of their choosing. The opportunity to bring that about is closer than ever before, but it can happen only if Members vote against the Bill today. The express will of the House, as reflected in the Second Reading vote; the momentum generated by the Bill; and the support of the Prime Minister, as we understand it, to change the law have created a moment when it is possible to grasp the chance to bring in assisted dying legislation, but I warn Members that if this Bill passes, the case for assisted dying will be fatally undermined, and it will put back their cause for a generation. I have sat through Committee and Report, listened to the oral evidence and participated in the debates. This Bill, if it passes, will be challenged in the courts. It will be subject to endless attempts to amend it in Parliament. It will be difficult to implement effectively, and ultimately it will lose the confidence of the public. It was immensely challenging to properly debate the Bill in Committee, because we frequently found ourselves needing an understanding of medical practice or points of law that MPs are not typically expert in. We spent many hours, for example, debating whether or not the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 were sufficient for someone who was making the decision to die. Of course, we consulted experts, and some said the provisions were sufficient, some said they were not. I do not believe that this particular decision is one that politicians are best placed to make."
"I agree with the hon. Gentleman. We want all schools to offer a broad and balanced curriculum, including outdoor activities, sport, PE and physical activity, and to ensure that every child can benefit. That is why we are legislating to ensure that the national curriculum applies to all schools, through the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill."
"Mr. Speaker, it is always a distinct honour to rise in this chamber to represent the good people of Souris—Moose Mountain, a region that shaped who I am. It is where I was born, where I was raised and where I learned the value of hard work, integrity and service. Our riding is built on the strength of those who rise early and work hard: farmers, ranchers, oil and gas workers, power producers and entrepreneurs. Their industries do not just support families in our region; they help drive the Canadian economy. The people of Souris—Moose Mountain embody the best of rural Canada. They are self-reliant, community-minded and deeply rooted in their values. I was raised in that environment, and I will carry those principles with me into every debate, every vote and every conversation in this House. To the good people back home, I say thanks for their trust and their example. It is a privilege to serve them, and I will continue to be a strong and steady voice for them and our region here in Ottawa."
"Mr. Chair, that is an unacceptable answer. I am not asking the minister about criminal proceedings. I am asking the minister about his department's failures to enforce the rules that are specifically under his mandate. He refused to answer my first question, so my next question is this: On what basis was GC Strategies, which had no technical capabilities, pre-qualified as an IT contractor based on the rules set out by the department the minister oversees?"
"Mr. Speaker, Trump's 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum are wrong and an unjustified attack on our Canadian economy. This means that manufacturers in Middlesex—London are cutting shifts, delaying investment and relocating to the U.S. These tariffs are a direct threat to Canadian jobs and our economic sovereignty. The Prime Minister promised Canadians that he would defend us. He said he had a plan, but in responding to the U.S., the Prime Minister's elbows have gone limp. I will ask the Prime Minister this: Was the entire Liberal campaign just theatre?"
"In Rossendale and Darwen, the Valley leadership academy is a vital school serving some of our most disadvantaged communities, yet it was recently identified as a stuck school following successive ""requires improvement"" Ofsted assessments. The staff and leadership at the school are working incredibly hard to drive improvement, and we are starting to see positive signs. Will the Minister therefore please update me on what Labour is doing to support them?"
"Mr. Speaker, we could get a plaque with that phrase etched onto it. In short, the Prime Minister eliminated the carbon tax and gave Canadians $4 billion up front to reimburse them for a tax that they will never pay. Meanwhile, he gave nothing to Quebeckers. He admitted it. That $4 billion is not linked to any revenue that would justify that money being paid back. That $4 billion is being added directly to the deficit, just like the $6 billion in tax cuts. The government is doing all of this without tabling a budget or providing an economic update. Will the Prime Minister fix this obvious injustice against Quebeckers?"
"I would like to concentrate not just on purely rural areas, but on places like Surrey. In my constituency, the 514 bus connects Esher and Molesey, two important centres of our community, but it runs only twice on weekdays and once on a Saturday. On Sundays it is never to be seen. The service was severely cut back in 2016. To travel a distance of a mile and a half, people have to get a bus more than five miles into London and out again, which takes 40 minutes--"
"For my Cramlington and Killingworth constituency, like for so many others as we have heard today, buses are vital. They are often the only source of public transport. They are essential for accessing work, health appointments or seeing family and friends. That is why I launched my big bus survey earlier this year, hearing from hundreds of residents. The response was clear: too many people feel let down due to unreliable and inaccessible transport. That is especially true for people with disabilities, families and older people. Under the previous Government, far too many routes were withdrawn, reduced or made less direct. I thought I would share just a few experiences from my residents. In Holywell and Seaton Delaval, they spoke of the withdrawal of the No. 19, which they relied on to reach local shops, healthcare and social activities. In Cramlington, local people described long waits for buses and no services at all on Sundays. Many shared concerns that while services into city centres exist, there is a lack of connectivity between local areas. One constituent told me that while her workplace is a mere 10-minute drive away, taking the bus requires travelling in the opposite direction first, doubling the journey time. Some told me they work from home instead of the office more often,  because they just do not want to face the buses. Another, when their car broke down, took a week's leave rather than have to face the bus. Residents in East Hartford told me that replacement services sometimes skip stops entirely without warning. In Shiremoor, another resident told me that to travel just 2.5 miles they have to take a metro and then a bus because no direct route exists, massively increasing costs. In Wideopen--where I am from and grew up--and Seaton Burn, residents shared how few services come through the villages compared with a decade ago. In another case, a resident told me that rather than face the delay of the bus, they ran two miles to the nearest metro to avoid being late for jury service. In Backworth, people described frustration at the lack of regular services, while others expressed a desire to switch from car use for environmental reasons, but they simply cannot without reliable information, real-time updates and dependable timetables. The Bill could not be more timely. For too long, too many people in my area have been let down by bus operators favouring profits for commercial companies over delivering the public transport local people need and deserve. I share these stories because they are important. Every time the bus does not turn up, every time the route is cut back, every time it does not stop, it chips away at people's independence, with every act stripping local people of their dignity bit by bit, forcing them to either rely on others or to do without. I glad that this Government will now to shift that balance, giving local people a greater say in their transport. People across the towns and villages of my constituency have told me that the system is not working and has to change. Buses in my area are a lifeline, not a luxury. I am pleased, on behalf of those constituents, that we are taking action to ensure they get the services they deserve. Frankly, they cannot come soon enough."
"I had hoped for a more precise answer to my question. Rather than pressing again for exact figures or a departmental breakdown, let me proceed down a related line of inquiry. Is there any mechanism, legal or otherwise, that the Mauritian Government could use to reopen the Chagos negotiations or to request further financial or material assistance in a way that could result in additional cost to the British taxpayer?"
"Mr. Chair, what I will say is, post-pandemic, had we not increased our immigration levels, our economy would have absolutely shrunk."
"Mr. Speaker, the layoffs in the forestry industry are an indication of what is going to happen with steel and aluminum if Ottawa does not change its current approach, which is to do nothing at all. We know that it is not what they are known for, but maybe the Liberals could be proactive for once. They need to proactively offer cash to the industry and create a wage subsidy to prevent a wave of layoffs. Tariffs doubled yesterday. Could Ottawa take action for once before plants start closing and jobs start disappearing?"
"Madam Speaker, you raised important points about how the Liberal gas ban would impact farmers and rural communities. I keep thinking back to the blackout in Alberta earlier this year, where people were told to turn off the lights, lower thermostats and avoid using appliances right in the middle of winter. Are your constituents worried that forcing everyone onto the electrical grid will make things worse, not better? What are you hearing from people about the reliability risk of this rushed transition?"
"Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister and his cabinet took the time to prepare a spending plan, but they did not make the time to prepare a plan to pay for it. Last week, I asked a simple question: “With the economic storm clouds moving in, how is it possible not to have a budget this spring?” Since then, the Liberal government presented the main estimates to Parliament to request nearly half a trillion dollars, $486 billion, to fund the government until next March. However, it has not presented a budget, which is the very document that shows how it intends to pay for all of this spending. How irresponsible is that? Imagine someone walking into a bank for a mortgage with all of their expenses, their car payments, groceries and student debt, but refusing to provide evidence of their income. Any lender would tell them to come back when they have evidence of their income. As a finance professional of 14 years, I say the same to this Liberal government: Come back when there is a plan to pay for all of this spending. The government says economic conditions may change over the summer. Yes, there is an uncertain world, there are summits, and there are shifting forecasts. That is exactly why we need a budget. When income is lost, we budget. When costs rise, we budget. When we want to change our circumstances, we budget. Our GDP is struggling, our productivity is down, our purchasing power is crumbling and the unemployment rate is rising. These are the fingerprints of 10 years of failed Liberal policies. If the Prime Minister and his finance minister want to be taken seriously as stewards of the economy, they need to do what every family, every business and every government must do: put forward a budget. It is my sincere hope that we can work together to provide relief to Canadian families and businesses and to steer Canada in the right direction. However, the government needs to provide the fundamental information for every parliamentarian to make an informed decision on what is best for Canadians. On matters of finance, my trust is built on numbers, on accountability and on a budget. I ask again: With the economic storm clouds moving in, how is it possible not to produce a budget this spring?"
"Mr. Chair, how do political, hand-picked projects give investors certainty?"
"Madam Speaker, I would like to inform the House that Thursday shall be an allotted day."
"It is important to recognise that in our country, at Sizewell and at Urenco, uranium is enriched at between 3% and 5%. The International Atomic Energy Agency has found 60% enrichment in Iran. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, and we are doing all we can diplomatically to get a negotiated settlement on that problem. Of course, we continue to press for aid to the Palestinians."
"It is both a pleasure and a privilege to close today's excellent debate on Armed Forces Day. I pay tribute to colleagues across the House for their thoughtful and passionate contributions. I rise on behalf of His Majesty's loyal Opposition to express our sincere thanks to all those who serve and have served in our armed forces--regulars, reservists, veterans and cadets--and to the families who support them every step of the way. Armed Forces Week, which began on Monday and culminates this Saturday, 28 June, with Armed Forces Day, is a national moment to say one thing clearly and collectively: thank you. Thank you to those defending the UK and our interests around the world. Our armed forces represent the very best of our country: committed, courageous and professional. They work tirelessly, often in the most challenging conditions, to keep us safe and uphold the values that we share. Today's debate has been particularly powerful because of the personal reflections shared by so many right hon. and hon. Members. The hon. Member for Stockton North (Chris McDonald) represents a strong military constituency--one in 20 serves, or has served, in the military. Having watched the hon. Gentleman in defence debates, it is clear to me that he is a passionate advocate for his constituency, with strong military links. He talked about the Royal Military Police, a regiment that plays a vital role that we need to hear more about. I enjoyed hearing about the airborne police officer unit--an interesting skillset that we could potentially see in the Met. He also talked powerfully about his constituents Kate and Rachel, veterans who faced internal adversity because of their gender and sexuality. As he said, rightly, courage does not know any gender or sexuality. The hon. Member for Mansfield (Steve Yemm) talked strongly about the skills that military people bring to civilian life. Having seen many veterans in my constituency make that transition, I know how many skills they bring. He advocated for more support for them to make that transition, and mentioned the real need for the armed forces covenant to be strengthened. I was glad to hear about the reception he held here recently in support of the covenant, and it would be good to support him in future such endeavours. We must ensure that the sacrifices made by our service personnel are never met with silence, as he says, but with real lasting commitment and action. I agree with my right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Goole and Pocklington (David Davis) that gratitude for service is not enough on its own. Only a quarter of veterans believe that service is valued, and I completely agree that that needs to change. He spoke powerfully about Northern Ireland veterans, especially the Special Air Service, a regiment in which he served. He spoke about the injustice that group of special forces soldiers, and others in the military, face from the opening up of domestic legal frameworks. Those veterans were in battles that were fought under orders, under the  yellow card legal system and under the view of the Royal Military Police. There were strong legal frameworks surrounding those operations, and my right hon. Friend made the point that those veterans joined up and served our country, but the view is now that they can be prosecuted in later life. That is not right, and I look forward to the issue being debated later this month and, I hope, overturned. The petition on the subject is currently live, and there has been a significant uptick in the numbers signing it in the last few hours. The hon. Member for Bolton North East (Kirith Entwistle) made remarks about her personal connection to the armed forces, and her husband's service in the reserves. It was interesting to hear about the 216 Royal Artillery regiment in her constituency and her link to the Royal British Legion. She made a powerful case for greater support for training, and I look forward to the Minister's response to it. I also echo her support for expanding the cadet programme. I spent many happy years in the air cadets, and I see what value they bring to society and as a pathway for people to join the military. I align myself with her comments. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Ben Obese-Jecty) was, as ever, a strong advocate and champion for the military units in his constituency. We regularly hear him calling for more support. He served the UK in operations during the global war on terror in Afghanistan and Iraq, and he knows first hand the challenges that come from the evolution of war and the need for kit to keep pace with the evolution of threats. As he rightly said, no plan survives first contact with the enemy, and those words remain as true today as they have ever been. It is crucial that we not only learn the lessons of modern conflicts, but ensure that our armed forces retain a broad range of capabilities to meet the demands of the evolving environments that we may be involved with in the coming years. My hon. Friend also made the fair and timely observation that making our armed forces work on a hot Saturday in late June is perhaps not the best way to honour them. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes (Melanie Onn) rightly highlighted the volunteers who work tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure that our armed forces are commemorated properly. They often miss out on enjoying the events themselves, so I hope that they will find time to relax and enjoy some sunshine with their families. We thank all of them and their grassroots groups for their vital support for these commemorations. She also shared a moving story about her great-aunt and mother, which touched many of us in the Chamber. They welcomed Polish servicemen into their home and they became part of their family nearly 50 years ago, demonstrating how service personnel become deeply woven into our communities and lives. As always, I am sure the Red Arrows will deliver a magnificent display over Cleethorpes this weekend. I hope that she manages to enjoy an ice cream--and hopefully a few beers, too--with the Secretary of State when he is in her constituency this weekend. The hon. Member for Portsmouth North (Amanda Martin) is the proud mother of serving Royal Navy sailor, Olly, whom she has spoken about many times. She represents a city with a high number of service personnel and veterans--one of the highest in the country--and one of the homes of the Royal Navy. I say that as a Devon MP, and standing opposite the Minister, who  represents Devonport. She also raised an interesting point around the protective services BTEC course. I have seen the value of that at first hand in my constituency at Bicton college, and it is interesting to see young people flourish in that environment. Again, just like the cadets, it provides a strong pathway for those who want to go into the military or other protective services. The hon. Member for North Devon (Ian Roome), again, represents a strong military constituency--4,800 veterans and 11% of households. He has long been a proud advocate for the Royal Marines, with the Commando Logistic Regiment in his constituency. I was impressed to hear about the work he has done with SSAFA, the armed forces charity. It was enjoyable and interesting to go away with him recently on the trip he spoke about to Normandy to see the D-day commemoration. It was particularly poignant to meet the D-day veteran Norman Ashford, who is 100 years old. He was a Royal Marine and, as the hon. Member said, made countless trips up and down on to the beaches that day. I had a great deal of respect for him when I met him and heard his stories. The hon. Member for Ilford South (Jas Athwal) spoke about the RAF photographic units--tales of derring-do. It is a unit that I have enjoyed learning about as the campaign has been growing, and I look forward to that debate being rescheduled and brought back to the House. He made some interesting points about the contributions of people from all over the world, including the Commonwealth, to our armed forces, and the need to celebrate them this Armed Forces Day. It was interesting to hear about Hardit Malik, the first Indian fighter pilot in world war one with the Royal Flying Corps, fighting against the famous German Red Baron. Lastly, my near neighbour in the south-west, the hon. Member for Tiverton and Minehead (Rachel Gilmour), has a strong military family, and I have spoken to her many times about her brother's service. She raises an interesting and important point about the pathway for people who want to join the military. She talked about her constituent trying to join the Intelligence Corps and the waiting time to join being far too long. It would be interesting to discuss whether something can be done to provide concrete start dates. I, too, speak from personal experience. I am proud to have served in the Royal Marines, and after leaving regular service a decade ago, I was fortunate to continue as a Royal Marine reservist with the Royal Navy parachute display team. It was--to say the least--one of the more unconventional side-gigs in public service, giving me a literal bird's eye view of Armed Forces Day celebrations. Over several years, I had the privilege of parachuting into national Armed Forces Day events in Guildford, Cleethorpes and Llandudno. From thousands of feet above, seeing the crowds gathered to show their support was genuinely humbling. Although I will admit that, at that height, my primary concern was not so much national pride as avoiding crash-landing into someone's picnic. Those kinds of events are not just pageantry, as Members from across the House have said today; they are powerful tools for engagement and recruitment. I have vivid childhood memories of attending large air shows and other military displays, but one personal favourite, and one that I am sure many hon. Members attended, was the royal tournament at Earl's Court here  in London. The Navy's high-octane field gun competition and the Royal Signals' famous White Helmets motorcycle display team made a lasting impression on me, and without doubt helped shape my decision to join the military. As defence spending rises, and as difficult choices are made to support that increase, it will be more important than ever to showcase our armed forces and their capabilities. That visibility ensures public understanding and accountability for where taxpayers' money is spent. There is also a broader point. As the national security strategy outlined this week, the threats we face are serious. The possibility of a hostile attack on the UK, which for many decades was seen as unimaginable, is now again within the realm of possibility. A time may come when we must once more defend the things that we hold dear. We must therefore forge a renewed relationship with defence--not seeing it just as a line in the Budget, but recognising it as a fundamental pillar of our national security and resilience. Armed Forces Day is about more than capability; it is about morale. It is about recognising the extraordinary service of our sailors, soldiers and aviators. Public support matters, as it lifts spirits, strengthens bonds and reminds those in uniform that their country stands firmly behind them. That support must go further than symbolic gestures, as we have heard repeatedly in today's debate. The armed forces covenant is a solemn pledge--a year-round commitment from Government, businesses and communities to treat those who serve, and their families, with fairness and respect in everyday life. The message from today's debate is clear: gratitude must be backed up by action on housing, employment and a dignified transition to civilian life. These are responsibilities we all share. The Government's strategic defence review rightly proposes a whole-of-society approach to national defence. It is welcome, and it is necessary. Defence is not just the task of our armed forces; it is a shared civic responsibility. True resilience relies not only on military capability, but on strong institutions, cohesive communities and national unity. At the heart of that resilience is trust--a social contract between the nation and those who serve it. We must do all we can to honour that trust, which is why we cannot ignore the serious concerns raised by veterans, especially those who served in Northern Ireland. The strength of feeling in that community is real and justified. My right hon. Friend the Member for Goole and Pocklington mentioned that in his speech. I place on record my thanks to the Minister for Veterans and People, the hon. Member for Birmingham Selly Oak (Al Carns), for his principled support for a judicial review of the Clonoe inquest, and I hope his judgment is actively being sought by his colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office, especially as they reflect on their plans to repeal the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023. Our veterans deserve clarity, compassion and fairness. The strength of the Royal Navy, the British Army and the Royal Air Force lies not just in firepower or training, but in the character of those who serve. Their dedication, discipline and selflessness are a credit to our country. So let us use this Armed Forces Week not only to reflect, but to renew our commitments to serve those  who serve us, to honour those who have worn the uniform, and to ensure that future generations understand the debt we owe. We are grateful. We are proud. We will remember them. We will support them. And we will thank them."
"Mr. Speaker, again, I would say that my hon. colleagues need to look at the tapes. The Premier of Saskatchewan was supportive. The Premier of Alberta was supportive. The representative from British Columbia was supportive. Why can our colleagues not get supportive to help us build the strongest economy in the G7?"
"I ask unanimous consent that the following motions to commit be printed in the record:  Ms. Baldwin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1 to the Committee on Finance of the Senate with instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session, with changes that-- (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and (2) strike provisions that will lower coverage rates, reduce benefits, or decrease affordability for individuals residing in rural communities receiving coverage through the Medicaid program or the Children's Health Insurance Program; increase the likelihood of the closure of rural hospitals, clinics, or other healthcare facilities serving rural communities, cause higher rates of uncompensated care; and increase costs for individuals with other types of insurance.

"Mr. Speaker, there is a reason we have a new Prime Minister and a new housing and infrastructure minister who are here to serve and here to scale up building affordable housing across Canada. Based on the experience I have had at city and provincial levels, I am here to deliver. Canada is facing a housing crisis. This government is committed to a leadership role, working with all of our partners, every level of government, and private and non-profit sectors to bring down the cost of housing. This is going to stimulate our economy. We are building one Canadian economy in the face of the tariff threats. We have to leverage the economic activity we see in the housing sector and make that a critical part of our economic growth to be the fastest-growing economy in the G7. We are looking at “build Canada homes” as a big opportunity to take it to the next level."
"Mr. Speaker, I would like the minister to clarify whether she means to suggest that Quebeckers would agree to having a project to build a pipeline across Quebec imposed on them."
"One of the first pieces of casework that I picked up was from a young woman pushing her two children through central Wednesbury. We moved to the side and she told me that she was in temporary accommodation, and then she showed me the insect bites up her arm. In my council area, there are 21,000 people on the housing waiting list and nearly 550 families in temporary accommodation--awful, substandard bed and breakfasts, from which it takes multiple buses to get the kids to school. Will my right hon. Friend confirm that our  share of the PS39 billion for council and social housing is coming to Tipton and Wednesbury and Coseley, to the Black Country and to the west midlands to build the homes that our local families need?"
"Mr. Chair, we have a list, and the premiers were very vocal about their intention to move with alacrity."
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the first time in the House. First of all, I would like to thank the people of Brome—Missisquoi for placing their trust in me. I will be a hands-on MP, and I will listen to what they have to say. This victory would not have been possible without the unwavering support of my campaign team, the volunteers, and my wife, Sylvie, who has been a source of invaluable support. Today, I would like to recognize that we celebrated International Trails Day in Eastman by honouring the Trans Canada Trail, a true national treasure that connects Canadians from coast to coast to coast. Since 2019, tens of thousands of dollars have been invested in our trails in Brome—Missisquoi. The plan is to invest $154,000 by 2026 to improve access and enhance the experience. I congratulate the local stakeholders who are working to preserve and improve this vital network. I reiterate my support for this initiative, both here and across the country."
The hon. member for York—Durham.
"The hon. Lady makes an incredibly important point, and I will touch on that briefly in my remarks. I am minded to take no more interventions, because otherwise I will be stealing time from others. There are three questions we need to ask. First, are we happy for this Bill--not for the principle, but for this Bill as drafted--to become law? Many of the elements that I have already discussed are concerning. In the criteria set out, medical professionals do not need to seek deeper motivation. We have said there is not a real choice between palliative care and assisted dying, because one will have a statutory underpinning and the other will not. As I say, the ""gold standard"" protections were lost in Committee, because a number of professional bodies and--"
"Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise in the House to comment on the legislation that we are being asked to vote on and to consider the best interests of our constituents and Canadians. I know this is a bill supposedly dealing with affordability, but if we peel back the onion, it is fairly meagre. There have been a lot of comments asking, “If this was in the Conservatives platform, why won't you support it? Are you going to support it? What's your position?” I would say, if the Liberals are going to steal our ideas, they should steal all of them and go full on with them, not just with half measures. If the Liberals are going to take good ideas, they can take the full good idea. If they take half an idea, well, they will get half the result, or I guess, they get Liberals. My apologies, I did want to mention that I will be sharing my time with the member for King—Vaughan . I am still learning the ropes, as members can see. There has been a lot of discussion, in the first week or so, on this bill and from the parliamentary secretary, about this new government, the new Liberals. They are saying it, but there is almost a bit of a wily smile behind it when they say it, as though they do not quite believe it themselves. That is quite understandable when we consider that pretty much everyone in the front bench has returned from the Justin Trudeau government, including the member for Winnipeg North , who we are always happy to hear and see. I am beginning to understand that he is here often and speaks passionately all the time, and I appreciate that."
What steps his Department is taking to decouple electricity and gas prices
"I rise today because the President's trash bill is out here cutting funding for a program that supports low-income kids and families, supports our seniors, and supports those without housing. I rise today because those cuts will leave people in my district hungry. I rise today because that is unacceptable. I am talking about SNAP. SNAP provides children and families in my district and across this country with the help they need to put food on the table. It reduces food insecurity, and it boosts our local economies. Our communities can't afford cuts to these benefits. It is a vital lifeline for my constituents. Over 733,000 Oregonians used SNAP benefits last year, and that is over one in six residents in the State. It is unconscionable to give $2 trillion in tax breaks to the ultra- wealthy by defunding this food assistance American families depend on. Mr. Speaker, we can do better."
"I rise today to recognize the outstanding contributions that Ms. Patricia Schneider has made to our community through her volunteerism with the Pregnancy & Family Life Center. Ms. Schneider is part of a team of selfless and dedicated women who have worked at the Center in Inverness for several years. Their roles include working each week in the food pantry and clothing room. Last year, 472 clients were served, and more than 65,000 pounds of food was distributed. These critical volunteers also ensure families receive essential items for their infants and young children to include: formula, diapers, pull ups, baby wipes and wash, as well as age specific clothing. In 2024, more than 44,000 diapers and 9,500 items of clothing were distributed. These volunteers have a `can do' attitude no matter how large the challenge. They also have tremendous teamwork. They sort through all donations, retain those appropriate for a pregnancy center and then share other serviceable items with community partners. Ms. Schneider also makes personal birthday cards for each client to help them feel connected. When volunteers are united in an important mission, it naturally fosters camaraderie which is great for anyone who works or volunteers at the Center. All of these women maintain a loving demeanor and greet each client with a warm smile and conversation (and sometimes a hug). The Center's clients feel welcomed and cared for because of the lived values of love, respect, compassion, and family centeredness that is regularly displayed by these dedicated volunteers. The benefit to the community is great and the impact far reaching. It is clear that Patricia Schneider has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility."
I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.
"My hon. Friend is a champion for Glasgow airport, and as she knows, Scotland needs investment in transport and infrastructure of the kind we are now seeing across England and Wales. The Scottish Government will receive the largest real-terms settlement since devolution began in 1998 as a result of this month's spending review. I hope this budget increase will be put to good use."
"Madam Speaker, as a young mother in the early 1980s, I experienced the challenges so many mothers are facing today. Under the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Liberal government, our resources were hijacked and our economy was ravaged. Interest rates rose to 22%. When we talk about inflation being the highest in 40 years under the current Liberal government, it takes me back 40 years to when we, as small business owners with a young family, experienced the devastation in real time. Now my children and grandchildren are facing the same challenges, with higher food costs that alone are overwhelming. The Liberal Prime Minister is more of the same, causing even more chaos. Ten years and counting of Liberal inflationary deficits have record numbers of Canadians needing food banks, single mothers watering down milk and Canadians eating less nutritious meals. What is Prime Minister “I am a banker and I know how to grow the economy without spending money” doing to solve this inflationary crisis? He is bringing in half a trillion dollars in new spending."
Agreed.
"Centres such as the one that my hon. Friend describes in her constituency do excellent work and help to reduce youth offending. If she writes to me about the case that she refers to, I will look into it."
"Mr. Speaker, something one of my colleagues said reminded me of one of the first requests I received from a constituent after I was elected in 2019. This poor mother came to my office with her little one in a car seat. She was no longer getting paid and was in distress. I realized then just how incompetent the federal apparatus is. Other examples include ArriveCAN and the CBSA assessment and revenue management system. There have been issues around managing and wasting public funds. In March, just before the election, articles were published about the new Cúram platform, which is used to manage the old age security system. The article suggested that the new old age security software might be the next Phoenix. The same kinds of mistakes keep happening, which suggests some degree of systemic incompetence. First it was mothers in distress, and now seniors are in danger of not receiving their pensions. What are my colleague's thoughts on that?"
"Madam Chair, my colleague will be pleased to see that in the estimates that we published, the Canada health transfer will increase by $2.6 billion. That is going to be important to support—"
"Mr. Chair, in 2015 the government was elected and promised a balanced budget by 2019. It is 2025. The fall economic statement had no date for a balanced budget in sight. On what date will the minister project having a balanced budget?"
"Mr. Speaker, during the election campaign, the Prime Minister and the Liberals promised to lower taxes for families. For an average family, that meant saving $825. The Parliamentary Budget Officer released a report today. The actual amount is $250, not $825. That is less than a third of what was expected. The Prime Minister is an honourable man, to say the least. Could he stand up and apologize to Canadians for misleading them?"
"Mr. Chair, we recognize that there are challenges in our housing and infrastructure. That is why we have tabled the levels plan that works on sustainable immigration. We are reducing our permanent residency—"
"Mr. Speaker, we often hear from the Conservatives about the issue of a budget. The reality is that when Stephen Harper was elected as prime minister, it was in February, and he did not introduce a budget until May. There was a federal election on April 28, and we have a new government and a new Prime Minister . Does the member really believe it is that simple to put forward a national budget when billions and billions of dollars are being spent? It took Mr. Harper, many years ago, a number of months to present a budget. Why does the Conservative Party seem to have a differing opinion regarding Harper's performance or capabilities and the current Prime Minister 's?"
"Regardless of whether local inquiries are commissioned by councils, will there be an opportunity for those same areas to fall under the remit of the national inquiry, to ensure that some of the ongoing issues to which the Home Secretary herself has referred are caught within the new framework of the inquiry?"
"today the House advances another pillar of President Trump's America First agenda with the passage of the American Entrepreneurs First Act of 2025. This bill ensures that taxpayer-funded SBA loans are reserved for American small businesses, not illegal aliens, certainly not children or people who are dead. Americans are grateful to finally have a President in office who is protecting their taxpayer dollars and looking to weed out waste, fraud, and abuse. Billions of loans have been flagged for suspected fraud and ineligible applicants, including illegal aliens. The Trump administration has instituted a policy requiring SBA loan applications to include citizenship verification provisions. It is common sense. This bill codifies these Trump-era safeguards into law so that no future administration can turn Federal relief into a global giveaway. This is about ensuring we have the validation mechanisms in place to ensure the rule of law. It is about prioritizing Americans. It is about making sure that when a small business owner like those in Texas, or anywhere else, fills out an application, they know the system is fair and the resources are theirs to access. With every bill codifying President Trump's EOs, we are moving closer to a government that puts America first, protects American workers, and restores American sovereignty. Let's support this bill."
The phrase that I have used about no military endeavour being able to achieve this without diplomacy has been used by the US and by the Israelis themselves.
"Mr. Speaker, I listened to my colleague's story of the company in her riding, but the great irony of her speech is that this bill would do nothing for that company because she described a provincial barrier, not a federal one. We have heard a lot about that $200 billion. That is all trade barriers, not just federal ones. Will she give us a real, correct number for what this bill would do?"
"Probably the largest single driver of child poverty in my communities is the enormous cost of housing. The average house price in my community is up to 13 times average household incomes. That drives grinding poverty, particularly among children. Will the Secretary of State have a word with her right hon. and hon. Friends in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to ensure that a disproportionate amount of housing grant goes to rural communities such as mine, in particular with the Windermere Gateway scheme?"
"Mr. Chair, it is an issue of B.C. jurisdiction, and in Canada, we respect jurisdiction among federal, provincial, territorial, local and indigenous governments. We work in partnership, but this is the B.C. government's jurisdiction."
I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Balderson).
"I, too, wish you a happy birthday, Mr Speaker. I very much welcome the statement, which is about the future-visioning and future-proofing of our energy security and production. I particularly welcome the PS2.5 billion investment in fusion, including for the STEP--spherical tomahawk for energy production --programme at West Burton in north Nottinghamshire. I thank Ministers for their work to secure that, which is very welcome indeed. The process has already started, with the tender outcomes for the construction and the design and technology to be announced later this year. I am championing British companies, which are very much part of that process. I am excited about the thousands of jobs and skills in new infrastructure that will be developed because of this programme. The work has already started on the skills partnership, which is stretching right across regions including the east midlands, Lincolnshire and South Yorkshire. That partnership is working with our further education colleges, our universities and the advanced manufacturing centre in Rotherham. Does the Secretary of State agree that left-behind, red wall areas such as mine are where we need investment to revise our energy production and our industry? This is where we start, and I want to see more."
"I start, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell) did, with an ask of the Minister. As she will have heard, this issue is apolitical, and we are raising it very much because we care about our communities. Can we increase the flexibility for banking hubs to be rolled out throughout the country? I apologise, because I should really have started by congratulating the hon. Member for Blyth and Ashington (Ian Lavery) on securing this important debate. In South West Hertfordshire I have seen the decline of high streets, including a reduction in the number of banking branches. Nationwide, which has been mentioned, deserves credit for proactively retaining its high street presence, which does help my residents and, I am sure, others across the country. In Rickmansworth in my constituency, the local post office manager, Danny, has stepped up and is now managing a banking hub, which allows my residents access to the frontline banking services to which they would not normally have access.  I am also working alongside two of my councillors in Abbots Langley--Councillor Vicky Edwards and Councillor Ian Campbell--and I hope the Minister will encourage the powers that be to see that, where there is a real need for communities to have a banking presence, banking hubs are an obvious solution. If we want our high streets to remain viable, we need to encourage people to continue to come down to the high street. Historically, that has meant services such as banking. That will, I hope, increase footfall for our local cafes, hairdressers and all the other services associated with the high street. We have heard about the 6,300 banks that have closed since 2015. I am a former retailer, and I understand that high streets change, but from a policy perspective, Parliament needs to create the framework that ensures high streets are as we want them to be. If we do not proactively encourage banking hubs to be in the centre of our towns--yes, ATMs are important, but they are typically in places such as out-of-town petrol stations--we are not helping small retailers and convenience stores that rely on emergency purchases of a pint of milk and the like. I will close, because I am conscious of the time, with a pledge from me--and, I hope, those on my Front Bench--that if the Government step up and say they will increase the flexibility of banking hubs, they will have our support, because cash remains king. We have spoken before about digital exclusion, and it will have a massive impact on a minority of our population if we do not get this right."
"Mr. Speaker, the minister spoke about the responsibilities of Canadian citizens, but those responsibilities include paying taxes to pay for services such as health care. The bill goes well beyond closing a loophole for a small group of people, which previous Conservative legislation and Conservatives supported. By contrast, the PBO estimated that the bill would grant citizenship to over 100,000 people in five years. There are no security vetting requirements for persons who fall under the bill, and the bill contains no consecutive residency requirements. Failing that, the bill contains no requirements for people without consecutive residency for any mechanism such as, let us say, paying taxes. Why would the minister, knowing all the testimony that happened in the last Parliament on this particular issue, continue to devalue Canadian citizenship in this way?"
"I commend the hon. Member for making that important point--these young people who are using off-road bikes are not only tearing up communities and green spaces, but putting themselves at severe risk. I commend him for bringing that point to the House, because it is such an important one."
Hopefully the rail line that takes me into my constituency will be the first on the list.
"I thank the Chair for his leadership; we enjoy being under it. To focus on one thing, energy costs are causing havoc around the country, leading to many companies going to the wall.  Does he think this emergency should be to dealt with by cutting energy costs, dealing with the distortions between gas and electricity, and giving better access to manufacturers so that they can get the power they need?"
"it is a privilege to rise today to recognize Mr. Clint Jackson for his service at Withlacoochee River Electric Cooperative (WREC) and his remarkable role in the Light Up Navajo Project. In May, a courageous team of 16 WREC employees traveled over 1,800 miles to the remote, rugged terrains of Arizona and New Mexico, where they spent two weeks installing vital electrical infrastructure for Navajo families who have lived without power for generations. Their efforts brought light, safety, and hope to communities long overlooked, allowing children to study after dark, families to preserve food, and elders to live with greater comfort. Despite daunting challenges and limited equipment, the WREC team completed a demanding project in just eight days--far ahead of expectations--demonstrating professionalism, humility, and unwavering commitment to this life-changing mission. The impact of WREC's work goes far beyond electricity; it represents a bridge to connection, opportunity, and the return of future generations to their ancestral homes. The emotional moment when power was turned on for the impacted families--bringing tears of joy and renewed hope--is a testament to the profound difference this project made. WREC's participation in the ``Light Up Navajo'' initiative reflects not only their technical expertise but also their heart and respect for the people they serve. Their dedication has energized ten homesteads and countless lives, creating a legacy of service that embodies the true spirit of cooperative values. The WREC team's journey inspires us all, proving that with compassion and teamwork, even the most daunting challenges can be overcome to light up lives and communities. I commend the entire team for their efforts on this worthwhile endeavor and for their ongoing service to our local community."
"I rise to recognize the amazing James Brown III of Wilson, North Carolina, for not just one but two remarkable achievements. James is graduating as the valedictorian of his class at Wilson Preparatory Academy, and if that is not enough, he is doing so with perfect attendance that dates all the way back to kindergarten--yes, kindergarten. Using his words, James said: ``I promised my grandmother that I would do well in school, and that is what I am going to do.'' His late grandmother, Annie Pitt, would be so proud of James, as we all are. I thank James for keeping his promise to his grandma. He has earned the title of the hardest working student in eastern North Carolina's class of 2025. I congratulate the entire class. As I think about your future, ``I feel good.'' Now, James, keep making Grandma Annie proud."
"Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in today's debate and to reiterate our government's plan outlining oru immediate priorities to make life affordable for all Canadians, including Quebeckers. I want to thank the voters of Les Pays-d'en-Haut for placing their trust in me. As a member from Quebec, I think it is important for some of my colleagues from another political party to remember that Quebeckers elected 44 Liberal members to the House of Commons. This is a historic accomplishment because it is the highest number of Liberals elected to the House since 1980 and, I should point out, it is twice the number of Bloc Québécois members elected to the House. Quebeckers have quite simply given this government a strong mandate to fight unjustified tariffs, build a strong economy and make life more affordable. We also know that protecting the environment and economic growth are important priorities for Quebeckers. Instead of seeing those noble objectives as mutually exclusive, Quebeckers have long understood that they go hand in hand. Quebec has in fact long been a leader in fighting climate change. In 2013, Quebec established its own cap-and-trade system in order to set a price on carbon pollution. Quebec controls the design of the system and all of its revenues, which is why Canada's carbon rebate never applied in Quebec and why Quebec never expected to receive a carbon rebate. Quebec's leadership in establishing a cap-and-trade system not only predates the federal carbon pricing, it also served as a model for other jurisdictions in North America. Its ties with California through the Western Climate Initiative show that provinces can take the initiative on innovative cross-border climate solutions. The government will always support provinces that take ambitious, innovative and responsible action to fight climate change, as Quebec did. That is why I find the Bloc Québécois motion a bit ironic. On this side of the House, we respect and appreciate the provinces and territories that have implemented their own climate policies and are aligned with our shared goal of fighting climate change. The existing system is a recognition of Quebec's unique leadership on this issue and its jurisdiction. The Bloc will surely agree with that. The rebates that applied to the federal carbon tax, which has now been cancelled, were sent to Canadians living in provinces that were part of the existing plan. Canadians in those provinces would have budgeted for that rebate, and the government decided to make things easier for them. It is important to understand how carbon pricing works. It does not apply in provinces like Quebec that have their own carbon pricing system. In provinces where the federal system applied, all proceeds from consumer carbon pricing were returned to the province in which they has been collected. In those provinces, Canadians paid the fuel tax up until a few weeks before the final rebate was sent out. They rightfully expected to receive the final carbon tax rebate in April. That is why the final Canada carbon rebate was issued as a transitional measure after the elimination of the consumer fuel tax. The payment was not a new benefit. It was the final instalment of a rebate for costs associated with the federal fuel tax. Quebec did not pay the federal carbon tax, so it did not receive the federal rebate. That makes perfect sense. This situation is not unique to Quebec. The carbon rebate system did not apply in British Columbia or the territories either. People in those provinces and territories were also not entitled to the rebate. This seems to me to be a relatively simple and straightforward premise. I have a lot of respect for my colleagues in the Bloc Québécois, especially when it comes to environmental issues. However, motions like this one seek to sow division where there is none. The federal government has respected Quebec's jurisdiction over cap and trade and has worked with Quebec on environmental issues and carbon pricing. However, the other side of this mutually beneficial relationship was simply that Quebeckers did not pay the federal carbon tax as a consumption tax. It makes no sense for refund cheques to be sent to Quebec households, since they were exempt from the system in the first place. Quebeckers want all of the parties in this House to unite, rather than focus on motions that sow discord. They have asked us to put aside our partisan differences and stand up for Quebec industries, Quebec workers and a strong Quebec economy as part of a strong and united Canadian economy."
This is effectively going to ban the spraying of organic manures in the coming months. Is the Secretary of State categorically ruling that out?
"The River Chess in Rickmansworth is one of the chalk streams that goes through my constituency. The volunteers at the Rickmansworth Waterways Trust are keeping our canal heritage alive, despite funding for the Canal & River Trust being cut. I believe the cut is short-sighted, because these waterways tackle water shortages, boost  biodiversity and protect 2,500 miles of national assets for a modest cost. Will the Minister rethink the funding cuts and back the Fund Britain's Waterways campaign, so that local champions like David Montague and his team at Batchworth lock are not left to sink or swim on their own?"
I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.
"In a bipartisan spirit, perhaps the Minister will allow me to relay a brief apology. I promised the Chair of the Defence Committee that I would explain why he and some of the Committee are not here, when ordinarily they would be. They are on an overseas trip directly related to defence business. It would help keep me honest if the Minister allowed me to place that on the record."
"Madam Chair, my colleague will be happy to learn that the public debt chart is a percentage of nominal GDP. If he looks at the last few years, more than a decade, he will see it is always around 1.5%. This is going to be—"
It's not in the AG report.
"It is nearly four years since Professor Sir Chris Whitty published his striking report on health in coastal communities. Covid inevitably delayed implementation, so will the Secretary of State look again at that report, deliver on the chief medical officer's recommendations and ensure that my constituents in Bridlington and The Wolds can access the health services that they need?"
I declare the motion carried.
"Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the member on his critic role. I look forward to working with him. Of course, the U.S. is an important trading partner, and discussions are happening at the highest levels."
"I rise today to sound the alarm on the economic harm President Trump's reckless tariff policies continue to cause across this country, especially in my district of western New York. Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, these tariffs are taxes, and they are being paid not by foreign governments or corporations but by working families and small businesses at home. Whether it is raw materials, auto parts, or everyday goods at the grocery store, these costs are being passed on directly to American consumers. Families struggling to put food on the table are now being squeezed from every angle by rising prices, unstable markets, and Republican policies that put politics over people. Mr. Speaker, whether you call it tariff roulette or a trade tug-of- war, it has created instability that has devastated communities across the country. In western New York we are already seeing the fallout. As a Representative for a northern border community, I can tell you firsthand, Mr. Speaker, that this trade war is hurting Americans. Annually, Canadians have a $1.1 billion economic impact in western New York. In our community, we have already seen a serious drop in Canadian visitors who for decades have driven across the border to support our local economy. This is happening all across America as well. It is hurting our economy, and it is devastating to the people who live in our great country. It is not pocket change. It is people's paychecks. Additionally, it goes beyond tourism. Canada is New York State's largest trading partner. New York exportsmore than $17 billion in goods and services across the border each year, supporting tens of thousands of jobs. Disrupting that trade through politically motivated tariffs puts those jobs at risk. That is not leadership. That is economic sabotage. Pair that with this President's big, ugly bill that guts healthcare, slashes food assistance, and throws millions off their insurance, and what we have got is a vise grip on the American people and our economy. We don't need chaos. We need common sense, and we need smart economic policy. We need stability and support for working families, not another round of trade retaliation disguised as strategy. We must reject this reckless approach and stand up for workers, small businesses, and families who are paying the price. In western New York and across this country, people are not pawns. Americans deserve better.  It is time to reject this billionaire's first agenda and fight for an economy that works for everyone.  Honoring Maternity Director Mary Ann Murphy"
"First, I would like to recognise Mr Roy Briggs, a world war two veteran who recently passed. Those of us on both sides of the House salute our greatest generation. As the Secretary of State said, we recently announced Op Valour, the veterans' support system, which is underpinned by PS50 million over three years, and I launched the north-west England pilot last week. This is an institutionally resilient system--it is not a sticking plaster--that will reform the system at the local, the regional and the national level. When we combine that with the covenant broadening from three Government Departments to 14 just on Saturday, that is a significant increase to both veterans' and armed forces community support."
"Madam Speaker, it has been a lost Liberal decade, and there has been nothing done by the Liberal government to build our military, our defence and the communities surrounding the border areas. I would like to know what the Liberal government has done over the last Liberal decade. There has been nothing that the Liberal government has put forward that can help the communities that are around our borders."
"I thank my hon. Friend for raising a serious case and a real tragedy, not just for the family of Gunner Beck but our entire armed forces. It needs to be a wake-up call, where we recognise that the behaviour within some of our services is unacceptable and that we need to make improvements. For that very reason we must continue to support the Armed Forces Commissioner Bill, because it will enable family members as well as those serving in uniform to raise genuine service welfare complaints with the commissioner. It will not solve every problem we have with the culture in our armed forces, but it provides a route for individuals to raise concerns outside the chain of command with an independent champion. My hon. Friend mentions a conversation she had with Gunner Beck's family, and I would be happy to meet my hon. Friend to discuss that to make sure that we properly learn the lessons that defence needs to learn. I am proud to come from a naval family and to say clearly from this Dispatch Box that the families of our armed forces matter. For the very first time, this Bill will give them a say and allow them to raise concerns.  Family members are a crucial element of the commissioner's remit, and we agree that the definition of a relevant family member should be subject to parliamentary debate and approval. The Liberal Democrat spokesperson, the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Helen Maguire), raised that point on Second Reading, and we support it. We are moving it from the negative procedure to the affirmative procedure, which will enable that discussion to take place. Lords amendment 7 is a technical amendment that is consequential on clause 3, and I invite the House to support it. Clause 3 amends section 340B of the Armed Forces Act 2006 to specify that a ""person"" rather than only an ""officer"" may decide whether a service complaint is admissible. This is an evolution of the way that the service complaints system has worked and is a prudent change to make."
"Mr. Speaker, the Liberal government will soon ban the sale of gas and diesel-powered vehicles in our country. Liberals want to force Canadians to buy electric vehicles. It does not matter that the Liberal plan will add $20,000 to the cost of a vehicle. It does not matter that Canada is one of the largest and coldest nations in the world. It does not matter that working Canadians rely on dependable vehicles to earn a living and provide for their families. It does not matter that we do not have the electrical generation or transmission capacity for their idea. It does not matter that EV sales in Canada are on the decline and that both General Motors and Ford have called for scrapping the ban. Canadians demand that the Prime Minister support farmers, tradespeople, energy field workers and their families, who require reliable transportation and must be allowed to choose their vehicles."
"Every French city with a population of more than 150,000 has a mass rapid transport system, yet over 30 UK cities or towns of that size still lack it. Research from Centre for Cities shows that poor connectivity holds back growth and productivity by limiting mobility. A key reason why we have so few is cost, because building a kilometre of track in the UK is twice as expensive as the European average. Can the Secretary of State set out what her Department is doing to bring down costs and help kickstart a tram-building revolution?"
"Madam Speaker, this new government is taking community safety very seriously. We have committed ourselves to bail reform for repeat violent offenders, for those who are involved in home invasions, auto theft, human smuggling and drug trafficking. However, let me be clear: The provinces and territories also have a critical role to play. I am glad to see that the Province of Ontario has taken some steps. We welcome Premier Ford's announcement to strengthen Ontario's bail system. I hope other provinces also follow suit—"
"Resuming debate, the hon. member for Brandon—Souris ."
Agreed. On division
"Road closures can be a blight on local businesses, local communities and footfall on the high street, and they are obviously affecting my hon. Friend's constituents. I am sorry to hear that the Scottish Government seem to have mismanaged these roadworks, and I hope they are listening today and get on with the job."
"I remind my hon. Friend that we have the strongest of bilateral defence relationships with Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq and Lebanon at this time, and they can rely on us."
"As a member of the RAF contingent of the armed forces parliamentary scheme under Wing Commander Basco Smith, may I take this opportunity to say that the application window is open for next season? If any Member has not applied to it, they should consider doing so. Recently, we visited Marham, the current home of the F-35s. Can the Minister update us on what steps have been taken to remove the risk of attack on centralised basing, and to continue to invest in alternative dispersal bases for our aircraft? While these additional frames are welcome, will the Minister confirm that they are being matched by concurrent investment in the training of pilots and additional crews in the advanced skillsets that will be required for these operations?"
"It is clearly in the best interests of Spain and Gibraltar for there to be a free flow of individuals backwards and forwards across the border. For UK citizens who fly into Spain or Gibraltar and hire a car to cross the border into Gibraltar or Spain, what checks will there be at the border? Clarity on that point would help."
"The Prime Minister failed today to answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Argyll, Bute and South Lochaber (Brendan O'Hara). Do the Government believe Israel is committing a genocide--yes or no?"
"I thank my hon. Friend from the east midlands. He has long been committed to these issues, and particularly to the difficult but vital work of ensuring that civil society in Israel and Palestine works on peace-building projects. I know that he was in the region recently, and I commend him for his approach. We hope to set out our approach to the international fund in due course, following the announcements of the Prime Minister. We want to make as full a contribution as we can to bringing peacemakers on both sides of this conflict together."
"Mr. Chair, I would remind my colleague again that over 60% of the main estimates are transfer payments to provinces and territories for the delivery of health care services and other aspects."
"Mr. Chair, we will always stand with forestry workers and defend the forestry sector. The Americans' current position hurts both Canadian and American businesses and increases the cost of wood products and homes in the United States. We will continue to work to resolve this issue with the Americans."
"Mr. Speaker, that was a great speech that captured the spirit of Canadians who sent us to the House to make sure that we deliver on some of the most important key things. The member mentioned labour, and I know that he was Minister of Labour at one point. He went across the country talking to workers, so he actually understands the importance of removing these barriers for workers. Maybe the member wants to expand on the benefits of removing these internal barriers across the country and the benefit that would have on workers, not just in his riding, but across Canada, in all our ridings, as well."
"Mr. Chair, time is flying, and there is another topic I would like to discuss. The minister must be familiar with Via Rail. Since October 11, 2024, its trains have been forced to slow down because of a dispute with Canadian National, or CN. Last December, the government asked CN to produce documents to justify its decision. Litigation made its way to the Superior Court. On April 23, the Superior Court ruling essentially said that it is not up to the court to rule on the matter. Rather, it is up to Transport Canada and the minister, who has all the powers to do so. Will the government resolve this situation soon?"
Will my hon. Friend give way?
"Mr. Speaker, Ayn Rand once wrote about the way that socialist societies work. On the one hand, they create so many regulations that everyone is in violation, but then, on the other hand, the government will give individuals a “get out of jail free” card if they have preference and benefit from crony capitalism. That is the way that socialism would work. This might be an area of agreement with the member. Does the member believe that we should just reduce those regulations and let everyone build those projects or that we should keep those regulations the way they are and no one should build those projects?"
The hon. member for Hamilton East—Stoney Creek.
The hon. member.
"Madam Speaker, there were multiple questions and points made by the member, and I congratulate him on his entry into the House of Commons. I will note that I am supporting this bill because I believe there is an urgency. I just believe that the Prime Minister's Office is going too far and is lacking transparency in its approach to the second part of the bill before us today. If the member would like to speak further about fisheries-related issues, I would be pleased to do so, as I represent a large portion of the Fraser River and some of the most important salmon stocks in all of Canada."
"Happy birthday, Mr Speaker. In my Stoke-on-Trent South constituency, businesses such as the Bestway Group, which owns Well healthcare in Meir Park, and Goodwin International in Newstead are keen to invest in rooftop solar, but they cannot get national grid connectivity. In the case of Well healthcare, it will have to wait until 2032. Meanwhile, residents in my village areas are frustrated at the growth of solar farms on agricultural land when there are acres of empty flat roofs on industrial estates. Will the Secretary of State meet me to discuss the many challenges and opportunities for transitioning to clean energy that businesses in my constituency face?"
"As a child, Sizewell was an important word to me, like Wylfa, Hunterston, Dungeness, Dounreay and Hinkley, because they were places where my father, based in Gateshead, went to work. Will the Secretary of State assure me that the announcement is part of bringing back those fantastic safe jobs, which are so important for Gateshead and the nuclear industry?"
"My hon. Friend asks characteristically searching questions, so let me send him the NATO criteria that were published alongside the pledge last week, and let him and his Committee, when they interrogate me on Wednesday afternoon, pursue any further questions that they might have."
Order. I remind Members to look at the question on the Order Paper and make sure that their supplementary question is related to it.
"Mr. Speaker, no, I would not agree with that. What I would instead add is that it is surprising for his leader, Pierre Poilievre, though I do not believe it would be the member's opinion, to unfortunately declare things such as that the Canadian dental care plan is a communist plan and to describe the school food program as a bureaucratic program, while it is a program that is going to help 400,000 school children in the years to come. I suppose, or hope at least, that this is not the view of the member, but it is certainly the view of Pierre Poilievre, and I would invite the member to have a conversation with his leader."
"Mr. Speaker, if the Liberal member wants to tell Canadians that car prices are not becoming more expensive, I will go with him. I will go with him door to door, and he can tell every household he wants to that cars are not getting more expensive. We all know they are. They are being pushed higher and higher out of the grasp of hard-working Canadians who used to be able to afford them. All the questions about technology and investment are not what this motion is about. The Liberal policy is not about investing in technology or improving the grid or giving more options to Canadians. It is about banning an entire category of vehicles that Canadians have proven they want to be able to buy, and Conservatives will always fight for their right to do so."
"Happy birthday, Mr Speaker. Only 20% of schools currently have solar panels. Brigstock Latham's primary in my constituency does not. That is why its year 5 pupils have written to me asking for panels on their roof. They tell me that this would cut their carbon footprint, reduce bills and help improve their education. One pupil wrote: ""We may be a small school, but we can be big sometimes."" Will my right hon. Friend support their inspiring campaign and perhaps visit these young community activists in my constituency?"
"Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues and I have been able to witness that the far right is alive and well in the Conservative Party and Pierre Poilievre today. Could the member share with the House his honest reflections about what residential schools were about?"
"Madam Chair, humility in politics is the best thing someone can have. I do not want to correct the member, but in fact the member should know that people in her riding can save up to $840 for a family with two incomes. This is great news, and I am sure she is going to put that in her householder."
"Madam Chair, we are targeting the fall."
"I can confirm that it is absolutely the policy intent of the sponsor for that to be a backstop. The Government are working on that basis to ensure that it is a backstop and not a target. Amendment 42 seeks to remove the four-year backstop. Although that is a matter for Members to decide, we note that if both that amendment and amendment 94, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Spen Valley,  were accepted, nobody would have the power to commence reserve provisions in Wales. That would create major workability concerns for the service in Wales."
"Mr. Speaker, Ottawa just announced $9 billion in new defence spending starting this year. In the current global context, the Bloc Québécois agrees that we must invest in defence, but that is another $9 billion that the Liberals are asking us to blindly support without a budget or even an economic update. No one will know how that spending will be financed or how big the deficit is at the time of voting. Could the Liberals finally do the responsible thing and show us the state of our public finances?"
"I missed the following votes, but had I been present, I would have voted: no on rollcall vote No. 302, motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 117, Andrew Hughes, to be Deputy Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. I missed the following votes, but had I been present, I would have voted no on rollcall vote No. 303, confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 117, Andrew Hughes, to be Deputy Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. I missed the following votes, but had I been present, I would have voted yes on rollcall vote No. 323, confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 138, Daniel Zimmerman, to be Assistant Secretary of Defense."
"Mr. Speaker, after telling Canadians to live in shipping containers, will the housing minister go home to his $2-million penthouse in Vancouver, his 11 acres in Tofino or his $5.6-million property in Squamish? The hypocritical minister is telling young Canadians stuck in their parents' basement that housing prices do not need to come down. Does he not see how arrogant and condescending that sounds from atop his Vancouver penthouse?"
"Mr. Chair, does the minister agree that Abbotsford plays a critical role in B.C.'s food security?"
"(The House divided on Motion No. 15, which was negatived on the following division:) Vote #29"
"I welcome the industrial strategy, but I want to push the Secretary of State on skills. Harrogate college often tells me that it struggles to access funding for technical and vocational training that meets the needs of local business. In the next academic year--in just a couple of months--it will face a PS90,000 reduction in the devolved adult skills budget from the new Labour mayor. Will the Secretary of State clarify how the skills mission fund will work in practice for towns like mine, and whether it will be genuinely led by local economic need, not Westminster targets?"
"Mr. Chair, we will be able to provide that information to my colleague."
All material planning considerations that have been brought to the attention of the inspector will be taken into account as part of the decision when it is made in due course.
"Madam Speaker, that is such a wonderful question. From day one, when I heard that the Liberals are working on a single economy, I had questions like the member has. Until and unless the Liberals put down a plan or make clear what they mean by “single economy”, we are not going to support that. The real challenge or force that we can put forward to fight against Trump is making the economy stronger, making the micro-economy stronger, making the national economy stronger and making sure that our infrastructure is such that we can send our oil and gas out to other markets. We are not dependent just upon America for that."
"I wish to thank veterans for their service, and their families for the sacrifices that enabled it. As it is Volunteers Week, may I place on record my thanks and those of the whole House to the volunteers who do so much for our military charities? I welcome the announcement of the new programme, Valour, which is giving veterans across the UK easier access to essential care and support. The Minister for Veterans and People is leading work across the UK Government to ensure that veterans and their families have sufficient access to health services, housing, employment and other forms of support."
"Only the Conservatives could come here and defend Thames Water. The rest of the country has seen what an appalling performance this company has given during the 35 years since privatisation. I think it is time we put this company out of its misery, but we must do so in a way that does not bring the debts it has run up on to the taxpayer or the bill payers. Can my right hon. Friend say whether one of his options is preparing for that eventuality?"
"I declare the motion carried. The question is on Motion No. 9. A vote on this motion also applies to Motion No. 16. If a member participating in person wishes that the motion be carried or carried on division, or if a member of a recognized party participating in person wishes to request a recorded division, I would invite them to rise and indicate it to the Chair. The chief government whip."
"If a member participating in person wishes that the motion be carried or carried on division, or if a member of a recognized party participating in person wishes to request a recorded division, I would invite them to rise and indicate it to the Chair."
"Madam Speaker, the Conservatives might have had two or three more members speak than on the Liberal side today, but they are all speaking from the same script. Different members stand up and speak, but if the core of their principled speeches is being fed to them from the back room, there are some issues with that, too."
I commend my right hon. Friend on his length of service to this House.
"I look forward to seeing that business case when it comes forward, and I will of course be happy to discuss it with the hon. Member at the appropriate time."
"Mr. Chair, the plan that we tabled is that, by the end of 2027, we will decrease—"
"Mr. Chair, I am very familiar with those estimates, and yes, I agree."
"Uqaqtittiji , I congratulate the member on his re-election. I did enjoy working with him at INAN. While his is such a good question regarding culturally appropriate services, I think the first thing that needs to happen is, at the very least, for basic services to be provided. As I mentioned in my speech, Nunavummiut are forced to leave. It makes it more difficult for Nunavummiut, for northerners, to be engaged in Arctic sovereignty and Arctic security if they have no choice but to leave for basic medical care. Nunavummiut need to have access to safe, affordable, comfortable homes. Too many families are living in overcrowded housing conditions. Too many families are living in mouldy conditions. While to try to reach that next level of culturally appropriate care is appreciated, I think we need to get back to the basics and make sure the basics are invested in."
"Mr. Speaker, members of Canada's Building Trades Unions are here in Ottawa this week. They represent thousands of workers who are building Canada strong. Can the Secretary of State for Labour please update the House on what this government is doing to support these very important construction workers and the unionized labour across this great country?"
"Mr. Speaker, I find it fascinating to watch the Liberals and Conservatives duke it out over which of the two is more pro-oil and which of the two wants pipelines built the most. My question for my Conservative colleague following her speech is the following. In light of this sort of transformation of the Liberal Party into the Conservative Party 2.0, does she get the impression that she is losing her purpose given that the Liberals are doing the work that the Conservatives want to do themselves?"
"When this Government took office, we inherited a PS22 billion black hole, which required emergency action. We said at the time that our decision on the winter fuel payment was a difficult one that we did not want to make, and we are very pleased to be in a position to reconsider it."
"I thank the Chair of the Environmental Audit Committee for introducing the report and for mentioning bottom trawling. My understanding from speaking to the fish producers' organisations in my constituency and across Northern Ireland is that they are committed to the vision of stopping bottom trawling, and I think the feeling is the same across the whole United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. If our fishermen and fisherwomen have the vision to stop bottom trawling, what is being done to ensure that other European countries have the same vision?"
"Madam Speaker, we have watched the party opposite vote against every one of our initiatives that have helped families across the country from coast to coast to coast, whether it be the Canada child benefit, the dental program, the day care program or housing initiatives. The party opposite has not done one thing to support families across the country, so shame on them."
"moved: That Bill C-5, in Clause 4, be amended by replacing line 5 on page 12 with the following: (c) detailed cost estimates that do not include private sector commercially sensitive financial information; and"
"I am sorry to hear that the testing facility in my hon. Friend's constituency closed under the last Government, despite their previous commitments to it. He will be aware that we will soon set out the 10-year NHS strategy, and as part of that I am sure that my hon. Friend will want to put those kinds of questions to the Secretary of State."
What steps her Department is taking to help reduce reoffending by young offenders
"Mr. Speaker, let us flash back to the day the member is referring to. We had Conservative member after Conservative member giving the false impression that mail would be easily violated by a letter carrier or someone sorting at the mail office and so forth. It is all part of that fear factor that the Conservatives like to do. The reality is that it is not as simple as the Conservative Party tries to portray it. There are checks that are put into place to ensure that the privacy of the individual is there. The legislation would enable a law enforcement officer to get a general warrant so they can actually open a letter while it is between destinations."
"Mr. Speaker, the hon. member just said something very interesting, which is that the Liberals are going to table a budget in the fall so they have the right figures. Do they not have the right figures to table a budget now? Does that make any sense?"
"Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the speech by my colleague across the way. I would like to welcome him to the House of Commons, because I know this is his first time sitting here. I want to ask him the same question I asked his colleague earlier. Canadians have spoken in the recent election and have given the government a mandate to address affordability. Affordability must be a priority, especially for young people, like my colleague, and for Canadian families who aspire to buy their first home or access affordable child care. In addition, there are the many Canadian seniors, particularly those in Quebec, who want access to our dental care plan. Can my colleague tell us what he heard while going door to door during the election campaign? How will he be able to—"
"Mr. Speaker, instead of talking down Canada, the member should be elbows up with us. This is about making sure that as a chamber, the House stands united. This is about our nation. We are fighting a trade war. Everyone in this House has a responsibility to fight for Canadian workers, fight for Canadian industry and build Canada strong. We get it on this side of the House. I hope on the other side they get it, because Canadians at home get it."
"Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House, we believe in technology, not taxes, as a way to fight climate change. I have worked with many companies in Niagara in the green tech sector that are creating new technologies rather than collecting taxes that change nothing and do not reduce CO2 emissions. Yes, we have opportunities in this country to help grow our tech sector with these brand new companies that will change the world based on technology and not taxes."
"The right hon. Gentleman mentions a problem that I think is central to the situation that we have inherited. That is why, as I mentioned in response to the right hon. Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Holden), we are changing the way that DWP acts, so that we serve employers better and match people who actually want to move into those jobs. If the right hon. Gentleman would allow me, I will connect him with his local jobcentre manager, so that he can link up the businesses he mentions."
"I thank the Chair of the Select Committee for his statement. It has been a privilege to be involved in the Committee's work on this report. Does he agree that next week's UN ocean conference offers the Government a unique opportunity to take a global lead on banning destructive practices such as bottom trawling in marine protected areas, as our report recommends?"
"I will happily give way, although I promised Madam Deputy Speaker that I was about to turn to new clause 15."
"Transferring from legacy benefits to universal credit seems to be overly complicated, and makes it difficult for my constituents not to find themselves in debt. As an MP, I feel that my hands are tied. We are seeing constituents coming forward with rent arrears and in very difficult situations. May we have a statement from the Department for Work and Pensions on what is being done to make the transfer easier? I am concerned that people are falling into deep poverty and facing civil actions in the absence of better Government support."
"Mr. Speaker, I do not quite fully understand the interjection. I think what the member wanted to ask was in regards to a unanimous motion that passed the National Assembly of Quebec. I am being completely honest when I say that I am very passionate about the province of Quebec. I care about Quebec, and I will always advocate for Quebec. There were times in the Manitoba Legislature when a unanimous motion passed that Ottawa did not necessarily take into consideration to the degree that MLAs wanted in Manitoba. That is a part of being a part of a federalist system. At the end of the day, we can do so much better if we all work together to build a stronger, healthier country. As the Prime Minister says, we can be the strongest, healthiest country in the G7 if we work together."
"Mr. Chair, as the Prime Minister said, today we are talking about laws. We are talking about conditions that will allow us to—"
"My constituent Caitlin was coerced into signing a joint lease with her abuser just four days before he was arrested on charges relating to domestic violence. He was convicted, but she is still trapped in the lease for a property that she has never lived in and she is liable for rent that he refuses to pay. The estate agents tell us that they have a legal responsibility to chase rent arrears. Survivors in Caitlin's position are unable to fully move on from their abuse,  even after justice has been done in the courts. Will the Leader of the House help me to arrange a meeting with the Minister for Safeguarding to discuss a legislative solution to this problem and better support for survivors of domestic violence?"
"I rise today to recognize a major milestone for American manufacturing for New York's southern tier. Alstom, a global leader in smart and sustainable mobility, has opened its new, cutting-edge plant 4 facility in Hornell, New York. This 135,000-square-foot expansion brings stainless steel railcar body production back to the United States, strengthening our domestic supply chain, and reaffirming Hornell's position as the Nation's premier center for passenger train manufacturing. Plant 4 isn't just a facility. It is a symbol of what investment in American industry looks like. It will retain 390 good-paying jobs locally and create 258 new ones for families across my district. These are high-quality, high-tech jobs that provide economic stability and opportunity for the hardworking people of the southern tier. Production will soon begin on 200 multilevel commuter railcars for Chicago's Metra system, proof that what is built in Hornell rolls across the Nation. This project is a powerful example of how we strengthen our economy by investing in our communities, empowering our workforce, and leading the way in advanced manufacturing. I commend Alstom for their continued commitment to Hornell and thank the skilled men and women who are driving this legacy forward."
"Yesterday I visited the Refugee Council, which is proudly headquartered in my constituency. From supporting those fleeing for their lives to finding employment for them, it is helping people rebuild and become part of the community in Stratford and Bow. The constituency is also home to other excellent organisations that support refugees, such as the Refugee and Migrant Forum of Essex and London, Praxis and the Magpie Project--to name but a few. Both Tower Hamlets and Newham are sanctuary boroughs, and Newham is home to London's largest Ukrainian population. Would the Leader of the House join me in celebrating Refugee Week and recognising the valuable contribution made by these groups and others across the UK in supporting refugees to integrate into communities and play their part in national life in Britain, which they can now proudly call home?"
"I am most grateful to the hon. Member for Blyth and Ashington (Ian Lavery) for bringing this debate on banking before the House. I think bank closures affect every single constituency and every single person in the country, as we will hear throughout this debate. The final two banks in the town of Wetherby closed literally last month, but we were lucky, in the sense that we knew those closures were coming. I was working with the banks to get a banking hub in for a couple of years, and it has been in place in the town hall. This has given a huge advantage to the town of Wetherby, because the banks that had closed in the past are now represented again in that banking hub. Now that those last two branches have closed, the hub is going to take up residence in one of those ex-banks. That goes to show that if we can get a banking hub, we have the ability to bring things back to the community. The banks that have closed will have a representative in there on different days of the week, and as the hon. Member for Blyth and Ashington pointed out, it is vital that people are able to have that face-to-face interaction. However, in other towns in my constituency--such as Boroughbridge and Tadcaster, which have a huge number of businesses--there is no banking, and there is no banking hub. The residents of those towns have been told that they are close enough to go to other areas, but  as has been pointed out, that is not always the easiest thing to do. Then we come to Easingwold, at the further end of my constituency. Nationwide, with its policy of not shutting banks, still has its branch open, so Easingwold does not qualify for a banking hub. People are told that they have to go to Thirsk, a major town that is not easy to get to. As the hon. Member for Blyth and Ashington outlined, there is a problem with the excuse that not enough people are using branches and therefore the banks shut them down. When branches have been shut down in the past and I ask the banks, ""Can you please reconsider this?"", they say, ""Well, we only had a few people come in last week--we cannot keep it open,"" but they never actually do anything to encourage people to go to those branches. They never give an indication that the branch may be shut, and then they just shut it. Of course, people then miss the service, and the banks say, ""There is one close by in another area."" As has been described, people are being charged to withdraw their money from a cash machine. As the hon. Gentleman said about free cash, it is their money to start with, but when banks tell people that they have to get a bus to go to the bank, they are also charging people to get their money out. Everything we are discussing passes on the cost from the banks to the consumer, just to get their money out. I am lucky that I have a banking hub in my constituency. Other towns are going to need them--they do bring advantages--but the way that the whole high street industry of banking is operating is causing huge disadvantages to people. Ultimately, it is constantly charging them to get their own money out."
"Mr. Speaker, we know the value of the Canadian seafood industry, particularly in our home region of Atlantic Canada. The Prime Minister has been very clear. He had a very constructive conversation with the premier of China. We are going to be regularizing communication with the Chinese government. However, the member needs to also understand the geopolitics involved because the seafood industry also benefits from exports into the United States. This is an important conversation that the Prime Minister is having at the G7 summit right now. At the end of the day, this is a difficult situation because the U.S. government is also very hawkish on China. Any pathway we move forward on has to be measured against finding a balance with the Canada-U.S. relationship, in a continental sense, while also engaging constructively with the Chinese government to make sure we can continue to move our seafood products and our agriculture products to the world. Our government is committed to making that happen."
"Mr. Speaker, I respect the mandate that the people of Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie gave me, which is to defend their interests, good jobs, the environment and the rights of indigenous peoples. That is what I am doing here today. The second thing I would like to say is that this bill does something absolutely unprecedented and extraordinary. It allows projects of national interest to not comply with existing federal laws, especially environmental protection laws. Équiterre is clear on this: Schedule 2...identifies which laws the government may choose to ignore, such as the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, the Species at Risk Act, the Metal and Diamond Mining Effluent Regulations and the Marine Mammal Regulations. Schedule 2 to Bill C‑5 makes it possible to circumvent federal environmental protection laws. What is going on here?"
"I rise at a late hour with few folks on the floor to talk about the most serious issue we could ever talk about on the floor of the U.S. Senate: the prospect that America may soon be in a war. There is no part of the Constitution that is more important than the article I provisions making claim that the United States should not be at war without a vote of Congress. Yet the news of the day suggests that we are potentially on the verge of a war with Iran. When I was elected to the Senate in 2012, having served as a Governor from 2006 to 2010 during a tremendous upsurge in the two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, I visited our troops multiple times in the Green Zone in Baghdad and in Afghanistan. I went to the deployments and the homecomings; I went to the wakes and funerals, and I told myself when I came to the Senate that, if I ever had the chance to stop this Nation from getting into an unnecessary war, I would do everything I could to stop us from getting into an unnecessary war. I happen to believe that the United States engaging in a war against Iran--a third war in the Middle East since 2001--would be a catastrophic blunder for this country.  I think there are some in this body who have a different point of view than I on this point, but I think we should all be able to agree in the fundamental constitutional principle that says we shouldn't be in a war if Congress doesn't have the guts to debate it and vote on it; that we should all, in having taken an oath to the Constitution, at least support the principle that war is something that should be for Congress to declare. Just recently--right before I walked on the floor--the New York Times published this article, and I am just going to read this to demonstrate the imminence of the threat that this country faces. The article from the New York Times, dated today, reads ``Iran is Preparing Missiles for Possible Retaliatory Strikes on U.S. Bases, Officials Say,'' and I will just read the first few paragraphs.  Iran has prepared missiles and other military equipment for strikes on U.S. bases in the Middle East should the United States join Israel's war against the country, according to American officials who have reviewed intelligence reports. Fears of a wider war are growing among American officials as Israel presses the White House to intervene in its conflict with Iran. If the United States joins the Israeli campaign and strikes Fordo, a key Iranian nuclear facility, the Iranian-backed Houthi militia will almost certainly resume striking ships in the Red Sea, the officials said. They added that pro-Iranian militias in Iraq and Syria would probably try to attack U.S. bases there. Other officials said that in the event of an attack, Iran could begin to mine the Strait of Hormuz, a tactic meant to pin American warships in the Persian Gulf. Commanders put American troops on high alert at military bases throughout the region, including in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The United States has more than 40,000 troops deployed in the Middle East.  I met the father of an Apache helicopter pilot currently deployed in Syria yesterday. Finally, from the article:  Two Iranian officials have acknowledged that the country would attack U.S. bases in the Middle East, starting with those in Iraq, if the United States joined Israel's war.  We stand tonight as close to the potential initiation of a third war in the Middle East--the United States against Iran--as we have been during my time in the Senate. So, yesterday morning, when the Senate came into session, I announced and then I followed up with a filing of a War Powers Resolution in this body--a privileged resolution--that, by my clock, will mature and be subject to a vote on this floor because of its privileged status a week from Thursday. Ten days from the filing of such a motion, even by a single Senator, the Senate is required to take this matter up for an up-or-down floor vote about whether or not war should happen without a vote of Congress. A little bit about the Constitution. Many in here have heard me speak about this over the years about the Constitution. The Framers of the Constitution grappled with the question about how wars should begin, and they grappled with the question in a most unusual way. In the Constitution of 1787, the article I power is the congressional, the legislative power, and the article II power is the executive power. The Framers of the Constitution split war powers into a legislative responsibility and an executive responsibility. The legislative responsibility is clear: Congress declares war. It is in article I. The executive responsibility is to be the Commander in Chief. Once Congress--535 people--has declared war, you don't need 535 Commanders in Chief. That would lead to chaos. So a war once declared by a debate and vote by the people's elected body then gets handed to the President, who as Commander in Chief is responsible for executing on that declaration. The Framers of the Constitution did understand one thing about the President's power, which is the President as Commander in Chief should defend the Nation. The President always has the ability to defend the United States without asking Congress's permission. Back in 1787, Congress might adjourn and ride horseback back to Vermont. What if the United States were attacked? You couldn't wait for all of Congress to come back to enable the United States to defend itself. So a President has the inherent power under article II to defend the United States without asking for permission. But it has been the understanding since the very beginning of this Republic that, if it is more than defending the United States--if it is going on offense in anyway--congressional authorization is needed. It is so rare. In other countries and at other times, war has been for the Executive. It has been for the King. It has been for the Emperor. It has been for the Monarch. It has been for the Czar. It has been for the Sultan. But in the United States, we made a very careful choice to do it differently, and that choice was described most eloquently in a letter from the main drafter of the Constitution James Madison to President Thomas Jefferson. Actually, he was not yet President. This letter was dated April 2, 1798, and James Madison described what were they getting at when they vested the power to declare war with Congress. Here is what James Madison wrote:  The constitution supposes, what the History of all Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it. [Our Constitution] has accordingly with studied care, vested the question of war in the Legislature.  Other countries don't do this, but the Framers of our Constitution in 1787 decided we are going to be different. Before we send troops into harm's way where they could be killed, where they could be injured, where they could see people they love and their colleagues killed and injured--before we are going to send troops in harm's way in war, we want to see the people's elected bodies--both Houses--have a debate about what the stakes are and whether we should force our troops into harm's way and potentially lose their lives, and that debate will be in full view of the American public so the American public can understand what is at stake, and then they can call their Representatives or write them a letter and tell them what they think about whether war is necessary and whether the sacrifice we ask of our troops should be the ultimate sacrifice that we are often asking of them in war. That has been the Constitution since 1787. The Constitution has been amended, probably, in 25 or 26 amendments now. That has never been amended. That has never been amended. In 1974, Congress grappled with a challenging problem and passed the War Powers Resolution of 1974. What was the problem? The problem in 1974 was this: A President began war without telling Congress. In 1974, we were in the midst of the Vietnam war. Congress did know that, and Congress had passed some legislation at least appropriating funds for it and somewhat authorizing it during the Johnson administration. Congress knew about the war in Vietnam. Obviously, there was a draft, and 56,000 Americans were killed in that war. But President Nixon, without informing Congress, extended the war and started bombing Cambodia--it was called the secret bombing of Cambodia--a new country that had not been covered by war authorizations. So Congress stepped up and acted and passed the War Powers Resolution of 1974. That resolution did a number of things. It established some protocols for when the President initiates military action, providing notice to Congress so that there can't be a secret war; giving Congress some ability, once notice is provided, to try to withdraw notice if it thinks that the war is ill-advised. But the War Powers Resolution also did something else: It gave the power to even one Member of Congress, one Senator or one House Member, if a President initiates war or is on the verge of initiating war--the War Powers Resolution gave to one Senator, one Congressman, the ability to file a resolution to stop a war before it starts or to stop a war once it started. The War Powers Resolution over time has made that a privileged motion, meaning it can bypass committee and be brought up on the floor of the Senate for a vote within an expeditious period of time. A privileged motion is one that sort of elbows everything else out of the way because Congress has judged that the matter is so important that it should take precedence over normal committee proceedings and it should be considered in a prompt fashion. It is a simple majority vote, not subject to filibuster and cloture. It can't be buried in a committee. It has to be debated on the floor. It is amendable. It can be amended. But as long as you meet the criteria, the privileged criteria, under the War Powers Resolution of 1974, you are entitled to try to stop a war before it starts. The criteria that you have to meet to have the privilege are two: One, hostilities between the United States and another actor nation-- Iran in this case--have to either be underway or they have to be imminent. That has to be the case. You can't just say: I want to stop a war that no one has contemplated and nothing is happening. So you have to demonstrate imminence. You also have to show that there is no existing congressional authorization authorizing the United States to be at war--in this case, with Iran. That second criteria has been met. We had a similar resolution on the floor a few years ago following the U.S strike that killed the Iranian military leader Soleimani, and the ruling of the Parliamentarian and really the acknowledgement of the body was that there was no current congressional authorization authorizing war against Iran. So the question is, Is the imminence standard met? I would argue that it clearly is. The United States is already using U.S. weaponry to knock down Iranian missiles. That is more than imminence; that is actual kinetic hostility. The United States is being urged to enter the war. The United States is moving military assets into the region and withdrawing diplomats from the region. The Iranians are acknowledging that: If the United States enters the war, we have plans to go after U.S. troops, the 40,000 U.S. troops in the area. Since Congress clearly wanted a Member to be able to file such a motion to be heard before a war begins, I believe the imminence standard is clearly met in this case with actual kinetic activity between U.S. weaponry and Iranians. So over the course of the next few days, you will likely hear me talk more than once about the need for Congress to stand up and say there shall not be a war against Iran without a congressional vote. It is a pretty simple proposition: No U.S. war against Iran without a congressional vote. Let me answer a couple of questions that colleagues of mine have asked about the resolution that I filed yesterday. First, what about self-defense? What about if Iran does take action against the United States, the homeland, or at a U.S. base in the Middle East or at a U.S. consulate in Erbil in the Kurdish area of Iraq? What if Iran takes action against the United States? The answer is pretty straightforward: Under the Constitution, the President can defend the United States, and the President doesn't need Congress to do that. So if there is an Iranian attack on the United States, the President can and has said he will--and I would strongly support him, as I know everyone in this body would--defend U.S. interests against an Iranian attack. So the self-defense question is mentioned in the resolution. The resolution says: Nothing in this resolution will block the ability of the United States to take legal action to defend itself, and that is clearly contemplated by article II. The second question I am asked is, What about the United States helping Israel defend itself? I have been here since January of 2013. I have voted for every Israel defense package that has ever been before this body, and there have been many. Israel receives more defense aid from the United States than any other nation year after year after year with my support. And I have done more than vote for Israel defense aid; on a couple of instances, I have whipped votes to make sure that we found enough aid for Israel. In April of last year, we passed a supplemental bill in this body that had billions of dollars of aid for Israel in the aftermath of the horrific attacks on Israel by Hamas on October 7. It was shortly after that vote that Iran launched a set of attacks against Israel. The defense aid that the United States provided enabled us to knock down and assist Israel in knocking down Iranian drones and missiles. That was a good thing. Had those drones andmissiles landed in Israel, they would have not only killed and wounded tons of civilians, but they would have led to escalation in the region that would have been unhelpful for all countries in the region. So I stand strong for Israel's right to defend itself, and I stand strong for the United States in providing Israel support so that they can defend themselves, but that is a different question. That is a different question than whether the United States should go to war with Iran. In my view, there is no compelling security reason for the United States to go to war with Iran. The last question that I want to ask and sort of reflect upon before concluding is this: What about diplomacy? What about diplomacy? The pages are here. You have a lot of time on the floor. Sometimes there are speeches, and sometimes there aren't, and I imagine you have looked a lot in this room and what is in the room. One of the things you have noticed is that in the panels--all around the room, the blue panels--at the top of the panel is the seal of the United States. That seal of the United States was designed and embraced by the United States in 1782. The seal of the United States is also in the skylight in the ceiling of the Senate Chamber, and that seal has essentially been constant since 1782. There is a seal of the President of the United States that has changed a little bit, but the seal of the United States that Congress has used has been constant since 1782. One thing that is very notable about the seal is the eagle and two claws holding the arrows of war and the olive branches of peace. But since the very beginning of this Republic, the eagle's face has been turned to the olive branches of peace. It was designed that way to send a symbol that the United States always prefers peace, always prefers diplomacy, and only uses war as a last resort when diplomacy fails. We had a diplomatic deal with Iran that was entered into in 2015 that was limiting their nuclear program--peacefully, without having to bomb them, without having to kill civilians, without having to assassinate scientists. The United States, together with other nations, used the power of congressional sanctions--Congress did this well--to leverage an agreement whereby Iran agreed--in the first sentence of the first paragraph of the first page of the agreement, Iran reaffirmed that it would ``never seek to purchase, acquire, or develop nuclear weapons.'' In the body of that agreement, Iran agreed to a whole series of limitations upon nuclear research, nuclear activity, centrifuge construction, and the percentage of enriched uranium it was allowed to have. Also, Iran agreed to the most comprehensive inspection regime of any nation on the planet, overseen by the International Atomic Energy Agency, to ensure that they were meeting their requirements that they would never seek to purchase, acquire, and develop nuclear weapons and that they would abide by their limits on centrifuges and the limits on enriched uranium and other activities. The agreement was working. Don't take it from Senator Kaine; the International Atomic Energy Association said the agreement was working. The allies and adversaries--Russia and China--were part of this deal, as were the UK and France and Germany. Those who worked on the deal said the agreement was working. It wasn't turning Iran from a bad actor to a good actor. It wasn't stopping all of Iran's bellicose behavior. But it was limiting the very nuclear program that is now trying to be bombed out of existence. We had an agreement that was working. President Trump became President in January of 2017, and he said: I don't like the agreement that President Obama did. I want to get out of it. President Trump's own Cabinet--his Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said: Don't get out of this agreement. It is working. His Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said: Don't get out of this agreement. It is working. His National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, a former general, said: Don't get out of this agreement. It is working. For God's sake, we have used diplomacy just as we are supposed to--by preferring peace and diplomacy first--to deprive Iran of a path to a nuclear weapon. Shouldn't we prefer diplomacy rather than putting at risk the lives of American troops, the 40,000 troops who are in the Middle East? So what happened to the diplomatic agreement? President Trump started to talk about abandoning it. I wrote a piece in Time magazine in 2017, and I said: If you abandon this agreement when it is working, what will Iran do? They will go back to developing nuclear weapons, because if the United States backs out of it, they will as well. If you abandon this agreement, North Korea will never do a nuclear deal with the United States because why do a deal with the United States if the United States is going to abandon the deal even when it is working? President Trump didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to his Secretary of State. He didn't listen to his Secretary of Defense. He didn't listen to a lot of people in his administration. He tore the deal up. What a tragedy. You have Israeli civilians who have been killed in the Iranian missile attacks who have nothing to do with the military and Iranian civilians who have been killed in missile attacks who have nothing to do with the military. They would be alive today and 40,000 U.S. troops in the region would be safe today if we had decided to act in accord with our values and put diplomacy first and put peace over war. That is water under the bridge. But the question for this body that we will grapple with over the course of the next couple of weeks is whether the United States should be in another war in the Middle East-- in particular, whether we should allow a war to start without us, whether we should hide in the tall grass rather than exercise our constitutional responsibility under article I. This is fundamentally a debate about Congress being true to its oath of office and actually also being true to the obligations we have to our public. The Framers put this in the Constitution so that we wouldn't be at war without a debate in front of the public. They had a view about the morality of war, and I think their view was basically this: There would be nothing more publicly immoral, in the public space, than to send troops into harm's way, risking death, if Congress was too chicken to have a debate and vote about whether the war was in the national interest. If we had that debate and we decide that war is in the national interest, then the troops go into war knowing that the civilian leadership of this country have had the hard debate in view of the American public and decided that the stakes are sufficient to ask people to make the ultimate sacrifice. But how dare we--how dare we--and I say this as the father of a U.S. marine: How dare we ask people to make the ultimate sacrifice if we don't have the guts to have a debate and decide whether a war is in the interest of this country? I know what the American public thinks about this. There was a poll that was released today, and this is completely consistent with what I have heard from Virginians. And Virginia is one of the most pro- military States in this country. I am on the Armed Services Committee. One out of every eight Virginians is a veteran. That is not one out of every eight adults; that is one out of every eight Virginians is a veteran--and you add Active Duty, you add the Guard, you add the Reserve, and you add the civilian DOD and the military contractors and their families. We train all the Marine officers in the world. We have the biggest shipbuilding enterprise in the world. We have the Pentagon, the largest military office in the world. We have been the site of more battles on U.S. soil than any State in this country, in Virginia: the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, the attack on 9/11 at the Pentagon. We are as pro-military a State as there is, but I can tell you this: Virginians do not believe the United States should be in another war in the Middle East. Neither do Americans. A poll today suggests 16 percent of Americans think the U.S. military should get involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran--one-sixth, 16 percent--60 percent say we should not; 24 percent are not sure. We need to have this debate in front of the American public and let themwatch us debate the stakes of this. And it might be that colleagues in this body or in the House think a war with Iran is a good idea. Let them put a war authorization on the table. Let's debate that. Let's debate that in front of Virginians and Kansans and Californians and hear what our constituents have to say. Let's debate that in the full view of people whose spouses are in the military or whose kids are in the military. Let's have that debate in front of them and hear what they think before we cast a vote that would be one of the most serious votes that you ever cast on the floor of a body like this. But we should not allow a war of the magnitude of this to begin with Congress hiding from the responsibility that was put on Congress's shoulders in 1787. I will be asking my colleagues to support my simple resolution as early as next week: No war without a vote of Congress. I will be asking my colleagues to support it and uphold the oath we have all taken to support the Constitution that established that most unusual principle, most unique principle, that is part of what makes this Nation special. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor."
"Mr. Chair, as I mentioned, to build an energy superpower, it must be low-risk, low-cost and low-carbon."
"My hon. Friend and I spoke just days ago about that issue. We are of course more than happy to continue engaging with and listening to the views proposed by hon. Members from across the House and by organisations. If he will allow me to make a little progress, I will deal specifically with the nature restoration fund in fairly short order. Let me begin with the improvements made to the consenting process for critical infrastructure. As set out in my written ministerial statement of 23 April, the Government have removed the overly prescriptive and burdensome statutory consultation requirements for major economic infrastructure projects that were unique to the NSIP system established by the Planning Act 2008.  Over this Parliament, that change could result in a cost-saving of over PS1 billion across the project pipeline. By speeding up delivery, increasing capacity and reducing constraint cost, it will also contribute to lower household bills. We have decided to proceed with the change because considerable evidence attests to the fact that the statutory requirements in place are driving perverse outcomes. Rather than providing a means by which engagement drives better outcomes, statutory pre-application procedures have become a tick-box exercise that encourages risk-aversion and gold-plating. The result is consultation fatigue and confusion for communities; longer, more technical and less accessible documentation; and an arrangement that actively disincentivises improvements to applications, even if they are in a local community's interests, because applicants worry that a further repeat consultation will be required. In removing the statutory requirement to consult as part of the pre-application stage for NSIP applications, and bringing requirements more closely in line with other planning regimes, the Government are not downgrading the importance of high-quality pre-submission consultation and engagement. We still want the NSIP regime to function on the basis of a front-loaded approach in which development proposals are thoroughly scoped and refined prior to being submitted to the Planning Inspectorate, and we still expect high-quality, early, meaningful and constructive engagement and consultation to take place with those affected as part of that process. Given that such engagement and consultation routinely takes place and leads to improved proposals in other planning regimes without such statutory requirements, and because the development consent order examination procedure rewards high-quality applications, we are confident that developers will continue to be incentivised to undertake it. To support that change, the Government intend to publish statutory guidance setting out strong expectations that developers undertake consultation and engagement prior to submitting an application. We will work with stakeholders to design that guidance--a public consultation will be launched in the coming months--so that it encourages best practice without recreating the flaws of the current system. We have also made a number of other changes relating to the nationally significant infrastructure project regime, including by amending the Bill to ensure that promoters can gain access to land to carry out surveys assessing its condition and status and inform environmental impact assessments, and to make the process for post-consent changes to development consent orders more proportionate to the change requested."
"Mr. Chair, we can clearly see here that the minister cannot answer any questions. This is another failed Liberal broken promise. I will move on to my next question. Ottawa has the most federal buildings in the country. However, the Liberal MP for Ottawa Centre stated that this program is not moving fast enough. If the minister's own colleague is criticizing this program, why would Canadians not criticize it? Does he have an answer for that?"
"Mr. Speaker, this bill was introduced two days ago, and we have had to analyze all 130 pages of it. At first glance, we are generally in favour of the bill in principle. However, given that it is 130 pages long, affects more than three departments and could possibly amend some 20 laws, I hope that the minister agrees with me that it will require thorough, detailed work in committee. There is no way that such a bill should be fast‑tracked; that would not make any sense. There are far too many clauses to consider, and we do not even know if some of them would stand up in court. I am going to test the minister. There are so many questions surrounding this bill, but there is one that must be raised. I am thinking in particular of the suggestion to remove the possibility of compelling the minister and members of his staff to appear before the Refugee Protection Division. Why was this included in the document presented by the minister today?"
"My most recent visit to the primary school was to roll out our free school meals policy. I was happy to do that by serving school meals myself--if all else fails, I've got a back-up. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. At a time like this, the House usually comes together and speaks with one voice, and we are the more powerful for it. President Zelensky has told me on a number of occasions how much that means for his people. In fairness to the Conservative party, it has always been resolute on Ukraine. The Leader of the Opposition needs to look again at her approach. At a time like this, the sooner we get back to the kind of cross-party unity that we had, the better. Our adversaries know that when they see unity here, that is much more of a problem for them than when they see unserious division."
"Almost 300 residents in West Lothian, which covers a large part of my constituency, and many others around the country will be affected by the shortage of galantamine  capsules, which are used to treat Alzheimer's. As a result of the shortage, local pharmacies are scrambling for provision, and some patients rely on twice-daily short shelf-life medication, which is more difficult to administer. Given the unique vulnerability of those with Alzheimer's, will the Leader of the House make time for a debate on the security of our medicine supply chains?"
Order. The hon. member must have a chance to respond. The hon. member for Lakeland.
"Madam Speaker, I will quickly read the Supreme Court decision in R. v. Comeau: The need to maintain balance embodied in the federalism principle supports an interpretation of s. 121 that prohibits laws directed at curtailing the passage of goods over interprovincial borders, but allows legislatures to pass laws to achieve other goals within their powers, even though the laws may have the incidental effect of impeding the passage of goods over interprovincial borders. Why am I reading the Supreme Court ruling? It is because the Supreme Court says there are barriers. It is true that Quebec introduced its own bill to break down some barriers. It is true that some regulations do create barriers. However, it is not true that every regulation adopted by a province's executive or legislature for a specific reason is a barrier, that it is its main purpose. Right now, what the Government of Canada is trying to do is indirectly grab all of the regulatory power that is needed at times to maintain and strengthen Quebeckers' vision for society, particularly when it comes to the environment."
"Mr. Chair, in this House, what we all want is to have no tariffs on Canadian industry or workers, because this is affecting our economy. It is affecting communities across the country—"
Call in the members. And the bells having rung:
"this bill represents a tiny fraction of the total we are spending annually. It is a tiny fraction, 0.2 percent, one-fifth of a percent of what President Biden added to the debt over the last 4 years. Yet, Democrats are saying that these savings are cruel. They literally said this will destroy America as we know it. No one outside of the beltway will take them seriously. Have my Democratic colleagues even looked at what is in this bill before attacking? Is it cruel to suggest that American taxpayers shouldn't have to pay $60,000 to celebrate DEI in the Netherlands or $30,000 to foster ``queer-feminist discourse'' in Albania? Is it cruel to cut a program spending $700,000 to expand fruit and jam sales in Honduras? By the way, speaking of jam, my last name is Smucker, but even I know that is a bad deal. Mr. Speaker, I can tell you what will destroy America as we know it, and that is this unsustainable debt that we are passing on to our kids and grandkids. I urge my colleagues to support this rescission package. Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman)."
"Mr. Chair, Canadians elected this government, a responsible government, to build the economy."
"I ask unanimous consent that the following motions to commit for the bill H.R. 1 be placed in the Congressional Record:  A motion to commit the bill H.R. 1 to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate with instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session, with changes that-- (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and (2) would ensure that any sales of public lands exclude-- (A) land deemed valuable for watershed health; (B) land used for, or suitable for, hunting, fishing, or recreation; (C) land with cultural or historic significance; (D) land with critical wildlife habitat; (E) land including areas sensitive for reasons relating to national security; (F) land within the limits of an Indian reservation; and (G) land over which federally recognized Indian Tribes retain reserved rights, including hunting, fishing, and gathering rights through a treaty, agreement, or Executive order.

"I am bringing before the Senate an opportunity for us to take a stand, to take a stand against the corruption of American foreign policy. The Senate will take a vote in just a moment to deny the President the ability to move forward with two arms sales--one to Qatar and one to the United Arab Emirates. I believe that this Senate should join Republicans and Democrats together in saying that any country that is willing to pay the President personally, to enrich our President personally, in order to receive favorable treatment from the United States of America in its foreign policy or to receive national security secrets from the United States of America shouldn't be able to do business as usual with this Congress or with this country. I want to tell you a story that is as heartbreaking as it is aggravating. We give the American President enormous power, and particularly we give the President enormous power when it comes to managing the foreign relations of this country. The President decides where we send arms. The President gets to negotiate peace treaties. The President decides how millions of troops are deployed all around the world. We trust that the President is going to use those powers for good, that the President is going to use those authorities to protect the United States of America. But they are vast powers. They are immense powers. So there is always the potential that those powers are going to be used for corrupt purposes, that instead of using those authorities in order to gain concessions from other nations that benefit the broad American public or benefit American national security, the President may use those powers in order to enrich himself personally. Our Founding Fathers actually thought a lot about this problem because they had watched their monarch. They had watched the King of England use the powers that he had in order--not to protect the British people but to amass enormous wealth. He used those powers both to control dissents and protests domestically, but he also used those powers in order to compel other nations and actors inside the empire to pay him tribute. President Trump has decided that he is going to use the powers that we have given him to demand the same kind of tribute that Kings and monarchs demanded. The reason we have to stand together today to vote against these arm sales to Qatar and UAE is because unfortunately these two countries, who are admittedly often allies, important allies of the United States, have decided to comply with President Trump's request to pay him that tribute. Shortly before the President went to the Middle East, he did not dispense to the region his Secretary of State. Instead, he dispensed to the region his business partners. Just before the President made his first major foreign trip to the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and to Qatar, he sent his son and their business partner--who, not coincidentally, happens to be the son of Trump's Middle East Envoy--to the United Arab Emirates. Their request was pretty simple. Their request was not that the UAE do something that would be in the interest of collective American security; their request was that the UAE invest $2 billion in Trump's new crypto business--in particular, his stablecoin venture. This is the President of the United States going to the UAE and asking a foreign government to invest $2 billion in his personal business. The company is called World Liberty Financial. On World Liberty Financial's website, it says the majority of the company is owned by Donald J. Trump. This was a pretty exceptional request to make because his crypto business was brand new. At the time, it was a pretty minor player. So a $2 billion investment from a country like UAE would vault World Liberty Financial into the stratosphere. And, in fact, itdid. When the UAE complied with that corrupt request, World Liberty Financial--the stablecoin that it issues became the fifth biggest stablecoin in the world overnight. Now, the UAE felt like it had to comply with the President's request because they had things they wanted from the United States. First, they wanted a continuation of arm sales, including the sale of Chinook helicopters that we will be voting on today. But they wanted something more specific, something that they weren't able to get from the first Trump administration or from the Biden administration. They wanted some of our most vital, most significant national security secrets. They wanted to be able to get their hands on computer chip technology, the kind of technology that will power the next generation of AI. We as a nation--again, based on bipartisan consensus--had been unwilling to give UAE that technology because it is a fairly open secret that the UAE has a very close, very cozy relationship with China, and there was a very real worry--there still is a real worry-- that that technology, if transferred to the UAE, would be quickly transferred to China, allowing China to be able to outpace us, to outrun us in the race to advanced AI. But the UAE knew that there was a way to get what they wanted, that there was a way to change the policy of the United States, and it was a $2 billion investment in Trump's business. Not coincidentally, just weeks after they announced they were putting $2 billion into Trump's crypto business, his father--who, again not coincidentally, is Trump's Middle East Envoy--went back to the region and announced that they would be moving forward with the transfer of these computer chips to the UAE--$2 billion into the Trump family's pockets and the most sensitive American technology that had been previously banned from going to the UAE, being sent to the UAE. Apparently, we didn't make any demands that the UAE divest itself from its security relationship with China. Instead, what we demanded was that the UAE make a $2 billion investment in Donald Trump's business. As you can imagine, once the word was out that the Trump administration was for sale, other countries decided to get into the mix. Donald Trump barely had taken a look at a luxury plane that the country of Qatar owned--reportedly the most luxurious plane in the world: gold plating, a spiral staircase designed by a famed French designer--and the President wanted it personally. So he dispensed the Department of Defense, apparently, to go to the Qataris and asked them to give him the plane, just like he had asked the UAE for a $2 billion investment in his business--a $2 billion investment that nobody else was going to give him except for a foreign power over which Donald Trump had leverage because of his role as President of the United States. He went to the Qataris and asked them to give him this jet because he liked it, because it was fancy, because he thought he deserved it, and he knew they couldn't say no. Why? Because the Qataris also have specific asks of the United States. More broadly, they were burned during Trump's first term. When the Saudis and the Emiratis ganged up on the Qataris and effectively implemented an economic and political blockade on Qatar, the Trump administration, in the first term, effectively took the side of the Emiratis and the Saudis. That was devastating for the Qataris. So first and foremost, they wanted to make sure that never again would Trump abandon them if there was a contest like that in the Middle East. So when he asked for the plane, just based upon their desire to make sure they did not get abandoned again, they felt they had to say yes. But they also wanted an arms sale, and the arms sale they wanted was a groundbreaking arms sale. Never before has the United States been willing to send our most sensitive drone technology into the Middle East, weren't willing to transfer our most sensitive computer chips. We also weren't willing to send our most sensitive drone technology. Qatar wanted that drone technology and once again, just like the UAE knew that they could get our most sensitive computer chip technology if they sent $2 billion to Donald Trump's business ventures, Qatar, having learned that lesson, realized that if they gave a massive gift to the President, maybe he would break with a bipartisan precedent not to send this sensitive drone technology into the Middle East. Guess what. They got what they wanted. The President has agreed to move forward with sending our most sensitive drone technology, the Predator drones, into the Middle East, selling them to Qatar. It is not a coincidence that they are also willing to send him this jet. I had the chance this morning to talk to the Secretary of Defense about this jet because one of the claims the administration has made is that the jet is actually being sent to the U.S. Government. But we learned some important facts this morning. It is true that right now the U.S. Government is buying two new Air Force Ones, and it is true that this contract is expensive and it is taking a little bit longer than both Republicans and Democrats had hoped, but both those planes from Boeing are due for delivery sometime at the end of Trump's term. What we learned today is that this plane that is being gifted temporarily to the U.S. Government is going to take several years to retrofit and will become available essentially at the exact same time that the two Boeing planes are made available. So we don't actually need this plane as a new Air Force One because the Boeings are still under contract, and they are going to be ready simultaneously. But the Secretary of Defense is committed to accepting the gift of this plane and then spending upwards of $1 billion of taxpayer money in order to retrofit this plane--$1 billion that we don't need because we are already spending $4 billion on the two Boeings. So now, instead of having two Air Force Ones, we are going to have three Air Force Ones. We don't need three Air Force Ones. But Trump is solving this problem because what he has said is that, when he leaves office, he is taking this Air Force One with him. Now, that has never ever happened before. We have never just given a President of the United States a gift on the way out the door. But we are going to spend $1 billion getting this plane ready. It, effectively, will not be used as an actual Air Force One because it won't be completed until the very end of his term. And then Trump is taking the plane, apparently, to his Presidential library, but who knows. And so this gift is actually going to Donald Trump, not to the American taxpayers. The Department of Defense is, effectively, a straw purchaser. It will hold the plane for a couple years; it will spend your taxpayer dollars to retrofit the plane; and then the plane will just be given to Donald Trump to take with him in his post-Presidency. So $2 billion from the UAE into the President's crypto venture, a plane that, when all is said and done, is probably going to be worth about $1.5 billion, straight transferred to Donald Trump personally-- this is unprecedented in the history of the United States of America. Never has a President of the United States, while in office, solicited, sought, and accepted billions of dollars' worth of investments in his private companies or gifts to him and his family. Remember, our Founding Fathers thought about this problem. They worried about this exact situation: a President using the vast power of the article II authorities he is given in order to trade favorable American treatment for foreign countries in exchange for personal enrichment of the President. They literally wrote a clause into the Constitution which, clear as day, says that a President of the United States cannot accept gifts from a foreign Prince, King, or nation. That is exactly what the President is doing. This plane is a gift. He advertises it as a gift--a gift that will be in the American public's hands for a nanosecond before it goes into his private hands. If we don't take a stand, if we don't act together against this unconstitutional corruption of our foreign policy, I don't know that we can ever get this genie back in the bottle. I understand that it is difficult for my Republican colleagues to stand up to this President, but we have an independent responsibility, as a coequal branch of government charged with upholding the Constitution, to call outwrong when we see it, to call out illegality when we see it. This is wildly unconstitutional. This is wildly illegal. So we have a chance today, with these resolutions, in order to make clear that we are not going to accept or make normal this kind of corruption of American foreign policy. Now, Mr. President, I will finish with this because my colleague from Maryland is going to add some remarks. I admit that these are imperfect vehicles. It is all part of the same story. Trump would not be moving forward with these arms sales if he wasn't getting what he wanted personally from these two countries. But I also admit that the UAE and, most especially, Qatar have been allies of the United States. We have worked together in our efforts, for instance, to combat terrorism in the region. Qatar specifically has, at times, been a heroic partner of the United States. We would never have been able to rescue thousands of Americans and American allies from Afghanistan without Qatar's help. Qatar has consistently acted as an interlocutor between warring and conflicting factions in the region. Qatar has taken risks on behalf of the United States. We, of course, have thousands of American troops and soldiers and airmen in Qatar today. And so what we need to say here is not that we are going to permanently pause our military relationships with these countries, but for the time being, while these two nations are willing to pay the President tribute, we cannot endorse or condone business as usual. These are important partners of the United States in the region. They will be important partners in the future. But this is an exceptional moment where the corruption and our effort to stop the corruption has to take priority and has to take precedent. And so I am going to vote for both of these resolutions while also still believing that we are going to have a continued, important bilateral relationship with Qatar and with the UAE. But if we start to endorse and grease the wheels of this kind of corruption, then there will be no end because once it becomes accepted, once it becomes implicitly endorsed by the U.S. Senate that foreign governments can put money into the personal treasury of the President in order to gain favorable treatment from the United States of America, that becomes the way our foreign policy works. So I appreciate my colleagues' time and attention to this matter, and I encourage them to support these motions when they come up for a vote later this afternoon. I yield the floor."
"I am sure my hon. Friend will be pleased to know that we have launched 81 criminal investigations into water companies for pollution and other failings--a dramatic increase on what we inherited from the previous Government. I am sure he will recall that they cut the resources to the regulator in half. Despite the appalling financial inheritance, we increased resources by 9% at the Budget and we have now introduced the polluter pays principle, so that where there is a successful prosecution of a water company, that company will pay the price of the investigation, so that further investigations and prosecutions can follow."
"June is Gypsy, Roma and Traveller History Month, celebrating the colourful histories and contributions of those communities. People are drawn to Glastonbury and Somerton as a place of pilgrimage, because of its unique spiritual heritage. After the Conservative cuts, we have no sites across Somerset for our Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller communities. Can we have a debate in Government time on support for the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller community?"
"My hon. Friend is completely right. As I say, we have set the threshold at a level that means that the vast majority of pensioners--not just in her constituency, but right across England and Wales--will receive support in the coming winter. Importantly, we are announcing the threshold now, to make sure those payments can be made in time for this winter."
The hon. member has to indicate how he will be sharing his time.
"I rise to congratulate Greg Parker on being named 2025 Retailer Executive of the Year by Convenience Store News. Greg, the founder and CEO of Parker's Kitchen, has grown his business from one store in 1976 to his 100th in a grand opening in April of 2025. His brand has become a role model in business, being synonymously described as clean, friendly, profitable, and philanthropic. Greg exhibits the best characteristics of this award. He is a leader. He positively impacts his community, and he strives for business excellence. He is often recognized for his significant philanthropic efforts, recently donating $20 million to the Savannah Community Foundation. This generous donation is just one of many throughout his successful career. Mr. Speaker, the First District of Georgia appreciates Greg and his many years of friendship.

"Mr. Chair, what I can say is, in 2024, we had approved—"
"Mr. Speaker, exactly 100 years ago less a day, 468 Presbyterians, Methodists and Congregationalists in west Toronto put aside their differences to worship together for the first time. They gathered at a church at 432 Runnymede Road, a church they had just disassembled together and reassembled six blocks away. They were part of a national movement sweeping farming communities, small towns and cities across Canada. Scarred by war and motivated by their faith and their belief in justice, these believers put aside their differences to create The United Church of Canada. This weekend, I had the honour of joining members of Runnymede United Church, still at 432 Runnymede Road, for their 100th anniversary celebration. Thanks go to centennial committee chair David Ambrose and all of those who put on and attended this celebration. The community at Runnymede United is active, reconciling with its past and reaching beyond its community to its neighbours and the world beyond. It is a spirit we see throughout the riding of Taiaiako'n—Parkdale—High Park, and at a time when so many are doom-scrolling, retreating or dividing, it is one that I commend to this House."
"My hon. Friend raises an important question. We are committed to improving women's experience of gynaecological procedures, including hysteroscopies. Women should be provided with information prior to their procedure so that they can make an informed decision about the procedure and pain relief options, including local or general anaesthetic. He will probably make further representations, which we will certainly look at."
"Mr. Speaker, I regret that the member feels that he is being chirped. I was actually just participating in the comments that were being shared. Where I am coming from is that the legislation, at least in the riding of Waterloo, is not a monolith of voices. People are interested in the legislation. Today we heard speeches from colleagues from the Conservative Party, as well as from the Bloc, suggesting that the legislation did have some validity. Amendments could be considered, but there was value to the legislation; it just is not exactly in the way that some members would like to see it. I recognize that there is more work to do, but I would like to ask whether the member thinks there is merit to the legislation. If police associations are asking for it and we are providing it, is there merit to the legislation? Should we try to make it better?"
"Mr. Chair, when the projects are designated, they will be made public."
"Mr. Speaker, our government received a mandate from Canadians to negotiate a new security and economic partnership with the United States. We entirely share our colleague's view that the tariffs imposed, and they are not only on steel and aluminum, at a ridiculously punitive rate of 50%, are unjustified and illegal, as are all the other tariffs imposed on the Canadian economy. That is why Canada responded firmly and clearly. We also said that we will support our industries and our workers as we get through this together."
"Mr. Chair, that is a matter that should be dealt with by the parole board."
"Absolutely. [Laughter.] We are going to have no disagreement whatsoever because what we need is a Government who will deliver the jobs and skills that have already been identified. While the investment into STEP--spherical tokamak for energy production--fusion in north Nottinghamshire has the potential in time to unlock new skills, jobs and opportunities that will completely change the industrial landscape of my area for years to come, my demand of Government is an industrial strategy that encompasses and prioritises the left-behind areas."
"I can assure my hon. Friend that we are determined to see the main works civil engineering contracts completed as soon as possible. That is the element of construction that generally creates most disturbance for local communities, and we are pretty much at peak construction now. I thank her constituents for their patience while we continue to deliver this vital new piece of rail infrastructure."
"Before I recognize the member for Columbia—Kootenay—Southern Rockies, I would remind our members to be careful of their language during the debate. The hon. member."
"I would just remind members to address their comments through the Chair. Questions and comments, the hon. member for Pierre-Boucher—Les Patriotes—Verchères."
"I rise today to recognize Michelle Nuckols for being named the 2025 Cattlewoman of the Year by the Tulare County Cattlewomen's Association. Michelle moved to Visalia, California in 1975 with her parents at the age of six. She discovered her love for agriculture in high school through Mt. Whitney High School's FFA program, where she quickly immersed herself. Her involvement in FFA inspired her to pursue a career in agricultural education, leading her to attend the College of the Sequoias and later Fresno State University. While at Fresno State, Michelle met her husband, Justin Nuckols, who came from a farming family in Porterville. The two married in 1995 and made their home near Justin's family farm. Following graduation, Michelle began teaching at Tipton Elementary, where she has now served for over 29 years. In addition to teaching English, she offers an agriculture elective that introduces students to FFA and Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) projects. Her class includes hands-on lessons about dairy and beef cattle, visits to local farming operations, and a variety of experiences designed to connect students to agriculture. Michelle also has a deep passion for photography, which has inspired her to preserve the farming traditions of Justin's family farm through the lens of her camera. She captures branding events, assists in tagging calves, and most importantly, ensures that donuts and cold drinks are available for all who attend. Since Justin's unexpected passing in 2022, Michelle has taken on a more active role in the family's cattle operation alongside her sons, Tanner and Carson. She also joined Tulare County Cattlewomen, continuing her lifelong support for agricultural education and honoring Justin's legacy through advocacy and community involvement. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Michelle Nuckols on being awarded Tulare County's 2025 Cattlewoman of the Year."
"Madam Speaker, it is good to see you in the Speaker's chair. I am thankful for the opportunity to take part in today's debate. As hon. members are aware, one of the things the Prime Minister did upon assuming his responsibilities was to introduce regulations ceasing the application of the federal consumer fuel charge, effective April 1 of this year. As we also know, one of the first things our government did at the beginning of this parliamentary session was introduce Bill C-4 , which would take a further step by completely repealing the consumer carbon price from Canadian law. For the purpose of considering today's motion, it is important to bear in mind, however, that this is not the only thing that Bill C-4 would accomplish. Of particular relevance to today's motion is the fact that Bill C-4 would cut taxes for nearly all Canadians. In our government's Speech from the Throne, we outlined our bold and ambitious plan for the future, and key to this plan is bringing down costs so Canadians can keep more of their paycheques to spend on what matters most to them. To make that happen, we introduced Bill C-4, the making life more affordable for Canadians act, which is before Parliament for consideration. There are a couple of ways this bill would save money for all Canadians, including those in the province of Quebec. Upon receiving royal assent, the bill would first legislate the delivery of our government's middle-class tax cut, providing tax relief for nearly 22 million Canadians and saving two-income families up to an average of about $840 a year in the year 2026. More specifically, this would be accomplished by reducing the lowest marginal personal income tax rate from 15% to 14%, effective July 1, 2025. This would help hard-working Canadians all across Canada, in all provinces and territories, keep more of their paycheques to spend, as I said, on what matters most to them. It would mean more money for groceries, kids, housing-related costs and whatever matters most to those families. To start with, this middle-class tax cut is expected to provide $2.6 billion in tax relief to Canadians over the next six months and $5.4 billion in the year 2026, which would be the first full year when the tax rate is 14%. Then, going forward, the middle-class tax cut is expected to deliver over $27 billion in tax savings to Canadians over five years, starting in 2025-26. As we have made clear in the course of the debate on Bill C-4 , most of the benefits of this tax cut would go to the hard-working Canadians who need it most. A core principle for the government, as it always has been for the Liberal Party of Canada, is to help those who need it most first and prioritize them in all of our policy development and work—"
"Mr. Chair, vetting security risk is something—"
"I am pleased to join my hon. Friend in welcoming the strategic defence review, which was launched by the Prime Minister in Scotland on Monday and included more than PS400 million of investment in military accommodation in Scotland. I am sure that, like me, my hon. Friend will be appalled that the First Minister snubbed a confidential briefing on that strategic defence review to go campaigning, during a by-election campaign, at a charity whose funding he had slashed."
The hon. member.
"I welcome the pace and focus that the Home Secretary has brought to Baroness Casey's report. She is right to highlight the risk of the online space and the rapidity with which it has become a focus. Can she give assurances that protocols will change accordingly, so that we look for the information that we do not know about, and that the cases of survivors and victims who have been criminalised will be quashed, so that those people do not carry convictions for the exploitation that they experienced?"
"I would say to the hon. member, before she starts in that vein, never to direct a comment directly to the other member, but to speak through the Chair."
"Mr. Speaker, aluminum workers in our Saguenay region are very concerned. The Prime Minister promised Canadians that he would stand up to the Americans and their tariffs, yet President Trump is once again threatening to impose a 50% increase. Meanwhile, the Liberal government has reduced tariffs on American products to almost zero, but the Prime Minister assured us that the government would take in $20 billion. Can our workers in Saguenay find out how much the Prime Minister has gotten from countertariffs so far?"
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it sure does feel like Democrats are going back and forth on him, and there is lots of whiplash going on, so my colleagues on the other side of the aisle need to make it clear because now Democrats are quoting him on the floor. What is embarrassing really, truly, is that the Democrats adhere to their talking points and repeat them and repeat them, and this is a perfect example of where Democrats are spreading misinformation. The minority wants the public to believe that Republicans are cutting Medicaid, and we are not. We are making sure it goes to those people who need it and that we use every taxpayer dollar wisely. That means we are making sure that American tax dollars go to American citizens. That means strengthening the system so care can get to those who need it most and that we weed out waste, fraud, and abuse. Individuals who are suffering from substance addiction, like those we are working to help with the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act, are not subject to the work requirements in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Mr. Speaker, 11 Democrats voted for the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act coming out of committee. I think that we need to make sure that we are sticking to the facts instead of Democratic talking points. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Finstad)."
I call the shadow Secretary of State.
"I could not agree more. The record of stops and starts on home upgrades and home insulation is one reason that we failed to insulate as many households as we should have done from the energy price spike. We are committed to a long-term plan to upgrade millions of homes across the country. That is what the warm homes plan will do. We are delighted that this has been backed by the Chancellor with PS13.2 billion of investment, and we are now working on how we draw that out across the country. We will make sure that we have the right solution for every household, using a combination of insulation, solar, and heat pumps. We want every household that gets an upgrade to have a home that is warm and much, much cheaper to run. That is our absolute focus and priority. On the future homes standard, we have been working very closely with colleagues in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and consulting with developers. We are absolutely committed to driving forward standards. We have set out our ambition to make sure that future homes are fit for the future, using solar and clean heat solutions. We cannot have the situation that we have had in the past, where we built homes that needed retrofitting a few years later. We are committed to our ambition and we will be setting out more details in the warm homes plan."
"I declare Motion No. 9 carried. I therefore declare Motion No. 16 carried. The next question is on Motion No. 11. If a member participating in person wishes that the motion be carried or carried on division, or if a member of a recognized party participating in person wishes to request a recorded division, I would invite them to rise and indicate it to the Chair."
"The Minister mentions family members and other individuals raising complaints, but some of the complaints will be about devolved issues such as health, education and other issues that affect families. Can he reassure me that the Armed Force Commissioner will have an effective method of working with the devolved Administrations to make sure that the concerns of armed forces across the UK can be addressed?"
"Mr. Speaker, the motion we are dealing with today is very straightforward, recognizing that families in Canada are going to have to pay an extra $800 for groceries this year. This is a direct result of 10 years of the tired Liberal government's policies. The motion is simply calling for a fiscally responsible budget. The government has refused to bring forward a fiscally responsible budget. Is that because it has no budget to plan for or because it knows that it is not going to be fiscally responsible in that plan?"
The hon. member.
"Wales has a huge role to play in our clean energy mission and has excellent resources and a skilled workforce. We are supporting innovative renewable technologies, such as the tidal stream on Anglesey and floating offshore wind in the Celtic sea, which has the potential to deliver up to 5,000 new jobs."
"what is the hurry? What is the big hurry on this Big Beautiful Bill that President Trump wants to see the Congress pass? Well, the hurry is to make sure we don't stop and read it. It is 1,000 pages. And as we read it, we discover things included in that bill that passed the House of Representatives which may not be appealing to the people across America. The House of Representatives passed this bill by one vote. It ends up having a direct impact on many people across this country. Just imagine this, if you will. They are considering a bill, a tax bill, that will eliminate health insurance coverage for 16 million Americans. More people and families will lose health insurance coverage by virtue of this Big Beautiful Bill than any legislation we have passed in modern memory. In fact, just the opposite has been true. I have been here under the Affordable Care Act with President Obama when we expanded the reach of health insurance. Now, President Trump has us going in the opposite direction. Some Republican Senators, like Josh Hawley in my neighboring State of Missouri, have criticized this because he realizes how many people he represents count on Medicaid, the basic government program for health insurance. Senator Hawley says, even as a Republican, he can't support that provision. No one should support that provision. If you ever lived in a moment in your life with a sick child-- seriously sick child--and no health insurance, you will never forget it. I know. I have been there. To think that 16 million families would lose their health insurance is impossible to imagine. We received a report from the Congressional Budget Office just last week. They are neutral. They are not Democrats; they are not Republicans. They revealed that the Republican proposal would cost 16 million families their health insurance coverage, the biggest cut to healthcare in American history. No wonder then that Republicans want to move this bill quickly. They don't want to talk about the impact it is going to have on the Medicaid Program. Medicaid, of course, is a program that provides health insurance based on a person's income. Lower income individuals qualify for it; those in higher incomes don't. The facts are coming out now that many of the Republicans in the House are saying: Well, we didn't read the bill when it went through there. They havea chance to read it now. Republican and Democratic Senators have a chance to read it here. To make sure that the Senate Republicans don't make the same mistake as the House, here is a more detailed breakdown. With this analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, we have new estimates on how this bill impacts each and every State. Two hundred ten thousand people in my neighboring State of Missouri, Senator Hawley's State, could lose their health insurance coverage--210,000. In Iowa, nearly 100,000 people can lose their health plans. And our neighbor Indiana, 250,000 Hoosiers could lose the peace of mind that comes with having health insurance. It is the same story coast-to- coast: 40,000 people in Maine, 26,000 Alaskans, they are all going to be victimized. You say to yourself, What is it that is so compelling that the Republicans feel they can stand up and tell 16 million people in America you lose your health insurance? What will they use that money for? What will they take it to the bank for? For something very basic, tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America. Oh, there they go again, Democrats talking about tax cuts. Many of the Republicans deny that this is going to happen, but the facts are there. They estimate that the top 0.1 percent of wage earners in America under the Republican plan that passed the House will get an annual tax break of $400,000. Republicans quickly add: Go ahead and tell the rest of the story. Everybody gets a tax break. OK, let's go down to the other end of the spectrum: $400,000 for 0.1 percent wage earners. What about those making minimum wage? What will they get as a tax break? Twenty dollars a month. Twenty bucks a month while the cost of healthcare goes up and the cost of their margins go up--$20 a month. This, to me, is absolutely indefensible. Friday, I visited a hospital in Chicago. It is a special hospital. It is La Rabida, a children's hospital on the South Side of the town right on Lake Michigan. It is a wonderful hospital. Ninety percent of the families that bring their children to La Rabida Hospital qualify for Medicaid. These are families of limited means, and they turn to this highly professional hospital which has a reputation of caring for the poorest kids as well as the richest kids. They treat them all the same, and they treat them well. When I visited the hospital, they told me a story of one of their patients. Her name is Leyone. She was born prematurely, 26 weeks. When she was born, she was only the size of the palm of your hand. She was given just days to survive. She needed a ventilator, tracheotomy tube, central line, an IV-like device that brought medicine to her heart, and much, much more. Today, Leyone is 4 years old. It is a miracle. Thanks to the incredible care provided by La Rabida and the love of so many people, she is here. Leyone's family was covered by Medicaid, the most highly targeted program for cuts in this Big Beautiful Bill. Ninety percent of the patients that come through the doors of La Rabida Children's Hospital in Chicago are on Medicaid. What is going to happen to that hospital? I will tell you what the hospitals tell me. Many of them are barely getting by, barely--not just in the city of Chicago but my downstate areas as well. They came out to see me 3 weeks ago, 20 hospital administrators from downstate Illinois. On their own, they wanted to tell me the story that the bill that passed the House of Representatives--the big beautiful Trump bill, the tax bill we are talking about here--will be devastating to these hospitals. Some of them won't survive. What does it mean to a small- or medium-sized city that is lucky enough to have a good hospital and lose it? Well, the obvious: If you need emergency medical care, it is a longer drive. If that baby is about to be born, it is a longer drive. When it comes down to treatment, these hospitals provide the first in urgent care, and if that hospital closes, what happens? Well, it takes longer to get that care. In addition to that, it also means that a major part of the local economy is gone--gone. How are you going to attract a business or keep a business when you lose your hospital? That is what is at stake here because of the cuts in the Medicaid Program. So the Trump Big Beautiful Bill is designed to cut the program that these hospitals rely on most--the Medicaid Program. Now it turns out that because they add so much to the deficit-- trillions of dollars to the deficit--for this tax cut, you are also facing the possibility of something called sequestration. What that means is that there will be less coverage for Medicare. Medicare is a program created in the 1960s under President Lyndon Baines Johnson that provides for families who are elderly and need some help in paying medical bills. It worked miracles. People started living longer and being healthy and being able to survive. But now they want to cut back on Medicare as part of sequestration. This would be devastating to the many people who count on it. It is not just La Rabida that would face devastating consequences under these Medicaid cuts; red States and blue States will also suffer. When you cut $800 billion out of Medicaid, hospitals that are on the edge close. Already today, 26 rural hospitals in Kansas--26 hospitals in Kansas--and 9 in Missouri are at risk of immediate closure. This Big Beautiful Bill could push them over the brink. According to America's Essential Hospitals, uncompensated care costs for hospitals will increase by $42 billion in a single year under this Republican Big Beautiful Bill. For the rural hospitals that are hanging by a thread, this bill could permanently close their doors. Hospitals are not the only ones. The Medicaid Program provides for help in paying the bills of over half of the people who are in nursing homes. So if your parents or grandparents are in a skilled care facility or in a nursing home and you are happy with where they are and you want to keep them there, you have a new challenge. If the Big Beautiful Bill providing tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America passes, the compensation to that nursing home will go down. When that goes down, many of these nursing homes are going to close, and the choices for someone you love in your family will be limited. As if an increase in healthcare premiums isn't enough, the cost of basic goods will skyrocket under this Republican plan. The ``Big Beautiful Betrayal'' will raise energy bills up to $400 a year for families and 10 percent for businesses. Remember what I told you the tax break was for people who are on a basic income in this country--20 bucks a month? Well, it turns out $400 a year, which is dramatically more than 20 bucks a month, is going to make it even harder. It will increase costs by hundreds of dollars a year for 80 million households, all while giving $400,000 to Elon Musk and the wealthiest Americans. If housing weren't already too expensive, many Americans will see their mortgages increase by $600 a year. Want to follow your passion and start a business? Small business loans are estimated to increase under the Big Beautiful Bill by $1,000 a year. Tariffs are estimated to raise costs for American households by around $2,500. If this last election were about the cost of living and giving families a fighting chance to survive paycheck to paycheck, this bill is devastating for those who aren't the wealthiest in America. I urge everyone to learn the facts and know what effect this Republican tax bill will have on families across my State and others. This year, for the Fourth of July, the most American thing we can do is, on a bipartisan basis, stop this disaster. What does it take to say pause? stop? We don't want to cut Medicaid. We don't want to take health insurance away from 16 million people. We don't want to see the expenses of families going up. What does it take? It takes four--four-- Republican Senators who will step up and say: This is a mistake. Donald Trump is trying to rush us into something which is not good for American families. It is good for billionaires. If you happen to be in that category, this is a great day for you. But for ordinary families who are struggling with their regular bills they have to pay, the Big Beautiful Bill is a big, beautiful betrayal of American families."
"Mr. Chair, again, I would refer back to my comments, which my colleague should look into and read. All public servants and the companies must follow conflict of interest rules. There are robust rules in place in every department and they must follow those rules."
"Mr. Chair, I do not intend to purchase a firearm or use a firearm."
"My constituents Peter from Liverton Mines and Morgan from Brotton are very keen to buy electric vehicles, but they are unable to because they do not have driveways on which to charge them. Will the Government take it upon themselves to make it easier for people to buy electric vehicles, and find solutions to pavement charging?"
"The strategic defence review sets out that the UK will harness new technology through dynamic networks of crewed, uncrewed and autonomous systems. We will always comply with the relevant regulatory framework and international humanitarian law. I can tell my hon.  Friend that IHL compliance is absolutely essential as we look to use more artificial intelligence enabled weapons systems in the future."
"Oh, oh!"
F-35As--hard power; BBC World Service--soft power. Does the Prime Minister agree that the World Service is a crucial element of our soft convening power?
The hon. member for Calgary East has the floor.
"I have not spoken so far in these debates, but I have listened and attended on pretty much all occasions. I am moved to speak today because I am concerned. This is the point that the hon. Member for Lewisham North (Vicky Foxcroft) made, but what is this debate today about? This debate is not about the principle of what we believe in when it comes to assisted dying--whether we are opposed to it or in favour of it. We had that debate on Second Reading. As the Mother of the House, the right hon. Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), made very clear--in what I must say was an excellent speech--and as others  have too, today's Third Reading debate is about what we are about to pass on to the House of Lords, which will become law. And the single question we have to ask ourselves is: is this genuinely workable now? The hon. Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater), who moved the motion, knows that I have a high regard for her--I have worked with her on other things--but I honestly have to say that I simply cannot see how we in this House can pass this piece of legislation through to the other House, in the vague hope that somehow it will do better than us and make changes such that it will become a workable piece of legislation, and that is because this is a private Member's Bill. If a Government were to introduce a Bill like this, we would see a great deal more input and a huge amount more checking with all those bodies. For example, we were told on Second Reading that the safeguards and protections we were sending to Committee would somehow become the most robust and strongest in the world. In fact, in Committee they got weakened, not strengthened, and that is the problem in all this."
The Minister must be a mind reader. Will she give us a timescale for when the new medium-lift helicopter contract will be awarded? I hope it will be awarded to Leonardo in my constituency.
"I rise today to introduce a resolution to condemn the illegal and international use of flag of convenience practices in maritime efforts. I am honored to be working alongside Representative Tokuda and the Oceana in this effort, a leading maritime conservation NGO. Flags of convenience is a practice that allows a ship to register their ship under another country to avoid certain regulations, taxes, and fees associated with their country. Among other things, this is a growing threat to U.S. maritime security, labor standards, and economic interests. To quote Dr. Max Valentine of the Oceana organization:  Transparency at sea isn't just a tool for ocean conservation. It is essential for protecting workers, enforcing maritime security, and ensuring a level playing field for the global fishing industry."
I call the Opposition Front Bencher.
"I completely appreciate my hon. Friend's comments. I think everybody in this House shares them, and I feel that strongly and am committed to doing exactly that. We have recently received the analysis from the Government Actuary on the options for making a transfer to scheme members. Because we received that information, I had a meeting with the trustees today to hear their views on that analysis. At that meeting, I committed to move at speed. My officials are meeting the Treasury tomorrow. We are going to put a recommendation to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and I made a commitment to meet the trustees again before the summer break so we continue to make progress as fast as we can."
I ask unanimous consent to waive the mandatory quorum call with respect to the Fotouhi nomination.
"Mr. Speaker, the Liberals' catch-and-release policies are so bad that mayors and city councillors are pre-emptively writing letters to Crown counsel begging them to keep the bad guys in jail. Mayor Rathor of Williams Lake recently wrote, “We vehemently oppose Jacob Daniel FUNK’s release.... The actions of this individual have put our residents and property at significant risk.” He said that when Jacob Funk is in jail, the crime rate goes down; when he is out, the crime rate goes up. Why does the Prime Minister keep putting the rights of criminals ahead of those of Canadians?"
"Mr. Speaker, as I see it, one thing is perfectly easy to understand. My colleague said that Quebeckers did not participate in the federal carbon pricing system because Quebec has its own carbon exchange and so Quebeckers were not entitled to the rebate. While they may not have been entitled to the rebate, neither were other Canadians, since they did not pay the much-talked-about carbon tax for the period for which they received the cheque. It would be like telling a person who does not pay income tax to expect a tax refund. It does not work that way. It is as simple as that. The people who paid the full cost of the infamous carbon tax rebate were Quebeckers as a whole. The rebate was not paid out of money from the tax itself. Quebeckers and Canadians paid for it together, and Quebeckers contributed $800 million. Can the member grasp that, or is the concept too complex for her?"
The hon. member.
"I thank my hon. Friend for championing jobs and livelihoods in her constituency and the region, and for welcoming the historic PS1.8 billion of investment announced today for transport infrastructure. As she rightly alludes to, the announcement is about transport infrastructure, but the Government are doing much more to improve lives, wages and communities in every part of the country. We will be setting out further information in the coming weeks in relation to other types of infrastructure as well as how, through the industrial strategy, we are supporting skills, jobs and training opportunities for people so they can get better jobs and better pay. I note that, of course, the transport funding announced today will serve one of the largest advanced manufacturing zones in the United Kingdom, which will be great news for her constituents and great news for the country."
"Mr. Speaker, again, I would ask the Minister of Environment, how long has it been since the UN Convention on Biological Diversity came into effect? I think she should know that, as the Minister of Environment. It is very important."
"I oppose H.R. 1 and believe it reflects profoundly misplaced priorities for America. Accordingly, it is my intention to make the following motions to commit the bill:  A motion to commit the bill to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs with instructions to report back to the Senate with changes that include provisions terminating the mass termination of federal employees who are veterans without a report to Congress 60 days ahead of such action, detailing the positions, agencies, and number of federal employees dismissed. Mass termination is defined as more than 1% of any federal agency's workforce who are veterans as of January 20, 2025. A motion to commit the bill to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs with instructions to report back with provisions that provide $882,000,000 to the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant program within the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A motion to commit the bill to the Committee on Finance with instructions to report back with changes that would ensure that no State with a Medicaid expansion trigger law would see a reduction in its Federal Matching Assistance Percentage that would cause such a trigger law to take effect. A motion to commit the bill to the Committee on Finance with instructions to report back with provisions that would eliminate estate tax cuts for multi-millionaires and utilize the savings to reduce the number of Americans who would lose health care coverage under the bill. A motion to commit the bill to the Committee on Finance with instructions to report back with provisions that would not increase the deficit in years beyond the budget window when measured against a current-law baseline produced by the Congressional Budget Office in consultation with the Joint Committee on Taxation. A motion to commit the bill to the Committee on Finance with instructions to report back with provisions that would provide small businesses, farmers, and low- and moderate- income families with relief from the duties imposed pursuant to Executive Order 14257 (90 Fed. Reg. 15041; relating to regulating imports with a reciprocal tariff to rectify trade practices that contribute to large and persistent annual United States goods trade deficits)."
"In Scotland, over 10,000 children are stuck in temporary accommodation, including many in my constituency. Too many families face soaring rents, long waiting lists and dwindling options. It is just one of so many policy failings--we are all losing count and losing patience--as public confidence in the SNP's ability to govern collapses. What advice does the Deputy Prime Minister have for the SNP Government as they continue to preside over a chronic failure to invest in the social and affordable housing that Scotland desperately needs?"
"The latest data from the Environment Agency shows nearly 17,000 reports of waste crime across England in the past year, with the west midlands sadly showing the highest concentration of incidents. Waste crime costs the UK  economy around PS1 billion annually, and no doubt the Labour-led Birmingham bin strikes are not helping. Can we have a debate in Government time on the problem of waste crime and the need to take action to tackle both waste crime and the bin strikes, which have been going on for over 100 days?"
I reserve the balance of my time.
The hon. member.
"I rise to speak to a number of the amendments before us. I spent a lot of time with colleagues on the Public Bill Committee,  and some of the amendments are very good and some are not so good. I will try to rattle through as many as I can. I support new clause 43, which stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (David Simmonds). Our villages should have the same protection as our towns. Villages have a unique character across all our constituencies, and I am privileged to represent six of them--Brickendon, Hertford Heath, Great Amwell, Stanstead Abbotts, St Margarets and Goffs Oak. I have seen a local council that has built probably too much development in a village, and I have seen that change the fundamental character of Goffs Oak. We should be trying to protect that character, because when people move to villages, they do so for the rural way of life and their unique character and identity. We should stop urban sprawl, and we should stop villages linking together. I support new clause 39, because we should not be putting solar farms on all our agricultural land across the country. I do mind about that, even if it is only 1%, as the Minister and a number of Labour Members have made out--1% is 1% too much. Of course, I support solar panels, but why not put them on the roofs of new houses and factories? [Hon. Members: ""We are.""] They are not. I did not see the Government coming forward to support the sunshine Bill--the New Homes (Solar Generation) Bill--which was a private Member's Bill about putting solar panels on new houses, so we will not take any lectures from the Labour party on that. I fully support amendment 74, and I am surprised that the Government are not supporting it. They have made a number of announcements about ""brownfield first"", so why have they not put that in legislation? Why do they not accept this amendment and put that in the Bill if they are so determined to protect our green belt? I am hesitant about saying that, because I do not think they are determined to protect it. I do not think the Government care about the green belt in this country, because if they did, they would amend the Bill to safeguard the green belt and make development ""brownfield first"". I also support new clause 46, and I have spoken a number of times about development, particular in my constituency of Broxbourne. As several Members have said, developments come forward, particularly under outline planning permission, painted in gold. As I have said before, there is to be a new school, a new GP surgery, a new road, a park, lots of community facilities and lots of community money, but they are changed completely in the full planning application, because the developer has taken away all the infrastructure, and there is no new GP surgery, no new schools, no new infrastructure and no new community facilities. New clause 46 would go some way to making the infrastructure first, which is what our residents want. When planning permission is granted, it is easier for us as politicians to support it and to get our residents more in favour of it if the infrastructure is going to come first. If our constituents see hundreds of new homes built with no infrastructure, particular no new GP surgeries, that is when they get really fed up. I would also like to support new clause 63, which is about planting trees along highways. I think planting trees next to the highway makes a street beautiful and makes places where people want to live. This Government are focused only on building 1.5 million homes, which I do not think they will do. They are not focusing on designing, making the communities of the future and making communities liveable."
"a little more than a couple of hours ago, my friend and colleague Senator Alex Padilla attended a press conference in the Federal building in Los Angeles being held by the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem. Instead of treating him with respect, instead of answering his questions, he was grabbed by her security detail, he was physically forced from the room, forced to the ground, his arms pinned behind his back. This assault on a Member of the U.S. Senate is unlike anything I have ever seen, perhaps unlike anything anyone in this Chamber has ever seen, and it crystallizes the threat posed to our country and its democracy. If the administration can so mistreat a Member of this body, what can it do to every other American? What can it do to every other resident of the United States of America? What can it do to you? What can it do to your neighbor and to your community? The abusive treatment of Senator Alex Padilla, however, did not take place in isolation. It took place at a time of heightened tension in Los Angeles and around the Nation. Earlier this week, I returned from my home in Los Angeles, a city in which thousands have peacefully protested the administration's harsh immigration policies and in which the President has ordered the mobilization of thousands of National Guardsmen and hundreds of marines in order to deal with a few hundred vandals and miscreants that local law enforcement was more than capable of subduing. And the question is, Why? Why order in the military if they are not necessary? Why order in the military over the objection of local and State officials? Why go to the expense? Why go to the trouble? Why undertake such an obvious provocation? Why, in a city of over 500 square miles, did Donald Trump believe it was necessary to escalate so dramatically over the vile acts of a small number of people in the space of a few blocks? These are some of the questions I imagine that Alex Padilla wanted to ask the Secretary of Homeland Security. But now, today, we must add one more question: Why would they treat Senator Alex Padilla with such forceful and disgraceful disregard, forcing him to the ground? Why? And the answer involves failure and distraction and disrespect and disregard--failure of the President's immigration protocol, failure of his economic policy, a desire to distract from these failures, disrespect of our military and its role in civil society, and disregard of our democracy and the principles upon which our Nation was founded. Let's start with failure: the failure of Donald Trump's immigration policy; the failure, in particular, of his promise to deport massive numbers of violent criminals, a failure that was inevitable because it was based on a lie, a foundational lie--foundational to his campaign and to his Presidency--the original lie of the Trump campaign, the one he spoke as he descended the golden escalator in 2015 and suggested to the American people that most of the folks coming to this country as immigrants and migrants were murderers and rapists and violent criminals bent on doing harm to the American people, that foreign nations had opened their prisons and let out their worst offenders so that they could come to the United States and destroy our way of life. It was a big lie. It was an audacious lie but a lie that the President hoped he could ride, a wave of fear that he could in turn ride into office. The truth, of course, is the vast number of people coming to this country are peaceful, hard-working people who want nothing more than an opportunity to get ahead, to enjoy a good life, and to provide for themselves and for their family. The American people understood this, but they also understood that our border was broken, that our system was chaotic, that the immigration system was itself broken, that asylum cases took too long to adjudicate, and people waiting lawfully to immigrate should be given priority over those who do not. As President, Donald Trump promised his focus would be on the deportation of violent criminals, but he also promised mass deportations. And the only way to square that conflict between the very specific and the very broad was to go back to that original lie that all immigrants are violent criminals who mean us harm. If you can make the country believe that, you don't have to be targeted in your immigration raids, you don't have to go through the painstaking work of tracking down people with criminal records who don't want to be found. If you believe the lie that all immigrants are violent criminals, then you can do broad immigration sweeps at restaurants or on farms, in garment factories or high school graduations, in random neighborhoods and homes, or at the Home Depot. ``Just go out there and arrest illegal aliens,'' the President's Deputy Chief of Staff, a frustrated Stephen Miller, demanded after berating Department officials for the slow pace of their operations. Three thousand arrests a day the administration insisted on as a new quota, and gone was any pretense of looking for violent offenders. And so the indiscriminate raids and the indiscriminate cruelty began to multiply, picking up people who show up for immigration appointments or to take the oath of citizenship, only to deport them; separating fathers from their sons and daughters, mothers from their children, husbands from their wives; a farmworker who worked in the fields for decades--hard work, backbreaking work, work in the heat and the cold, work during a deadly pandemic when others stayed home, work that most U.S. citizens do not want to do and will not do--chased through the fields that they harvested to be taken away from their families; a mother chased down the street by hooded ICE agents, away from her terrified and screaming teenage daughter. Americans did not vote for this, do not want this. And in the midst of this, the American people started to speak out--at first, in small ways, in private conversations, after the deportation of their neighbors; and then in more public ways, at townhalls and in letters to the editor, on social media, and in gatherings at their schools; and then, as the raids increased in their scope and the scope of their cruelty, by taking to the streets, as is our God-given right and also a right given by our Constitution.  Some of those protests have taken place in Los Angeles, where Angelenos gathered to speak out against these actions, against the separation of families and the injury to our communities and our economy. And in the midst of these protests, some number of agitators were attracted by the conflict and saw it as an opportunity to vandalize, assault law enforcement, and engage in other reprehensible conduct. Like moths to a flame, every city has these miscreants, and so does Los Angeles. They care not about immigration policy or immigrants or migrants who are affected, and our State and local law enforcement are more than capable of dealing with them--and they did. But amidst the failure of his immigration policies and the backlash, Donald Trump saw an opportunity. His economic policy was in tatters. His tariff wars were not improving our trade with other nations and instead were prompting the boycott of American goods by close allies like Canada and causing layoffs at American ports, higher prices at Target and Walmart and elsewhere. He had to fend off Amazon plans to include a line item for the Trump tariff tax on each transaction, which would have made it even more obvious to the American people that he was betraying the central promise of his campaign: to bring prices down when they are going up. And his Big Beautiful Bill was in trouble over a big, ugly pricetag. Far from reducing the debt or the deficit, the bill was revealed to cost taxpayers a whopping $2.4 trillion added to the national debt. He was borrowing the money from our kids and our grandkids to fund a tax cut for himself and his rich friends. Even the world's richest man and, heretofore, the President's biggest benefactor, Elon Musk, called the bill a ``disgusting abomination'' and made it clear that Republicans should be ashamed of voting for it. And the opportunity Donald Trump saw in all this failure was this: Call in a distraction. Call in the troops. Call in the marines--not to save a city but to save himself from drowning in failure. And so he did: 4,000 troops from California's National Guard and 700 from the Marines. And the reaction in Los Angeles, of course, was the one that he desired: escalation, not deescalation; more conflict, not less; more chaos--and the kind of chaos he thrives on, the kind of chaos where the insurrectionist-come-President, the man who, on his first day, pardoned hundreds of criminals who beat police officers, could somehow try to reclaim the mantle of a law-and-order President. It has not worked. It will not work. Americans have a long memory and will not soon forget the images of January 6, when the President sat calmly in the White House dining room, dining on burgers and fries, while our Capitol Police were under assault. And the same man who called in the Guard to handle a comparatively small number of criminals and vandals in L.A. refused to call in the Guard to stop thousands of them from ransacking this Capitol. The last time a President called in the National Guard over the objection of the Governor of a State was in 1965, when the segregationist Governor of Arkansas ignored a ruling of the Supreme Court and refused to integrate the schools in that State. Lyndon Johnson did so to avoid violence and to protect the students trying to attend. Those circumstances could not be more different than today, when our President has called in the Guard knowing it is more likely to provoke violence than to stop it. ``We must reject any thinking of our cities as a `battlespace' that our uniformed military is called upon to `dominate,''' a Secretary of Defense once said. ``At home,'' he said, ``we should use our military only when requested to do so, on very rare occasions, by state governors.'' Those are the words of Donald Trump's Secretary of Defense--not Pete Hegseth, of course, not the FOX News version of a Defense Secretary, and not the Trump Defense Secretary before him or the one before that. No, those were the words of the first Trump Defense Secretary, James Mattis, perhaps the only Trump Cabinet member in his first term or the present term to leave his office with a stronger reputation than before he arrived. ``Militarizing our response,'' Mattis said, ``sets up a conflict . . . a false conflict--between the military and civilian society. It erodes the moral ground that ensures a trusted bond between men and women in uniform and the society they are sworn to protect, and of which they themselves are a part. ``Keeping public order,'' he said, ``rests with civilian state and local leaders who best understand their communities and are answerable to them.'' Now, in California, we love our National Guard. We revere them, as we do the Marines. The Guard is always there when we need them, during fires and floods, after devastating earthquakes. They serve us at home and abroad, always protecting our interests, our lives, our homes, and our freedom. There is a bond between us, a bond of respect, affection, and trust that must not be broken. Donald Trump does not understand this. He cannot understand it any more than he can understand why people choose a life of military service. The man who once called soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen who fight and have died on our Nation's behalf ``suckers and losers'' could not possibly understand. Nor does he care about misusing them if it suits his personal or political interest as his partisan, disrespectful and inflammatory speech at Fort Bragg makes clear, as does his commandeering of the military for a costly parade to celebrate his birthday this weekend. Now, there is a birthday worth celebrating this weekend, but it is not the President's. That is the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army, an Army that my father was very proud to serve in. We can and should honor the Army. But a celebration of the vanity of a President who does not himself celebrate the military but only his control over it, that is not a cause for celebration. Our Founders understood the need to insulate the military from internal domestic affairs, from the raucous and often divisive nature of the political process dominated by party or faction. For centuries, too, so has this Congress, prohibiting the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes, except for narrow--very narrow--circumstances of rebellion and insurrection. This is vital not only for the protection of the country from a man who would abuse the military to become a King but also to protect the military from the lack of trust that would accompany its subversion to a partisan end. Our country is approaching its 250th birthday. It is worth remembering why we chose to separate ourselves from our British masters. The preamble of the Declaration of Independence is familiar to us all in its poetic recitation of truths that are self-evident. But what has been lost to us over time were the long list of grievances set out in that document, grievances that drove the impetus for revolution: ``The history of the present King of Great Britain,'' it reads, ``is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations,'' this is what our Founders wrote, ``all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.'' The Declaration provides in its list of grievances: ``He has obstructed the Administration of Justice.'' ``He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people,'' they enumerated. ``He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone,'' our Founders charged. ``For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world,'' they objected. ``For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury,'' they declared. ``For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses,'' they cited in words all too prescient for today. ``He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, without the Consent of our legislatures.'' ``Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us.'' ``He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.''  All of these grievances so vivid at the time of the Revolution--our Revolution--are so vivid today. And today they can be distilled into a single image--that of Senator Alex Padilla on the ground, face to the ground, and in handcuffs. If you are looking for an image of our democracy in handcuffs, look no further. America, we have a choice. We can rededicate ourselves to the vision of our Founders, one born of struggle against autocracy, one pledged to a form of self-governance that elevated the people over the powerful, that believed we possessed sufficient virtue to be self-governing, that we did not need to be governed by a despot. We can rededicate ourselves to that vision or we can continue to travel down our present path of incivility, of division, of might not making right but making wrong, a celebration not of self-governance but of self-destruction. I believe in this country. I believe we are a great country because we always strive to be a good country. I believe in the country because of good people like Alex Padilla--wonderful people, beautiful people, courageous people, patriotic people. Alex Padilla's story is the story of all of us, the story of what is possible in this country. He is a good and decent man. He is a great and capable Senator. He deserved better than what he got in that Federal building in Los Angeles. The American people deserve better than what he got in the Federal building in Los Angeles. Let us remember ourselves. Let us remember who we are. We are the country of Jefferson and of Lincoln and of Washington. We are the country of John Lewis, and we are the country of giants. We stand on their shoulders. We owe our life, our liberty, the opportunity to pursue happiness to their brilliant legacy. We have come to the rescue and liberation of other worlds, of other parts of this globe. We have fought for democracy. We have championed democracy and human rights. We believed in treating others as we would treat ourselves. This is who we are. Alex Padilla face down in a Federal building, forced to the ground by agents of the Secretary of Homeland Security--this is not who we are. I can't help but think of the words of my late and wonderful colleague Elijah Cummings because they have always been such a potent reminder: We are better than this. We are better than this. We are not a country that sends the Marines into a city--not to restore order but to create disorder. We are a better country than that. We are not a country that needs to have a parade honoring our President to showcase our military might on his birthday. We are a better country than this. There have been giants who have served in our military. There have been giants that have served in this body, great people. They came from all different backgrounds. And the strength of this country--that is still so possible. You could come from any beginning and end up here. And we have been a country that has welcomed people from around the world because we have understood they bring their genius and their work ethic and their striving with them, and it has lifted our country forward. We have that beautiful Statue of Liberty not because we disdain immigrants, not because we view them as a threat, but because we celebrate what they have brought to this country. And I think in the last several years, we have forgotten who we are. Every now and then, we just need to step back from the abyss and remind ourselves of where we came from and that in this greatest Nation on Earth what is possible. I didn't serve with Alex Padilla in the State legislature, and I didn't get to serve with him or really get to know him well until I came to this body. And I told my colleagues when I got here: You all are wonderful people, but nobody--nobody--did better than I did in whom I got as my seatmate. I mean that with all my heart. He is a good and genuine and decent and capable and brilliant man. I will never forget that image I saw today because, to me, it is the image of what is best in this country being brought to the ground. I ask every Member of this body to think about the legacy we have been charged with protecting and what we are going to do from this day forward to make sure that this incredible experiment in self-governance continues and that we never see an act like we saw 2 hours ago take place again in the United States of America. I yield the floor."
"I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, this week, the House has the ability to advance four pieces of legislation under this rule. H.R. 3944 is the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2026, which provides significant investments and support for our veterans, servicemembers, and their families, as well as military construction. I expect and hope that it will pass in a bipartisan manner. H.R. 275 is the Special Interest Alien Reporting Act of 2025 which provides transparency by publishing a monthly report on the number of special interest aliens attempting to enter the U.S. and includes the encounter location and their country of origin. This is information that the public has a right to know. H.R. 875 is the Jeremy and Angel Seay and Sergeant Brandon Mendoza Protect Our Communities from DUIs Act of 2025, which works to keep the American people safe by closing a loophole in U.S. immigration law to ensure that aliens who drive intoxicated are inadmissible to, and deportable from, the United States. Again, Mr. Speaker, I hope and expect it will pass in a bipartisan manner. H. Res. 516 condemns the violent June 2025 riots in Los Angeles, California, which recognizes the right to assemble and protest peacefully while condemning the riots and violence against law enforcement. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on the previous question and ``yes'' on the rule. The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:  An Amendment to H. Res. 530 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts  At the end of the resolution, add the following: Sec. 9. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 2753) to amend the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to provide for a point of order against reconciliation measures that cut benefits for Medicaid or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and for other purposes. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Rules or their respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit. Sec. 10. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 2753."
"My wife was an obs and gynae doctor, and she still is. She was one of those people on the frontline whom the shadow Secretary of State describes. Does he agree that there needs to be a study into the long-term impact on the wellbeing of staff who were on the frontline dealing with these traumatic situations, so as to understand the impacts on health and productivity within the NHS?"
"This Government have been dragged kicking and screaming to deliver a national inquiry, having dismissed the pleas of the nation as  jumping on a far-right bandwagon. That reluctance is why my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth (Rupert Lowe) will continue his inquiry and why I will be supporting him it. Will the Government's inquiry investigate the political motivations behind the cover-ups, including the role of the Labour party, or will that continue to be swept under the carpet?"
"for months, I have been warning California's political leadership that our State is in violation of Federal civil rights laws, with a policy that even Governor Newsom has admitted is fundamentally unfair. That policy is one that allows for biological males to compete in women's sports. Today, that warning proved well-founded as the Department of Education concluded its investigation, finding that California is in blatant violation of Title IX. As a result, our State could lose its Federal education funding. The good news is that we don't have to. The State can prevent any loss of funding simply by complying with the Department's very reasonable conditions: reverse this unfair policy; provide titles, honors, and awards to female athletes who are unjustly deprived; and issue those athletes an apology.  This will simply restore fairness, common sense, and sanity in California. I am calling on California's political leaders to comply with these conditions immediately."
"Mr. Speaker, that was an historic meeting. Earlier today, some members of the House called it a love-in. When it feels like everyone is working toward the same goal of creating one economy out of 13, we know that we are going to create a lot of wealth in this country. We must build on collaboration between the regions, between the provinces, to ensure that we become more autonomous, more independent, more resilient. That is what ordinary folks want."
"I rise today in belated recognition of Post-Traumatic Growth Day--I repeat, post-traumatic growth. Observed annually on June 13 as part of National PTSD Awareness Month, this effort was initiated by Boulder Crest Foundation, a nationally recognized nonprofit helping veterans, first responders, and their families turn their struggles into strength. When we think about the numbers of veterans and first responders who have experienced an event, the numbers are small but not inconsequential and staggering but, I think, kept too well hidden. For example, over 50 percent of veterans have experienced at least one traumatic event in their lifetime. Mr. Speaker, let's just go back a little bit in history because ``PTSD'' was not always a term of reference and a term of the norm when it came to dealing with stress. In World War I, I believe the term was ``shell shock.'' In World War II, the term was ``battle fatigue.'' In Vietnam, when I was there, we used to call it the ``thousand-yard stare,'' a certain emptiness we would see in others that indicated an increased level of stress. That was then. How did we, especially in the military, deal with whether it would be battle fatigue, shell shock, or the thousand-yard stare? Back in World War I and World War II, there was this thing called the troopship. When, let's say, you were in the South Pacific and coming back to the States, you boarded a troopship somewhere and sailed, in some cases, for well over a month just to return to U.S. soil. It was the same thing with the European theater or the North African theater. There was a long period of time where those combat veterans who had been under tremendous stress had a chance to decompress over a period of time with each other and share their experiences, cry, hug, laugh, but work through it in a way that used the element of time together to, again, work through the challenges of the horrific events that they had experienced.  {time}  2020  In Vietnam, the timeline shortened a little bit, and please don't let me forget Korea, as well. Because when you look at the memorials here in Washington, D.C., you have got the World War II Memorial, which is a tremendous testament to our country coming together to overcome evil. You have got the Korean War Memorial. For those of you who have been there, the darkness of that memorial is evident in the expressions on the faces of those soldiers there at the Korean War Memorial. You have got the Vietnam Memorial, which has all the 58,000-plus names of the men and women who gave their lives in Vietnam. Some of my colleagues who served there, the only way that they can come to grips with some of their PTSD is to go to the memorial and visit their comrades whose names are on the wall. We have dealt with it differently, but we tended to think of it as relieving stress in a negative way. After 9/11, after Desert Shield, and Desert Storm, the first war that we were involved in where members could be on the battlefield one day and back literally in their homes within 48 hours. During OIF and OEF where a person could come off the battlefield on a Wednesday and, again, be at home watching TV and watching their friends on the battlefield within 48 hours, there was no time to decompress. There was no time to work through the challenges that you have seen. What do we do? Well, PTSD is real. Nobody disagrees with that at all. How do we turn a negative into a positive? Well, how about in changing the term ``post-traumatic stress disorder'' into ``post-traumatic growth.'' Take the experience, work through it in such a way that you grow from it. Think about all the men and women who currently serve, only about 10 percent have been diagnosed with PTSD. That is of all who served. For those who served in combat zones, the rate of PTSD can reach up to 20 percent. Among first responders, police officers, firefighters, and EMTs, 80 percent have experienced at least one traumatic event while on the job. Between 10 and 30 percent of first responders will develop post- traumatic stress disorder. Again, whether you are in the military, whether you are a first responder, whether you are a NICU nurse, a cardiac nurse, a physician, you give it all for those people you are serving. Whether you are a first responder in the healthcare field, or in the military, how do you deal with it? How do you deal with what you gave? Can you return to a positive attitude in your life? That is why the belief among servicemembers and first responders who have gone through this, we have figured out that the best way to deal with what we deal with internally is to move forward with an attitude of what happened happened. How do we grow from it? It is easier said than done because in the society in which we live today with instant communications, social media, and reliving things, it is tough, in many cases, to leave the negative behind us. There are different therapies, group therapy, individual therapy, there could be potentially in some cases, as we advance therapies in new areas, and not taking a pill--here, take a pill for this. This will make you feel better. If that pill doesn't make you feel better, take two of these pills type of thing. We have to get rid of that because it doesn't help. We are human beings, and I would suggest to you that one of the options we have to promote the idea of post-traumatic stress is to get behind some good things. Both Democrats and Republicans here in Congress, who want to do better in this arena, there is a caucus here in the House of Representatives called the PATH Caucus. It was formed about 3 years ago. I happen to be the Republican lead and my dear friend and colleague Lou Correa from Los Angeles is the Democrat lead. We call it the Noah's Ark Caucus, where one Democrat and one Republican come together and join it, but the whole goal as the PATH Caucus--the title is, Psychedelics Advancing Therapies, keyword advancing therapies. We have kind of casually renamed it the good path caucus, which means get off opioid dependency and advance new therapies to allow members of the military and first responders and everybody else to actually get inside of themselves and be able to release those demons through different kinds of therapies that don't involve taking a pill, taking another pill, taking another pill, changing the pills, whatever it happens to be, forever. It is about new therapies that will enable those members going through it to open up their minds, clear out the demons, and move forward with life. We have a responsibility as the House of Representatives and as the legislative branch of our government, to include the Senate, to do the best we can on the legislative side in enabling resources to be focused on research that enables that individual growth to occur. We are a long way from getting to the point where we can say we are done with this. We will never be done with it. There will always be new advancements in therapy, new advancements in dealing with the human mind, the brain, the least explored and least understood part of the human body, but it is who we are as God's creatures that will enable us to move forward with continuing to grow. I am honored tonight to just call this to the attention of the people watching and especially to my colleagues who--again, not Democrat or Republican--have chosen to make the world a better place by helping people be their best selves, to continue to grow after, in some cases, very horrific, stressful events. I ask everyone who is listening, please consider--because we can all have a bad day--what a positive affect you can have on others when you present yourself to them, when they are under a time of extreme stress and potential disorientation, to lead them down a path that they can grow from what they have gone through. We can all make this world a better place by helping one another.  I thank the Speaker and the House for allowing me to talk today on celebration of post-traumatic growth normally. We will be celebrating it again next year on the 13th of June on that annual day. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."
"As far as I am aware, EHC plans will continue. We know that children's earliest years make the biggest difference to their life chances. As I have already said, we believe in early intervention and recognise the importance of high-quality early years education and care, which can lead to better outcomes for children. Having access to a formal childcare setting allows children's needs to be identified at the earliest opportunity, so that the appropriate support and intervention can be put in place to allow children with SEND to thrive. Arrangements are in place to support children with SEND to access Government funding in early education, including funding for disability access and special educational needs inclusion and the high needs NFF allocations to support local authorities. We are reviewing early years SEND funding arrangements to assess how suitable the current arrangements are for supporting the needs of children with SEND. The additional funding for schools of more than PS4 billion a year over the next three years announced in the spending review will provide an above real-terms per-pupil increase in the core schools budget, taking per-pupil funding to its highest ever level and enabling us to transform the SEND system. We will improve support for children, stop parents having to fight for support and protect the support that is currently in place. Details of the Government's intended approach to SEND reform will be set out in the schools White Paper in the autumn. The Government will also set out further details on supporting local authorities as we transition to a reformed system as part of the upcoming local authority funding reform consultation."
"Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting that the member is the one who was questioning the data that is coming from Statistics Canada and Farm Credit Canada, the Liberals' own Crown corporation and their own agency. The statistics are coming from their own government. If they do not believe those statistics, maybe they should make some changes within their own bureaucracy. It is interesting that he is the one who talks about misinformation."
"Mr. Speaker, the member needs to check the facts. The housing starts across Canada are up to almost 280,000 pace this year, which is almost at a record level. We have been building at a strong pace this year and last. We are seeing unprecedented levels of rental housing being constructed for the first time in decades. The government is delivering, and we will take it further. We will double the rate."
"Mr. Chair, when we talk about wildfires in this House, we are not talking about distant headlines in some far off place, we are not speaking in hypotheticals and we are not debating future possibilities. We are talking about the lived, tangible experiences tragically experienced by Canadians across this great country over the last several years. Canadians have woken up to orange skies and smoky air thousands of kilometres from the nearest fire. Canadians have had to flee their homes, neighbourhoods and communities. Canadians have risked their lives as first responders to extinguish flames. We are talking about children in my home province of Alberta who cannot play outside because the air is orange, including my own. We are talking about entire towns in northern Ontario, Saskatchewan and Manitoba that have had to evacuate with just minutes to spare, homes left behind, schools closed, family pets crated in back seats and highways jammed with uncertainty. We are talking about flames sweeping across forests and grasslands from Jasper to Gaspé, consuming not just trees and brush but also memories, livelihoods and entire communities. Just two years ago, wildfires shattered every known Canadian record. Fifteen million hectares of land burned, an area larger than England and roughly the size of Tunisia. Over 230,000 Canadians were forced from their homes. Nearly 11,000 domestic and international firefighters were deployed, and eight Canadian firefighters tragically lost their lives. Annual national costs for fighting those fires totalled over $1 billion, which represents a 60% increase to the annual average from 1980 to 2009. Just last year, in my home province of Alberta, the Jasper wildfire burned approximately 32,700 hectares, making it the largest blaze in the park in over a century. It devastated about one-third of the town's structures, tragically killed one firefighter and forced a mass evacuation of 25,000 residents. Now, in 2025, earlier than expected and in regions we once thought immune, it is beginning again. Canada is facing two interconnected crises, twin challenges that strike at the heart of our communities and identity. The first is the climate crisis. A warming planet is no longer just a projection and a report; it is our lived reality. Our fire seasons now start sooner and end later. They burn hotter, move faster and stretch deeper into once-untouched regions. What were once once-in-a-century fires are now annual events. What was once predictable is now erratic. The second is a crisis of sovereignty, where global volatility, unjustified trade actions and fragile supply chains test our ability to remain self-reliant and strong. When wildfires shut down transportation corridors, we all feel it. When pulp and paper mills close because forests are scorched or inaccessible, towns lose both jobs and community. When foreign tariffs hit our resource exports, it weakens not just industry but our national independence. We cannot afford to treat these as separate problems. We must face both, together and head-on. That is why the 2025-26 main estimates are not just an administrative exercise. They are not just columns on a spreadsheet. They are a blueprint for resilience, a statement of values and a declaration of action. They represent the government's resolve to protect Canadians, not just from the fires of today but from the risks of tomorrow. Through these estimates, we are investing where it counts: in people, in preparedness and in prevention. We are supporting the brave firefighters who suit up when everyone else is running the other way by funding modern gear and expanding training. We are empowering indigenous fire stewardship, recognizing that traditional knowledge and land-based practices are not just cultural heritage but critical science. We are investing in data, early warning systems, predictive modelling and real-time mapping, because when seconds count, so does every bite of information. We are also supporting communities before fire ever strikes, with education, FireSmart retrofits and land-management strategies to stop sparks from becoming infernos. These are not abstract commitments. They are line items in this year's estimates: $52.53 million for the wildfire resilient futures initiative, funding proactive strategies to manage risk and build national preparedness; $81.65 million for fighting and managing wildfires in a changing climate, training frontline firefighters in partnerships with provinces and indigenous governments; $1 million for the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, coordinating vital information and equipment sharing between jurisdictions; $2 million for wildland fire resilience, focusing on building community and landscape resilience to wildfires with prevention, mitigation and preparedness efforts; and $10.5 million for the spruce budworm early intervention strategy, addressing pest outbreaks, more likely because of climate change, that turn forests into tinderboxes, particularly in Quebec and the Atlantic. Together, these investments total over $147 million, but their value cannot be measured by dollars alone. They are a recognition that resilience must be built before disaster strikes and that the price of inaction is far greater than the cost of preparation. I want to speak for a moment not just about programs and policy, but about people: about the firefighter in British Columbia who worked 28 straight days sleeping in a tent and eating from ration packs to keep the fire line from breaching a town; about the indigenous elder in northern Quebec who taught community members how controlled burns used to protect their land and how they can again; about the Red Cross volunteers who set up cots, sorted blankets and offered hugs to evacuees; and about the business owner in Manitoba who, without being asked, kept their café open to feed weary fire crews and displaced neighbours. This is who Canadians are, and if they show up time and again, then so can we, as a government, as parliamentarians and as a country. Let us also be honest about the stakes. In 2024, insured losses from extreme weather events in Canada reached an all-time high of $8.5 billion. That is not just infrastructure. That is homes, memories and generational wealth. Natural Resources Canada projects that if we do not adapt, wildfire suppression costs could double by 2040, surpassing $2 billion annually. While we face fires at home, our global competitiveness is being tested. Canada's forestry sector, a cornerstone of many rural and indigenous economies, continues to be targeted by unjustified American tariffs. We are not only fighting fires; we are fighting for our place in the world, for our workers, for our industry and for our sovereignty. That is why these estimates also support Canada's long-term strength. We are creating new careers in emergency response, fire science, forestry and clean energy. We are coordinating across provincial and territorial borders so that when one jurisdiction needs help, others can answer. We are centring reconciliation, funding indigenous-led stewardship and governance that reflect deep-rooted wisdom and shared leadership. We are also investing in infrastructure to rebuild with resilience and modernize how goods, people and ideas move across this country. This is what 21st-century sovereignty looks like: not just military strength or economic might, but the ability to protect land, people and our future. I do not rise today just as a parliamentary secretary. I rise as someone who represents communities that have seen the sky turn grey at noon. I rise as an Albertan whose province knows intimately the ties between the forests and our future. I rise as a Canadian who believes deeply in this country's ability to lead, not in spite of our challenges, but because of them. I will close with this. We cannot change the winds, but we can adjust our sails, and that is what this government is doing. We are steering toward a more resilient Canada, a safer Canada and a stronger Canada. Let us move forward not as individuals or parties, but as one country united in purpose and ready to meet these twin crises with clarity, compassion and courage. I urge all members to vote in favour of the 2025-26 main estimates so we can fight wildfires, fight climate change and protect the sovereignty of this great nation we all serve. I would like to ask the minister about wildfires. This season's wildfires have already been devastating, and it is only June. This is the third year in a row that the severity and intensity of wildfires are clear. There is no doubt the frequency and intensity of these fires are a result of climate change. We need to urgently fight climate change to protect the Canadian way of life, but we must also protect ourselves from the impacts that are already being felt. Will the minister tell this House about what is included in the main estimates that would help Canada fight wildfires? What will the minister do moving forward to protect Canadians?"
"Madam Speaker, I congratulate my colleague on her election and on her fine speech. She clearly explained how our government is working to reduce the cost of consumer goods for Canadians. I would like my colleague to explain to me what our government is doing right now to reduce the cost of living for Canadians. As the member opposite said earlier, there is also some good news. The government is going to continue its efforts to help reduce the cost of living for Canadians."
"Mr. Chair, again, there are biometrics, even in the estimates. We have funding allocated for those, which is $55.5 million in the estimates. There are—"
"Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Hamilton West—Ancaster—Dundas . Since this is my first speech in the House, I would first like to acknowledge the voters of La Prairie—Atateken and thank them for putting their trust in me. I very humbly accept the role they have given me. I am committed to representing them to the best of my ability and to reporting on their concerns as accurately as I can here in the House of Commons. Although La Prairie—Atateken is a great place to live, there are still many challenges to ensuring that our communities develop harmoniously. I would like to take a few seconds to extend my warmest thanks to everyone who volunteered for my election campaign. Many of these friends and volunteers gave countless hours for the Liberal cause. I owe my victory to them, because it literally took the efforts of an entire team to have any hope of winning. Of all those volunteers, I will just single out one today. My son, Paul Ramsay-Vejlens, worked by my side for the 35 days of the campaign. It is a joy to raise our children, but it is no less a joy to be supported by them in turn. La Prairie—Atateken is within unyielded first nation land. I recognize that the Kanien’kehà:ka nation is the steward of the lands and waters in our riding. First to settle this land, the Mohawks have made Kahnawake a vibrant place with a rich cultural legacy. Kahnawake is a proud community where the words resilience, perenniality and self-determination resonate loudly. In addition to Kahnawake, La Prairie—Atateken is a large riding comprising seven cities: Sainte-Catherine, Saint-Constant, Delson, Candiac, La Prairie, Saint-Philippe and Saint-Mathieu. Together, we embrace the principle of meaningful reconciliation with our indigenous neighbours that is rooted in a social and economic reality. The history of our riding is bound up with major projects that brought people together and shaped our sense of community. In the 19th century, the construction of the Lachine Canal, the use of steamboats between Montreal and its south shore, and the opening of the very first railway in Canada, which linked La Prairie and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, turned La Prairie into a prime hub for trade between Montreal and New England. Proximity strengthened those ties over the years. In 1860, the opening of the Victoria Bridge further to the east relocated the transit point to Longueuil and slowed my region's economic development, but the construction of the Honoré Mercier Bridge on Kahnawake territory in 1934 and of the Champlain Bridge in 1962 stimulated the local economy, bringing in a growing wave of new residents who could now get to work in Montreal quickly. In fact, the riding's population has increased fivefold since 1960, which is not without consequences today, as we will see later. This population explosion has nevertheless taken place while preserving a significant amount of agricultural land, giving our territory a mix of both urban and rural character, as a place where residents can always count on a nearby supply of farm products. I am providing this historical background to show how, throughout its history, La Prairie—Atateken experienced spectacular growth whenever the authorities believed in its vitality and invested in its infrastructure. Today, when co-operation with the United States is under threat, what comes to mind is another, even older piece of infrastructure. In the 16th century, when the Jesuits were granted the seigneury of La Prairie and came to settle in the region, farmers quickly joined them. They did so because there was a mill where they could grind their grain, but above all because, very early on, a high palisade made of ash, cedar and pine stakes was erected to protect them from enemies, in this case an army of mercenaries from New England. With the introduction of the recent tariffs, our country is once again facing an attack from our American neighbours, this time in the form of an economic war. Once again, the people of La Prairie—Atateken, along with the rest of the country, will stand strong and protect our sovereignty. We will protect our economic interests. We will protect our agriculture, our language, our culture, our schools and our health care system. Above all, we will protect our institutions, the rule of law and our democratic values, which are at the heart of our identity. The time has come once again to take decisive action. At a time when U.S. tariffs are posing a serious threat to our economy, we must act on several fronts, of course. In particular, I would like to mention the major project to build 500,000 homes a year, including several thousand in my riding, which will be launched quickly to help our economy recover. On the campaign trail, I heard time and again how hard it is to find housing, much less affordable housing. The housing shortage is driving up prices, and our young people are struggling to buy their first home. The government recognizes this problem and wants to take action. We need housing to house Canadians. The affordability bill will exempt first-time homebuyers from paying GST on new homes, saving them up to $50,000. This measure will definitely help get new affordable housing built using local materials such as lumber, aluminum and steel. Housing construction meets an urgent need while providing a major economic stimulus, both for the construction and modular home industry and for primary industries such as the lumber, aluminum and steel industries. This is a strategic move that will help create good, well-paying jobs while addressing the housing shortage and stabilizing prices. It will kill two birds with one stone. Incidentally, expanding the housing stock will also help get seasonal labour programs back on track. Without them, many economic sectors, including agricultural businesses in La Prairie, would struggle to function. Our government is serious about the economic health of Canadians who are already struggling. Even though the government has succeeded in bringing inflation below 2%, it is being proactive and showing leadership without waiting for the effects of tariffs to be felt. To do that, the government is lowering taxes for 22 million Canadians by up to $800 per household. That is on top of other measures that are already in place. For example, over the next five years, until 2031, $9.8 billion will be paid to Quebec to fund the child care program, which will enable many families to earn additional income. Needless to say, child care is crucial for single-parent families and, until recently, it has contributed to the financial empowerment of many women. There are also the 4.8 million Canadians aged 18 to 64, who recently joined the ranks of those who may be eligible for free dental care. Again, those are substantial savings. Since 2016, our government has been funding the Canada child benefit, the same benefit that was criticized by our Conservative colleagues. Depending on family income, that can mean up to $7,437 per year for each child under the age of six and up to $6,275 per year for each child between the ages of six and 17. The Liberal Party is reducing child poverty. The strategy of this government has two prongs. On one hand, this government will foster investment and preserve jobs in spite of the unpredictable climate blowing from the south. To invest in infrastructure is a strategy that will benefit Canadian workers and families. The electors of La Prairie—Atateken have no problem understanding this because this is how their economy was built. On the other hand, this government is making sure nobody is left behind by protecting the buying power of Canadians. Although we are facing many challenges, the intelligence, skills and enthusiasm of the people in La Prairie—Atateken give me a lot of hope for the future."
"Mr. Chair, that is absolutely not my intention."
"I would like to send my condolences to the family, friends and loved ones of all those who lost their lives eight years ago. Does my hon. Friend agree with me that, if justice is to be delivered, the Government need to think very carefully about delivering on the Hillsborough law and the duty of candour?"
"Mr. Speaker, wow, that was a mouthful coming from the member opposite. Talk about misinformation or just completely misguided. If he wants to talk about housing, let us talk about the six houses that Pierre Poilievre built when he was the minister of housing. We still do not know where they are located. That is not to mention the suggestion that there are no skills involved in developing modular homes. Let us get to the bill itself. We had a very clear mandate on April the 28 to build one Canadian economy, and it is as straightforward as that. This bill would make a difference. It is part of the discussions that have taken place with all the first ministers in anticipation of our tabling the bill. Will the member get on side with reality and what Canadians told parliamentarians?"
"Madam Chair, I appreciate the minister's answer. As I said earlier, I have had the opportunity to work with him on different files, including the Canada-Africa file. I know that the minister has extensive experience as a parliamentarian as the parliamentary secretary for trade in the past. I just want him to talk about what is the importance of the role of engaging all parliamentarians in advancing trade and how they can also bring that back home to their communities and engage with stakeholders in that way."
"Mr. Speaker, as world leaders gather at the G7 summit, we must speak with one voice about international human rights and freedom of expression. The G7 is happening at a critical juncture. The trial of Jimmy Lai, Hong Kong political prisoner and defender of freedom of expression, is set to resume in mid-August. He is 77 years old, diabetic and has already spent four and a half years in arbitrary and illegal detention that UN experts have condemned. Jimmy Lai's case is probably one of the most publicized in the world. In 2023, both the House of Commons and the Senate unanimously approved motions calling for Mr. Lai's immediate release. Parliamentarians from all parties believe that granting him honorary Canadian citizenship will put pressure on the Hong Kong government to release him. I am one of them, and I sincerely hope that the members of this Parliament will join me in this call."
"I will give the hon. member an opportunity to discuss matters that relate directly to the opposition motion. That said, as members know, they have a lot of latitude in raising topics during a debate. The hon. parliamentary secretary wishes to comment on the same point of order."
"Happy birthday, Mr Speaker. In my Chatham and Aylesford constituency, Clarion Housing is working with Octopus Energy in Snodland to install roof solar panels and heat pumps in social housing units. Can the Minister confirm how we can expand on such schemes, using the tenant power tariff for example, to reduce energy costs for our most vulnerable constituents?"
"Madam Speaker, it is with the greatest sense of honour and pride that I stand today in this chamber giving my maiden speech, where countless Canadians before me have given of themselves to help shape the landscape of this great country we all call home, which is the envy of people around the world. I congratulate all my colleagues on their election or re-election. It is truly an honour to serve alongside each of them. I am the first MP in this riding elected for this party in a general election in more than 70 years. I would like to begin by acknowledging that my riding of South Surrey—White Rock is situated on the traditional, unceded territories of several Coast Salish nations, including the Semiahmoo, Kwantlen and Katzie First Nations. I am truly fortunate to stand here, not through my efforts alone but because of the hard work, dedication and belief of many. Volunteers, friends, family and strangers who became friends, people of all backgrounds, colours, faiths, languages, abilities, sexual identities and socio-economic statuses, believed in the values and vision that this party represents. These are the friends and neighbours of South Surrey—White Rock whose voices I am privileged to represent in this House. To my husband, my children and grandchildren, and my family and friends who encouraged me at every step of what was an intense and deeply rewarding campaign, I offer my deepest thanks. This seat also belongs to the many who came to this country as immigrants seeking a better life. I never imagined I would have the opportunity to publicly, in front of all Canadians, thank my parents for the profound gift they gave their children, the privilege of becoming Canadians. My grandfather was arrested and executed for teaching his children about a god, an act considered treasonous under a regime that denied faith. My grandmother was left with eight children. As a child, I often heard how my parents survived by eating field mice and taking whatever was left in the fields after they had harvested the produce they had to give to the Communist Party. Fortunately, after the Second World War, my father, through the Red Cross, reconnected with an aunt in Canada who sponsored my parents to come to Canada. Due to a freeze of immigration policy in Canada, my grandmother, together with several unmarried children, left Ukraine for Paraguay, but ultimately also came to Canada through the efforts of my parents. Although my parents had seven children of their own, they always strove to help their family who ended up in various countries after the Second World War, from Siberia to East Germany and Paraguay. I thank all those who struggled so their children and future generations could prosper in freedom. To the indigenous and aboriginal peoples, the original stewards of this land, I offer my thanks, my respect and my gratitude. From them, we continue to learn the sacredness of the land we are honoured to live on. It was a privilege indeed to be present in Ottawa during the historic royal visit of King Charles III and Queen Camilla and to witness the King deliver the Speech from the Throne in the Senate chamber. I heard a strong message of hope and renewal, a call to restore the values and dreams that define Canada. The 45th Parliament has a responsibility to identify and build on the strengths that have earned Canada admiration around the world, while also acknowledging the failures and injustices of the past and correcting our course when needed. While our country faces challenges, our core Canadian values that define us, democracy, freedom, the rule of law and the right to self-determination, are laid out clearly throughout the throne speech. These core values guide us nationally but also align with my personal priorities for South Surrey—White Rock. Already, our Prime Minister is renegotiating Canada's relationship with the United States, our neighbour and one of our many economic partners of the future. This relationship is vital to my riding, which is home to two of Canada's 32 land border crossings, the Peace Arch and the Pacific Highway border crossings. These crossings are more than that; they support trade, tourism and jobs. The land border duty-free shops contribute over $400 million annually to our economy and provide local employment. The tariffs imposed by the United States, which have put pressure on businesses, including more than 500 small businesses in my riding, are unjustified. As a small business owner for over 30 years, I understand first-hand the challenges and pressures on a business to remain open and thrive. Pivoting one's business has become the new way of modern business. I support our government's core mission to build the strongest economy by removing internal trade barriers and working closely with all the provinces and territories. At the doorsteps, I heard loudly and clearly that Canadians want the government to stabilize and focus on strengthening the economy for all Canadians, regardless of their political affiliations. Since occupying this chair, I see the opposition members criticizing but not bringing forward solutions. I hear them accusing us of copying and plagiarizing their platform. If indeed this is the case, is that not the greatest form of—"
"I congratulate my hon. Friend on the work that he and others have been involved in in Hartlepool. Driving up the take-up of all benefits so that people get the support to which they are entitled is important for ensuring that more poor households are able to eat, to heat their homes and to live a decent life."
"Let me say, in the spirit of openness, that as a young man I perhaps did not always drive as responsibly as I do now. Although the hon. Lady is making an important point, there is an educational component to this. Will she join me in commending the work of the Under 17 Car Club and its Pathfinder initiative, which teaches young drivers about the dangers of driving in that fashion?"
We now come to the urgent question. I call the shadow Leader of the House.
"now, on Senator Padilla, what happened last week to Senator Padilla was beyond the pale. I don't care who you are or what your views are, there is never justification for Federal agents to put their hands on a Member of the U.S. Senate, throw him onto the ground, and cuff him for no reason other than he was doing his job. The way agents treated Senator Padilla is what you see in totalitarian regimes. It is outrageous that Secretary Noem let this happen and then lied about the incident after the fact. Neither the Senate, nor any member of government, can tolerate a Member of this Chamber being treated in this way. Secretary Noem has proven herself to be derelict in her responsibilities. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."
"Mr. Chair, does the government condone and encourage fraud with outside consultants?"
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a point of order regarding the government's Bill C-5 , an act to enact the free trade and labour mobility in Canada act and the building Canada act. Standing Order 69.1(1) states: In the case where a government bill seeks to repeal, amend or enact more than one act, and where there is not a common element connecting the various provisions or where unrelated matters are linked, the Speaker shall have the power to divide the questions, for the purposes of voting, on the motion for second reading and reference to a committee and the motion for third reading and passage of the bill. The Speaker shall have the power to combine clauses of the bill thematically and to put the aforementioned questions on each of these groups of clauses separately, provided that there will be a single debate at each stage. In the case of Bill C-5 , the bill would enact two separate laws. Part 1 would establish the free trade and labour mobility in Canada act and part 2 would create the building Canada act. As stated in Bill C-5 , part 1, “establishes a statutory framework to remove federal barriers to the interprovincial trade of goods and services and to improve labour mobility within Canada.” I want to pause here for a minute. A member just crossed in front of me twice as I was speaking, which is against the rules of the House. Mr. Speaker, I take it that you will note that for later on. I will continue on with my point of order. Part 1 states, “It also provides the Governor in Council with the power to make regulations respecting federal barriers to the interprovincial movement of goods and provision of services and to the movement of labour within Canada.” The purpose of part 1 is to remove domestic trade barriers. In other words, it is an act to promote free trade and labour mobility within Canada. This was reinforced in the Minister of Transport 's speech in reference to part 1 of the bill, when she succinctly said, “This is why it is so essential for us to press ahead with a project that costs nothing and can be accomplished at the stroke of a pen, delivering...free trade in Canada.” She also stated, “Free trade in our own country is a great idea whose time has come.” Part 2, on the other hand, would be established so that projects deemed to be of “national interest are advanced through an accelerated process”. It is about the development of large-scale projects and the following is stated in the bill: The purpose of this Act is to enhance Canada’s prosperity, national security, economic security, national defence and national autonomy by ensuring that projects that are in the national interest are advanced through an accelerated process that enhances regulatory certainty and investor confidence, while protecting the environment and respecting the rights of Indigenous peoples. The government House leader , in his speech, stated, “Through the building Canada act, this bill will simplify federal review and approval processes for major infrastructure projects.” Part 2 of Bill C-5 has nothing to do with internal trade. These two parts of the bill should be treated as two separate bills. In a ruling by Speaker Regan on March 1, 2018, he quoted the following: “The principle or principles contained in a bill must not be confused with the field it concerns. To frame the concept of principle in that way would prevent the division of most bills, because they apply to a specific field.” The former House leader of the Bloc Québécois and former member for La Prairie—Atateken knew of this since it is from page 400 of Parliamentary Procedure in Québec . Speaker Regan continued as follows: While their procedure for dividing bills is quite different from ours, the idea of distinguishing the principles of a bill from its field has stayed with me. While each bill is different and so too each case, I believe that Standing Order 69.1 can indeed be applied to a bill where all of the initiatives relate to a specific policy area, if those initiatives are sufficiently distinct to warrant a separate decision of the House. We find ourselves in a similar situation here. While the measures in Bill C-5 are broadly related to Canada's economy, part 1 is distinct from part 2. Therefore, it would certainly be appropriate to divide part 1 and part 2 of this bill for the vote. The Speaker has that authority, and that would make it possible for members to better represent their constituents by voting separately on these bills, which are quite different from one another. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to your ruling."
"I concur. Although I do not know anything about the detail of that steel and the armour it provided, it is worth bearing in mind the pace of change and our ability to react. We have heard a lot of talk in recent weeks about the capability that we intend to buy, but we have to remember the old adage, which is so true: no plan ever survives first contact with the enemy. That is probably truer now than it has been for many a year. We take our armed forces for granted. Although the jingoistic applause, the veterans' discounts and the ""Thank you for your service"" is not for us--it is too gauche; we are, after all, British--the flip side is that there is certainly some middle ground to be occupied. We need greater societal recognition of the value of serving and an inculcation that service to one's nation is something to be proud of, something to aspire to, and something that benefits not just the country, but the individual. We too often look to our armed forces as a default civil emergency force and the first port of call. If there is flooding, we ask them to deliver sandbags. If it is snowing, we ask them to clear the runway at Heathrow. If firefighters go on strike, we ask our armed forces to man the fire trucks. We also ask them to provide security at the Olympics. Even the bin strikes saw the Army brought in to help. Although I appreciate that there is a specific process by which the help of the armed forces is enlisted, I wince whenever I see it activated. We should not need to rely upon a force of barely 100,000 or so available service personnel to cover everything. They should not be the default bailout for Government or local government ineffectiveness. Our armed forces deserve better. They deserve to be paid properly, so that they do not have to take a pay cut when they are deployed on operations, as was recently explained to me by some of the personnel on NATO operations in Poland; to be housed properly, so that defence contractors do not paint over the mould on the walls because treating it is not on the contractors' checklist, as I have been informed is happening in service family accommodation in my constituency at  the moment; to be posted sympathetically, so that families do not end up split apart if both parents are serving personnel, as I have seen happen to my good friends who are still serving; and to be supported and granted stability, so that service personnel's children can receive a stable home and education. I could go on, but the point I am making is that the treatment of our service personnel is not good enough. Frankly, it was not good enough when I served, it was not good enough under the last Government, and I do not think it is good enough now. While I do not doubt the Government's sentiment, I retain little confidence that the situation will drastically improve, despite the promises. We in this House often stand in this Chamber and wax lyrical about our armed forces, recounting stories of their bravery, courage, commitment and sacrifice. But they are more than just a backdrop for an announcement, and I encourage those of us in this House to remember that. I will make one light-hearted final point. As we Members of Parliament return to our constituencies this weekend to participate dutifully on Saturday and attend the events and parades, spare a thought for those young men and women. As much as I am sure that they value and appreciate the recognition--I remember this well from my own Army experience--the irony is that the best way we could show how much we value them is by not making them work on a sunny Saturday afternoon in June."
I reserve the balance of my time.
"Mr. Chair, we are seeing a great uptake with the housing accelerator fund. Quebec has worked with the federal government to the tune of almost $1 billion, and 26,000 units of affordable housing are the target. We will work to support the Quebec government to deliver on those housing targets."
"Mr. Speaker, there was a vote yesterday, but there is another vote coming in the coming days. That is a vote where we will see the true colours of the Conservatives, because it is on the motion through which we would cut taxes for 22 million Canadians. Canadians who live in the member's riding will be watching at home to see whether the Conservatives will have the backs of Canadians. I can tell the member that we will be watching from this side and Canadians will be watching at home, and we all expect this House to say together that, yes, we have the backs of Canadians and will give them a tax break."
"I thank the Minister for his statement today and for his clear commitment. I want to describe Armed Forces Week in Newtownards in my constituency. On Saturday, 60,000 people came to pay their respects to those who serve in uniform. Whether they serve in the Army, the Air Force or the Royal Navy, they are part of our community, and the community showed its solidarity with them for their courage, bravery and dedication. The hon. Member for North East Derbyshire (Louise Jones) was right, by the way. I met  the lady who will take over at Thiepval Barracks in Lisburn at the end of this year--again, an indication of the commitment of those women and ladies, who can do the job equally well as anybody else. The actions of those criminals at Brize Norton may cause up to PS30 million in damage, as well as the security measures that will have to put in place. However, the true cost of their actions cannot just be measured in money; it is the anger that right-thinking people have towards those pro-Palestine activists who would attack our military to make their political point. They are a threat to those of us who live in this United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This terrorism cannot be accepted. It reminds so many of us--especially those from Northern Ireland--of dark days gone by. Will the Minister acknowledge the righteous anger of the good people of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and what steps will the Minister take to ensure there is not a repeat in Aldergrove, or indeed any other military base with British personnel here or abroad? Some of my Strangford constituents are stationed at these military bases, not just in the United Kingdom but across the whole world."
"Mr. Chair, I am assuming that is a question for the Premier of British Columbia. The best I understand is that it is not an agency of the federal government."
"Mr. Chair, green energy producers say the oil and gas cap deters investment and undermines employment. If the government keeps the cap, is the minister saying that Canada's largest energy investors are wrong?"
"I am simply trying to make the point that many of the amendments proposed seem to set up a false dichotomy between the ability to develop our country, including with housing, and to protect the natural environment. I will give one example of that. Norham parish council in my constituency is trying to open up a plot of land for a small development, because it sees the value of young families moving into the village. That development would go some way towards securing the future of the first school and the community at large. It is not helpful for the parish council to be caught up in red tape, which diminishes the possibility of that development happening. A recent local report said that nearly one in two businesses in rural Northumberland cited a shortage of affordable local housing for staff as a key barrier to business."

"Mr. Chair, that is factually incorrect. This government decriminalized cannabis and did not go beyond that."
"I rise today to congratulate a student from my district, Ms. Alana Karam, on receiving this year's Broward County League of Cities' Scholarship. This prestigious scholarship is awarded each year to a high school senior who has demonstrated a deep investment in public service and intends on leading a life focused on it. Alana is a recent graduate of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where she has distinguished herself in our community through her passion for law, public policy, and civic engagement. Her accomplishments speak volumes, not only about her talents, but also about her character and drive. For her deep intellect and track record of leadership in and out of the classroom, Alana has received well-deserved local and national recognition. She earned first place in the Veterans of Foreign Wars Voice of Democracy Essay Contest and third place in the Federal Bar Association's National High School Essay Contest--both highly competitive national honors--and had her Capstone research project published in the Journal of Student Research, a rare accomplishment at the high school level. Beyond her academic achievements, Alana has been an active member of DECA and several honor societies, and she has sought real-world experience to deepen her understanding of the justice system. During an internship at the Broward County Public Defender's Office, she encountered firsthand the power of advocacy, and the role reaffirmed her desire to dedicate her life to serving her community.  Looking ahead, Alana will attend Georgetown University this fall, where she plans to major in Public Policy or Political Science. She aspires to attend law school and ultimately serve as a public defender, uplifting marginalized voices and contributing meaningfully to the justice system. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in celebrating Ms. Alana Karam for her remarkable accomplishments and meaningful impact on our community."
"Perhaps my question could go through the hon. Member to the Minister if he does not know the answer. The PS740 million is very welcome, but as he says it is frontloaded in one year and then halves the following year, with no indication of where it is going thereafter. Although it may be a welcome short-term intervention, how is it part of a sustainable effort to improve SEN?"
"Mr. Speaker, what is the Government of Canada going to spend on interest payments this fiscal year?"
I ask all of us to join in a moment of silence in honor of Melissa and Mark Hortman.
"I agree that products need to be readily available, and that is one of my recommendations. Secondly, beyond awareness is prevention. We need real understanding, and I want bladder and bowel health to form part of the school syllabus, enmeshed into the curriculum. That is a recommendation from surgeon Dr Robinson from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Let us give teachers the tools to teach it. I want this to form part of the training of all healthcare professionals, so that medical professions understand bladder and bowel care from  their earliest time in the job. We need a specialist workforce that includes physiotherapists, nurses, surgeons and many others. Can the Minister commit to placing this issue high on the agenda for schools, and to building a specialist multidisciplinary workforce who have the relevant skills and knowledge? Thirdly, we need enhanced research and development on bladder and bowel conditions and their treatment. That does not necessarily mean vastly increasing spending; it could mean looking at how resources could be better prioritised. We cannot diagnose, treat and rehabilitate, or look into future medical interventions, if there is limited research. Fourthly--this recommendation is from Dr Ashish Pradhan, chair of the British Society of Urogynaecology --can the Minister commit to banning misleading advertisements that send the wrong message? Products subject to no regulation are advertised, and patients are told to live with their symptoms. Fifthly, I have a recommendation from a patient I met, Leanne. Could we have a one-stop shop in which all services are under one roof, care that is closer to home, and cheaper incontinence products? They are exempt from VAT if they are purchased for personal use, or use by a registered charity, but what if they are purchased by care homes? Those are my five demands, backed by experts--five things that will ensure real progress. I look forward to the Minister's response. Lastly, let me say this to men, women, young people and children listening to this debate: you are not alone, and there is no shame. This subject is often surrounded by silence. It is a subject that people do not want to talk about, or do not know about, and that the NHS does not do enough about. That ends now, and it ends here."
"Diolch yn fawr, Mr Llefarydd. Green energy deserves green transmission, so will the Minister commit to undergrounding any new electric transmission in Wales?"

"Mr. Speaker, nobody believes them. After 10 years of the Liberals, our warships are rusting out, our fighter jets are worn out, and our troops are burnt out. Today, the Canadian Armed Forces is short 13,000 troops, due to the Liberals' recruitment and retention crisis. An additional 10,000 personnel are under-trained and non-deployable. Over the past decade, the Liberals lapsed $12 billion in defence spending and cut $2.7 billion from the military over the last year. Why would our troops believe anything the Liberal government says, since the Liberals are responsible for breaking our military?"
"there are good days and bad days in this building. Today, we have a little bit of a happy day and sad day in the Grothman office. John Nagle, part of my policy shop, is leaving today. He is a great guy. He is the pride of Poway, California. While it is our loss, it is going to be the gain of the Pacific Legal Foundation. I will say one more time, I thank John for all the help he has given me. He is welcome to come back to our office again and again when he is on the Hill."

"Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague on his discourse and his speech in the House, and to welcome him. I have a bit of a concern, because I think about so many people in this country who are living with a disability and who did not see their concerns echoed within the throne speech. I wonder whether the member, while he was talking to his constituents, heard from constituents who are deeply concerned that $250 is simply insufficient to help people living with a disability stay out of poverty. Will the government be taking the necessary steps to protect Canadians living with a disability, particularly in my province of Alberta, where the provincial government has taken $200 off, with the—"
"Mr. Chair, let us talk about the main estimates for 2025-26."
"The hon. Lady is right to raise this issue. Components of the SCM criteria are planned in both the core awards and the supplementary route, and those in receipt of SCM payments can continue to receive those payments under the infected blood support schemes route. However, as I said in my evidence to the inquiry only a few weeks ago, that is a matter that I will consider further."
I will take my right hon. Friend's well-informed observations into account. I will take the observations of his Select Committee into account. I welcome the attention he has given to this review as we develop our thinking for the defence industrial strategy.
"I found the Leader of the Opposition incredibly disappointing, so goodness knows what those on her own Benches think. While she is talking Britain down, may I commend the Prime Minister for the leadership he has shown this week? Could he say a little more about how businesses in the defence supply chain, particularly in the Teesside defence and innovation cluster, can contribute to the national mission for defence and security?"
"A point that has not yet been made is the importance of credit unions and access to responsible lending. One thing that people can do at a high street bank but cannot do at a banking hub is get a loan, so I am grateful to the hon. Member for mentioning credit unions. In my area, Nationwide on the A6 in Hazel Grove has shut, which is having a massive impact on what people can do beyond access to cash."
"Mr. Chair, the Liberals are not committing to restoring that aspect, which they repealed. Will they make arson an aggravating factor in extortion? Arson is used as a weapon in many of these cases. Will the Liberals make arson an aggravating factor?"
"While Border Force does not routinely disclose information of a port-specific nature, in the calendar year of 2024 it seized approximately 300,000 e-cigarettes and vapes at the UK border. Border Force has a robust approach to seizures, based on intelligence received from its partners. I know that my hon. Friend has raised this issue previously, and I am very happy to meet with her to discuss it."
"Mr. Chair, it is relevant because it was forestry, fishing, mining, quarrying, and oil and gas workers in Canada who lost the most jobs of any sectors in the entire Canadian economy since May last year and over the past last lost anti-development Liberal decade."
"which Elon Musk should we believe? In February, he called the U.S. Agency of International Development, USAID, ``corrupt'', ``beyond repair,'' and ``a ball of worms'' that needs to be eliminated. He claimed that there is a ``gigantic fraud loophole'' where government funds given to NGOs lack sufficient oversight. In March, Elon Musk called Social Security ``the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,'' and policy followed his comments. Then this week he said that: ``If the massive deficit spending continues, there will only be money for interest payments and nothing else: no Social Security, no medical, no defense, nothing.'' This week he said about the big, ugly bill: ``I am sorry, but I just can't standit anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.'' Which Elon Musk do you believe? The erratic rhetoric and policies of this administration are becoming clear to all who watch."
"Mr. Speaker, the NDP agrees to apply the vote and will be voting against."

"last week, our Nation lost a revolutionary business leader, a committed philanthropist, an incredible Tennessean; his name, Fred Smith. Like all great leaders, Fred had a vision for a better future, and he did everything possible to make it happen. That is why, in 1973, he founded FedEx with a simple yet bold idea: improve overnight delivery. Today, we take instant shipping for granted in many ways. It is the engine of our global economy, but back then, it was not considered to be a practical or workable idea. So it took Fred to make it happen. He pioneered innovations in transportation and logistics, and those pioneering innovations have defined the industry ever since. He truly led the way, and it was not easy. But with his commitment to excellence, he grew FedEx into a $53 billion company that employs half a million people, connects more than 220 countries and territories, and moves more than 17 million shipments each and every day. Even with his global accomplishments, Fred never lost sight of home. He based his company in his hometown of Memphis, turning the city into a center for global logistics. And through his philanthropic support for education, community programs, arts, healthcare, and more, he always found ways to give back to his community and to make Memphis a better place. In many ways, service truly defined his life. Before founding FedEx, Fred served for 4 years in the U.S. Marine Corps, including two tours in Vietnam. He was decorated with a Silver Star, Bronze Star, and two Purple Hearts. But for Fred, the greatest honor was serving alongside his troops as a company commander. In an interview last year, Fred recounted a time when the men in his company dug his foxhole for him so that he could get more rest.  They were as tired or more tired, but they took their energy to take care of me. And it was one of the best things that ever happened to me, because it told me they cared for me, they appreciated my leadership.  We should all be grateful for Fred Smith and that he chose a life of leadership and service. On behalf of all Tennesseans, I extend my heartfelt condolences to Fred's beloved wife Diane, his nine children, and his entire family. Mr. President, as if in legislative session and notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask unanimous consent, the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 308, which is at the desk."
"I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in recess until 3 p.m. on Friday, June 27; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each; further, that if Senator Kaine makes a motion to discharge S.J. Res. 59 from the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Senate vote on the motion to discharge at 6 p.m."
"Mr. Chair, for operational reasons, I probably should not be answering that question."
"Mr. Speaker, I am concerned. The member mentioned something we hear and see often, which is that there is too much discretion left to federal ministers within almost every piece of legislation the government brings forth. Of course, we are dealing with lobbying and insider deals and all this type of thing, and yet, when it comes to these projects, a major projects office will be put in place that aims to coordinate between the different departments required for project reviews. This, to me, says that at that point, the provinces are out of the picture. Should they be part of this decision-making for clear transparency on what is happening within these supposed projects that are being put forward nationally?"
I call Perran Moon.
"Mr. Speaker, I am thankful to the member for her focus on our Canadian military. We truly are proud of it, and we want to support it in the best way as we can. However, I am a bit curious. The member states that she wants to give the military the tools and the resources it needs to do its job, yet the Liberals cancelled the F-35 contract. At the very best, that is going to be a delay. How do you respond to that, with your passion to give it the tools it needs and then cancelling the contract for jets we desperately need?"
"Oh, oh!"
"Mr. Speaker, we take note of last night's motion, but what Canadians deserve and Canadian provinces deserve is a health care transfer, a transfer for child care, a transfer for dental care and a transfer to support affordability. That is what is in the main estimates, and we expect the support of the members opposite."
"Mr. Speaker, as the Minister of Finance, I always want to see revenues grow because revenues allow us to deliver services to Canadians. Obviously, we will continue to be fiscally prudent but, at the same time, look at ways to support Canadians."
"Mr. Chair, do the top five countries competing with Canada in mining have an industrial carbon tax?"
"My hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that we need a focus on women's health. Our priority is turning the commitments in the women's health strategy into tangible actions, such as by setting out how we will eliminate cervical cancer by 2040 through the new cervical cancer plan. We have taken urgent action, through our elective reform plan, to support the nearly 600,000 women who are on gynaecology waiting lists."
"Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the Minister of Northern and Arctic Affairs . It is a true pleasure to contribute to this important debate on the wildfires in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. I truly want to thank the member for Winnipeg Centre for proposing the debate this evening. Not only is it important, but I also very much appreciate hearing the stories and the experiences of those who have been impacted, and all of those who are trying hard to resolve the issue. I am the very proud member of Parliament for the constituency of Davenport. It is located in downtown west Toronto. While we do not have the kind of wildfires that we are now seeing in western Canada, we are also very much impacted by the wildfires. In our local newspaper in Toronto today, it said, “Wildfire smoke from Western Canada and Northwest Ontario is spreading to Toronto, causing hazy skies and potentially health hazardous air quality.” In saying this, I know that in no way, by any stretch of the imagination, is what we are experiencing in Toronto anywhere near what is happening right now in western Canada or the impact on the many communities currently experiencing active wildfires. I want to begin by saying a heartfelt thank you to the Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience . I want to say thanks to the Minister of Indigenous Services who spoke earlier this evening. I want to thank them for their respective leadership. I am very proud of not only their leadership, but also their quick action and their compassionate and culturally appropriate support. I am also proud of the work Canada is doing to support those impacted by the wildfires in each province. Our thoughts are with Canadians from coast to coast to coast who are once again facing the devastating impacts of severe climate events, including the wildfires currently affecting Manitoba, Saskatchewan and surrounding regions. People have been forced to flee their homes, many from remote and northern indigenous communities. These are not abstract figures. We are talking about families and entire communities facing danger, hardship and uncertainty. Climate events are displacing families and challenging our emergency response systems in ways Canada has not experienced until recently. I join all members of the House in expressing deep gratitude to the firefighters, first responders, volunteers and members of the Canadian Armed Forces who are working tirelessly to protect lives and communities during this incredibly challenging time. I am pleased and relieved to share that, over the weekend, the Canadian Coast Guard helicopters were deployed to support the evacuation efforts in Manitoba. Once again, I want to thank my colleague the Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience for her leadership in coordinating the federal response to this crisis. On May 28, the province of Manitoba submitted a request for federal assistance due to wildfire impacts. The next day, on May 29, the Canadian Armed Forces mobilized up to 18 aircraft to assist and immediately begin evacuating communities at risk, particularly the Mathias Colomb first nation's approximately 3,500 residents. On May 30, the Canadian Coast Guard joined the evacuation effort and mobilized an additional two helicopters, which were operational as of June 1. Led by Public Safety Canada, various departments, including Indigenous Services Canada, Transport Canada, Public Services and Procurement Canada, and the Public Health Agency, all contributed to both the evacuation of communities and the care of the host communities to which they were relocated. In addition, non-governmental organizations, such as the Canadian Red Cross, the Search and Rescue Volunteer Association of Canada and St. John Ambulance, played an important and vital role, while dynamic weather and smoky conditions in the area continued to challenge evacuation efforts. From May 29 to June 2, 3,612 people were evacuated and brought to safety from Mathias Colomb, Cross Lake and Norway House. Sadly, Canada is currently facing approximately 180 active wildfires nationally, with 72 classified as out of control. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre has arranged for out-of-province domestic and international surge support to firefighting efforts in Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Nunavut. The Canadian Coast Guard is part of the integrated whole-of-government federal response system. Our marine and air assets are deployed in coordination with other departments to maximize impact and meet the needs of Canadians. As emergency management in Canada is a shared responsibility, our systems are built on partnerships, co-operation and respect for jurisdictional roles. Provinces and territories lead in response to emergencies within their jurisdictional mandate, and the federal government supports them when the situation exceeds their capacity or when specific federal assistance is requested. As a national government, our role is clear. We are to respond swiftly and effectively to requests for federal assistance from provinces and territories when asked and stand with Canadians in times of need. Our government has responded with urgency and a coordinated whole-of-government approach. This is not just about responding to requests for assistance or respecting jurisdictional roles, but about supporting each other as people and as Canadians. Our government is working closely with provincial authorities, indigenous leadership, local governments and non-governmental partners, such as the Canadian Red Cross, to ensure that the federal response is not only timely but also integrated and responsive to the realities our communities are confronting. Beyond delivering its own programs, the Canadian Coast Guard plays a vital role in supporting the mandates of other federal organizations during major incidents, such as wildfires, floods and other natural disasters. As a first responder agency, it contributes air and marine resources, emergency management expertise, and humanitarian support, including assistance to community evacuations. I will give members a few examples. In response to record snowfalls in Sydney, Nova Scotia, in February 2024, the Canadian Coast Guard cadets and helicopters swiftly acted following a request for federal assistance from the Province of Nova Scotia. Another example is when, in the summer of 2023, the Canadian Coast Guard supported the Northwest Territories in responding to the devastating wildfires threatening Hay River and Yellowknife. Finally, in the aftermath of hurricane Fiona's destruction across the Atlantic provinces in 2022, the Canadian Coast Guard was there to support Canadians in need. In the face of climate-driven emergencies, our commitment is to not only respond and support but also adapt. Our government is working to strengthen Canada's emergency systems to meet these evolving challenges and increase our country's collective resilience as it will continue to face increasingly severe climate events. The amount and frequency of climate-related disasters has placed growing demands on the Canadian Coast Guard's response capabilities, but by leveraging investments from the oceans protection plan, the Canadian Coast Guard is amplifying its capacity through community partnerships and enhanced training and exercises. The government also remains committed to advancing reconciliation and supporting indigenous self-determination through partnerships that enable indigenous communities to participate in marine response planning and emergency preparedness. We are building a more inclusive and resilient response system. I would also say that interoperability is a core principle in emergency management. A cohesive response is only possible when all partners can communicate effectively, operate within compatible systems and understand each other's capabilities. That is why we continue to invest in joint training exercises, shared information platforms and harmonized response protocols. Finally, our commitment goes beyond the current crisis. We are working to build a Canada that is not only capable of responding to today's emergency but also prepared for tomorrow's floods, storms, extreme heat and other climate-driven emergencies. This involves aligning emergency management planning with climate adaptation strategies to withstand extreme weather events and equip indigenous partners with the necessary tools to protect communities. In times of crisis, Canadians come together to show the strength of our partnerships, the depth of our compassion and the resilience that defines us as Canadians."
"I am here to ask unanimous consent ona very simple measure to make sure that the data systems of Social Security were not compromised--that no data was exfiltrated, no bugs were infiltrated, and no back doors were left in when Elon Musk and his little gang of miscreants went into Social Security. I will talk more about this afterward, but the chairman of the Finance Committee has elsewhere to be. So I will speak after I have offered this, and he has responded. I will go directly to my unanimous consent request. As if in legislative session, and notwithstanding rule XXII, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of my bill, S. 1943, introduced earlier today; that the bill be considered read three times and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table."
"Oh, oh!"
"I think one of the key problems with this form of intervention, compared with others, is that we cannot ask the patients afterwards how that felt. We cannot get their feedback, because they are dead. If we are going to give them things such as neuromuscular blockers or sedatives, we may not be able to tell what they feel. There are physiological ways in which we can monitor patients and get some idea--perhaps in their heart rate or blood pressure--but we will not be doing that. That is, therefore, one of the reasons for my tabling the amendments, to ensure that the drugs are properly regulated by the MHRA, so that we know that they have been properly tested on the purpose for which they are to be used."
"It is a pleasure to follow the shadow Minister. I thank all right hon. and hon. Members who have spoken. As I mentioned right at the beginning, the Bill is extremely narrow in its scope and intent, focusing solely on closing a loophole in the existing deprivation of citizenship process. As I outlined, the Supreme Court decided in a recent case that if an appeal against a deprivation decision is successful, or a deprivation of citizenship order is withdrawn, that initial order will have had no effect and the person will be considered as having continued to be British. That means that people who have been deprived of British citizenship will automatically regain that status before further avenues of appeal have been exhausted. The Bill will therefore protect the UK from people who pose a threat to our national security by preventing those who have been deprived of British citizenship and are overseas from returning until all appeals have been determined. It will also prevent a person who has been deprived of citizenship on the grounds that it is conducive to the public good from seeking to undermine deprivation action while an appeal in their case remains ongoing by renouncing their other nationality and putting themselves in a position whereby a deprivation order would render them stateless. The Bill does not change any existing right of appeal or widen the reasons for which a person could be deprived of their citizenship. It is crucial that our world-class law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the necessary powers to protect the public and secure our borders. Let me reflect briefly on the contributions made during the debate. I am very grateful to the Opposition Front Benchers for their support and their speeches. It is always my intention that national security should  never be a party political issue. That was the basis on which I approached it in opposition, and that is the basis on which I approach it in government. I am very grateful for the constructive and reasonable way in which they have presented their points today. I am also grateful to the Liberal Democrat spokesperson, the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Lisa Smart), for her contribution. She took the opportunity, as is absolutely her right, to call for wider reform, and she raised specific concerns about the process and about transparency. The Government believe that the measures in the Bill are necessary and proportionate, but I listened carefully to the points that she made about transparency. The Government believe that there is sufficient oversight and transparency of the use of the deprivation power. The Home Office publishes data in relation to the number of deprivation of citizenship orders, and the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration has the remit to review the power. The ICIBI has conducted independent reviews of the deprivation power, with reports published relatively recently, in 2018 and in 2024. I also want to take the opportunity to further reassure the hon. Lady that deprivation decisions are made following careful consideration of advice, both from officials and from lawyers and, under this Government--I am sure it was the case under previous Governments as well--strictly in accordance with international law. Each case is assessed individually by the Home Secretary, and decisions to deprive, where it is conducive to the public good, are taken by the Home Secretary, and the Home Secretary alone. The power is used sparingly, it complies with the UN convention on the reduction of statelessness and it always comes with the right to appeal. My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Josh Simons) made a thoughtful speech, including about what citizenship means, and I know that the House will be grateful for the contribution that he made this evening. My hon. Friend the Member for Clapham and Brixton Hill (Bell Ribeiro-Addy) raised a number of specific concerns, and I want to do my best to respond to them. The deprivation of citizenship on conducive grounds is rightly reserved for those who pose a threat to the UK or whose conduct involves a very high harm. Deprivation on fraud grounds is for those who obtained their citizenship fraudulently, so were never entitled to it in the first place. Decisions are made following careful consideration of advice from officials and--in respect of conducive deprivations--lawyers, and in accordance with international law, including the UN convention on the reduction of statelessness. The Government take these matters very seriously, and I hope that my hon. Friend will understand that we have to ensure that we have the powers necessary to keep the public safe."
"Mr. Speaker, the member's question was very thoughtful. The fact of the matter is, we are taking action now. The piece of legislation before us has the support of all the largest law enforcement organizations in the country. When the Canadian Police Association, which is the voice of 60,000 frontline officers, and our national security agencies all commend the tools that are in the bill, we know we are on the right path. We are taking action, and I am very proud of the tools it would give our law enforcement agencies and our national security agencies to go after the bad guys."
"Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that. The Liberals over here do not believe in the freedom of choice that Canadians should have when it comes to the vehicle they drive. Right now, they have a mandate in place that makes it so Canadians will have to buy EVs. They will have to, but that does not fit the needs of Canadian families. Especially at this time when Canadian families are struggling to make ends meet, they cannot afford the additional $20,000 that this mandate would add to their bill when they go to purchase a new car. Right now, the government has an option, and that is to vote with Conservatives to relinquish the ban on gas-powered vehicles. Will they vote with us?"
"Mr. Chair, after 10 years of Liberal governments, their housing record boils down to double trouble: doubled rents, doubled down payments and doubled mortgage costs. Who does the Prime Minister then appoint as housing minister? It is the former mayor of Vancouver, who doubled housing prices and broke promises to end homelessness. I have a few questions for the minister. Does the minister know the average price of a single detached home in Nanaimo?"
"I am sorry to interrupt such a magnificent speech. The first Pride march in London was in 1972, and I have met many people who were on that first Pride march who thought that they would never need to march again, but they still need to march now. Does my hon. Friend feel sorry that Pride  organisations have now said that no political parties are allowed to march because of how the LGBTQI+ community has been treated? I will still be marching, because I march with other groups, but does my hon. Friend agree that this is a sad state of affairs?"
"Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his scholarly presentation. I would also like to take this opportunity to greet his family members, who are here on the Hill today. At the end of his speech, my colleague said something very important. He said that it is important to study the estimates, because it is the role of Parliament and, by extension, that of the opposition, to serve as a check on the government and its spending. After what my colleague just said, I wonder if he feels uncomfortable being part of a government that introduced Bill C-5 , which is not even split up and in which the government, with the help of the Conservatives, is taking away the ability of Parliament and committees to exercise oversight and conduct a detailed analysis of such a substantial bill. How can they not be uncomfortable saying such a thing about the estimates and doing something completely different for everything else, under the pretext that one line in the Liberal election platform mentioned what is in Bill C-5? I would like my colleague to tell me about the feelings and emotions he experiences when he tells us contradictory things like that."
"This is a challenging and difficult time for the workers and their families at Alexander Dennis, as well as for the local area. As Members would expect, I have engaged extensively with ADL's senior executives alongside the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Department for Transport and the First Minister of Scotland to discuss what we can do to support. We wrote jointly to the company, offering to support it in any way we can. There are many issues that we tried to talk through with its representatives. Bus manufacturing sits with the Department for Transport, so it is taking the lead, but we are working together to do what we can."
"South Shropshire residents would expect high street crime to be dealt with, and proportionate sentencing and appropriate deterrents. How will removing short-term prison sentences achieve any of that?"
The hon. member for Mirabel.
"Madam Speaker, I congratulate the new member for South Surrey—White Rock and want to thank his predecessor, Kerry-Lynne Findlay, who, for many years, represented the riding in a dedicated and excellent fashion. The member talked about solutions. One solution that would be very much appreciated by Canadians would be the removal of the GST or the carbon tax for small businesses and industries, because they are, essentially, self-imposed tariffs on ourselves, which brings much less competition with the States. I wonder if the member would comment on this, as we are actually harming ourselves by maintaining the carbon tax on our businesses."
I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.
"On the point the hon. Lady makes about her constituents, the length and breadth of this country is filled by people who do their bit and go above and beyond. Will the hon. Lady join me in congratulating the people in my constituency who do exactly that?"
"Mr. Speaker, once again, I will go back to the fact that, last week, we had a moment of incredible unity with the premiers and the Prime Minister together, sitting down and talking about how we build national interest projects. That is what we will be supporting, because that is what Canadians want to see from us."
"I believe my hon. Friend is due happy birthday wishes, so let me take that opportunity, and thank him, too, for his tireless campaigning for locating the laboratories in Harlow. The facilities are an important capability for the United Kingdom. A decision has been awaited for some years; I am not ready to announce it today, but people will not have too long to wait before it is announced."
"The Minister for Social Security and Disability and I have met many disabled organisations. In fact, he has spoken to many already about the review. We will continue to discuss with them precisely how the system of co-production will work, but I want to assure my hon. Friend that it is serious. We want to make sure people's views and voices are heard, and I encourage him, as a Member of Parliament, to get involved in the process too."
"Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is in Saskatchewan today meeting with all the premiers. We have been hearing what I think is a clear consensus for some time now. More and more calls to build pipelines and energy infrastructure are being heard. Quebeckers want a pipeline. The only problem is the federal government. Building energy projects strengthens our economy, reduces our dependence on the United States and provides a powerful pay cheque for our workers. Will the Liberal government approve the building of pipelines in Canada today?"
"Mr. Speaker, of course, our EV sector, our auto sector, is very important, especially in my neck of the woods. In Brampton, we have Stellantis, right in my riding. I think it is important that we continue to support the workers and the industry through innovation and through—"
"We made available an additional PS5 billion as part of the settlement, and PS3.7 billion of that was for social care. We understand the pressures and we are directing money to address them, but we know that this issue will take more than one year to fix. We are on with the fair funding review--the third multi-year settlement in a decade--to begin to fix the foundations. We have definitely heard calls from rural communities and councils to take into account the additional cost for rurality and remoteness, and I assure the hon. Lady that those issues are being looked at."
"I welcome the increase to defence spending and the revised targets. Earlier this year, at the spring statement, we saw cuts to official development assistance--the overseas aid budget--to fund defence increases. The ODA budget is integral to our international security abroad, so will the Prime Minister rule out any further cuts to this budget for defence spending increases?"
"A message from Her Excellency the Governor General transmitting supplementary estimates (A) for the financial year ending March 31, 2026, was presented by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada and read by the Speaker to the House."
"I thank my hon. Friends for their speeches and stories from their constituents. They have been incredibly insightful as well as heartbreaking, but that is exactly why we are here. I am sincerely grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Helen Hayes) for giving us the opportunity to bring the House together to honour the Windrush generation, and those whose courage, resilience, and extraordinary contribution helped rebuild post-war Britain. Let us be clear: they answered a call. They worked hard and grafted, and they helped to shape the very fabric of the country we know today. We see examples of that generation's legacy in Wolverhampton, embodied in the life and work of so many people, like Professor Mel Chevannes--an inspirational role model who, when elected in 1981 as the city's first African-Caribbean councillor, went on to chair the social services committee and later became the first African-Caribbean chair of the Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust. Her leadership, her service, and her example not only opened doors but shattered glass ceilings. This weekend, Wolverhampton will pay a lasting tribute to Professor Chevannes with the unveiling of a bronze bust--a permanent reminder of the power of representation and the enduring contribution of the Windrush generation to our public life. Today is not only about celebration; it is also about justice, because for too many the Windrush story includes real pain. The Windrush scandal inflicted deep harm on people who had every right to live here--people who built their lives here and served our communities, but were betrayed by a system that refused to see their humanity. We saw that pain in the story of the late Paulette Wilson--a Wolverhampton resident, and a cook who once worked in Parliament, in this very House. Paulette came to Britain as a child and spent more than 50 years here, but in 2015 she received a letter declaring her an illegal immigrant. She was made homeless, her benefits were stopped, and in 2017 she was detained and sent to Heathrow for deportation to a country she had not seen in half a century. With the swift action of my predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Emma Reynolds), who was Paulette's MP at that time, working alongside the Refugee and Migrant Centre in Wolverhampton, and with Paulette's strong determination, she fought back and she won. She was granted leave to remain. But more than that: she chose to speak out, becoming a voice for so many others who had suffered in silence. Her courage helped expose the systematic injustice at the heart of the Windrush scandal and force change. In 2021, a plaque was proudly placed at the Wolverhampton Heritage Centre, once the office where Enoch Powell wrote his divisive ""rivers of blood"" speech but now a thriving symbol of African-Caribbean heritage and real community spirit. I welcome the fact that this Labour Government are forging ahead to deliver justice, launching a PS1.5 million advocacy fund, re-establishing the Windrush unit, significantly reducing the time taken to allocate claims, and beginning the recruitment of a Windrush commissioner to ensure victims' voices remain at the heart of Government policy. Windrush should not just be a chapter in our history; it has to be a call for action to challenge us to build a country grounded in fairness, shaped by justice and defined by a true sense of belonging for all. I commend the courage and resilience of Paulette and all our Windrush generation--the thousands of others who faced this rogue injustice--and hope that such atrocities can never happen again."
"Mr. Speaker, I would advise my Liberal colleagues from Quebec to listen to voters. The government cheated us out of $800 million by giving all Canadians a carbon tax rebate even though that tax had not been collected. I am not convinced that the people who voted for the Liberal Party are happy today. With Bill C‑5 , the government is proposing to build infrastructure that will not have any impact whatsoever on Quebec. On the two major industries in Quebec hit by tariffs, the government has remained silent. If I were in my colleague's shoes, I would do some soul searching and I would realize that someone has dropped the ball somewhere."
"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1948, as amended, bipartisan legislation to assist the U.S. section of the International Boundary and Water Commission, or IBWC, in carrying out its critical water- related missions. This bill allows IBWC to accept contributed funds from other Federal and State agencies, giving the Commission the authority other Federal infrastructure agencies already have. This authority will allow the IBWC to partner with other Federal agencies and non-Federal interests to carry out critical water-related projects, including projects for wastewater treatment, water conservation, and flood control. I support H.R. 1948, as amended, and urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."
"As we are discussing the armed services' recruitment problems, does my hon. Friend agree it is very helpful that this Government were able to deliver an above-inflation pay rise of 4.5% for service personnel, recognising their extraordinary professionalism? In combination with last year's 6% headline award, that represents a cumulative pay award of 10.5% since July 2024, which can only help with the issues he is discussing."
"Mr. Speaker, judging from that speech, I guess it explains the member's position and why Pierre Poilievre actually called community housing and co-op housing “Soviet-style” housing. I get that, because, according to the member's speech, he seems to be alleging that anything to do with supporting the community on the whole is communism. The member says he supports tax cuts, so let me ask him a question. The craft brewery community and distilleries are hit with an unfair excise tax. In fact, it is one that should be changed. My question for the member is this: Would he support changing the excise tax, the tax rate, so that Canadian domestic craft brewers and distillers would not have to pay the same rate as the two largest foreign-owned businesses here in Canada operating in the industry?"
"Mr. Speaker, again, I would refer to the main estimates. Currently, that is about 10%. That is all I can say."
"The UN children in conflict report showed that violence against children increased by 25% last year, and that does not even include what is going on this year. The Israeli Government are listed as the most prolific perpetrator of grave violations against children for the second year running, making Gaza the most dangerous place on earth to be a child. What specific steps is the Foreign Secretary taking to protect children in conflict in Gaza and elsewhere, such as in Somalia and Haiti?"
Agreed. On division.
I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.
"I rise today in opposition to Trump's rescission package, which includes an unfathomable $8.2 billion cut to USAID funding. My home State of North Carolina is the fourth largest recipient of USAID funding, which invests roughly $194 million into our State economy. Gutting this support threatens local jobs, weakens our research institutions, and undermines the economic stability of communities across my State. In my district alone, the damaging effects of the administration's cuts to USAID are already being felt. Thousands of talented professionals have lost their jobs, and vital partnerships with our local universities have been terminated. These devastating cuts are not only costing people their livelihoods here at home but are also putting lives at risk around the world. USAID is a cornerstone of our national security, advancing global health, powering research across the country, and reinforcing America's leadership on the world stage. Slashing this funding will be disastrous for our allies, destabilize vulnerable regions, and hurt communities. We cannot stand for it."
"Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech by our colleague, who spoke about the opposition motion, which we have now finished debating. I would ask him whether he has anything to say about the main estimates, since that is what we are looking at now. I realize that, as part of the study of the main estimates and the supplementary estimates, we can talk about various subjects, but I have not heard much about the budget here. I would like my colleague to talk about spending."
"I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Correa) for yielding and for his leadership on the Border Security and Enforcement Subcommittee of the Committee on Homeland Security. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security already vets everyone it encounters entering the United States. Most of these encounters are routine, but some of these encounters require more investigation based on a dynamic assessment of the security situation. Now, DHS does not publicly release who is getting enhanced screening or where it may be happening right now, simply because: First, merely being singled out for enhanced screening does not necessarily mean an individual poses a threat or has done something illegal; and, second, doing so would let bad actors know who DHS is on the lookout for. That information, in other words, is law-enforcement sensitive. H.R. 275, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's tipping off terrorists act, requires DHS to make public information it has long deemed law-enforcement sensitive. That is because this bill requires Customs and Border Protection to publicly report who is getting extra screening and where that screening occurs in real time, which tips off terrorists and other bad actors. Under administrations of both parties, DHS has never regularly published who it has considered a special interest alien. That is because who is considered special interest changes regularly based on DHS' security assessments. This bill lets bad actors know in real time which nationalities are more likely to get enhanced screening and exactly where CBP has been stopping these migrants. Criminal organizations could then use this information to adjust their operations and try to avoid enhanced CBP inspections. However, Democrats are for transparency, as Mr. Correa has already said, and there is nothing stopping DHS right now from publishing these numbers. The Trump administration also could publish this data right now if they wanted to but continue to choose not to because the folks on the ground understand that security threats posed by such public reporting is bad. If Republicans want the administration to publish information on who is getting enhanced screening, they should work with DHS to do so in a way that does not jeopardize Homeland Security, not with a messaging bill, which, if signed by the President, could tip off terrorists. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this dangerous bill."
"The procurement of the F-35As and the next tranche of F-35Bs will support 20,000 jobs across the UK, with over 100 UK-based suppliers contributing to the F-35 programme. That demonstrates yet again that defence can be an engine for growth, because these are good jobs across all parts of the nations and regions of the UK, including in my hon. Friend's constituency."
"Mr. Speaker, does the minister agree that LNG is the cleanest-burning fossil fuel in the world and helps replace dirtier emissions worldwide, contributing to international climate goals?"
"My hon. Friend speaks powerfully about the desperate need for more social and affordable homes in all our communities, including those in Bolton. That multi-year commitment and PS39 billion of investment will help us to build the social and affordable homes that our country desperately needs, and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government will work with local authorities to bring forward those plans and get Britain building the homes that we need."
"My hon. Friend is absolutely right to focus on the need for face-to-face banking in communities and high streets up and down the country. We are committed to working with the banks to roll out 350 banking hubs by the end of this Parliament, but we also think that the Post Office can do more to help to improve access to banking services. On the particular issue in his constituency, if it would be helpful, I would be very happy to sit down and talk to him about what else he might be able to do to secure a banking hub for his constituents."
"Mr. Chair, there has been a crisis in the forestry sector since 2017. We have never seen the government undertake serious negotiations. The U.S. government is threatening to increase countervailing duties to 34% next year. The only natural resource sector with the potential to reduce Canada's carbon footprint is the forestry sector. I have the following question for the minister: Would he agree to implement a liquidity program to support the forestry sector?"
"Mr. Chair, in your previous role as the parliamentary secretary to former justice minister Lametti and your brief two-month appointment as justice minister this year, have you ever attended a courthouse to observe a bail hearing?"
We will continue with questions and comments. The hon. member for London West has the floor.
"I thank my hon. Friend for her question, and I understand her concerns. I reassure her that the Government will always act in the national interest on  these issues. Thames Water must meet its statutory and regulatory obligations to its customers and to the environment--it is only right that the company is subject to the same consequences as any other water company. The company remains financially stable, but we have stepped up our preparations and stand ready for all eventualities, as I have said before, including a special administration regime, if that were to become necessary."
"The hon. minister, a brief response."
"Mr. Speaker, Canada had a balanced, effective immigration system. It worked for newcomers, Canadians and our country. However, after 10 years of the Liberal government, the system is in chaos. Liberals ignored warnings, cut corners on application vetting, and opened doors for fraud and abuse in the temporary foreign worker, refugee and international student programs. Now over a million people are here with expired visas or expiring visas, and there is still no plan to address it. Canada now has the highest population growth in the G7, and the OECD confirms that the high immigration is straining our housing, our jobs and our health care. Despite this, the Liberals issued 180,000 temporary foreign worker permits this year alone, a 10% increase from last quarter. This is not sustainable. Canadians know it. The OECD and the Bank of Canada know it. Why do the Liberals not know it?"
"At the Home Affairs Committee, we have heard worrying evidence about unaccompanied children arriving in this country and being placed in wholly unsuitable accommodation, including staying in rooms with adult males, which presents safeguarding risks. Clearly, there are issues about the age assessment process at the border and the responsibility of the contractors who organise the accommodation. Will the Minister tell the House what steps the Government are taking to ensure children in this country are safe?"
"I beg to move, That this House recognises the importance of banking facilities to local communities and expresses concern over the precipitous decline over the past 40 years; notes the change to banking habits through online services; further recognises that, for vulnerable people, face-to-face banking is a vital service and a reduction of branches risks significant financial exclusion; further notes the impact of a loss of physical banking on small businesses through lost productivity and lost footfall; also notes the innovative nature of banking hubs as a solution to a loss of high street banking, but recognises that Financial Conduct Authority rules for their recommendation are too inflexible; and calls on the Government to instigate a review into the impact on communities of bank branch loss and a change to the regulations to ensure communities have appropriate access to banking facilities. On 26 February, I held a debate in Westminster Hall on high street banking and bank closures. Despite the fact that it was only a 30-minute debate, it was incredibly well attended. Such was the demand for a debate on the issues facing almost every community and constituency that, at its conclusion, I was urged to apply for a Backbench Business debate--so here we are this afternoon. I want to put on record my thanks to the Committee for granting such an important debate and to all the Members across the House who co-signed my application, in particular the right hon. Member for Tatton (Esther McVey), who co-sponsored it. This debate, like the previous one, is timely. There has been a precipitous decline in banking provision in the UK over a period of four decades. It has been partially driven by the rapid advances in technology, which have seen a huge uptake of internet banking, but we should not kid ourselves--it has also been driven by a desire from banks still raking in enormous profits to centralise and cut costs, with no regard for the communities they purport to serve. Communities are being sacrificed at the altar of greed, at the behest of banks that no longer see the services they provide as profitable, and as is so often the case, the elderly, the disabled and the poor, who either cannot cope with computers or cannot afford expensive broadband, are the ones who have been hit the hardest. Moreover, the closures have further eroded local economies, with fewer visits to the high street being made and local businesses having additional costs linked to such practicalities as making cash deposits."
"I cannot remember whether my hon. Friend was in the debate on the Bus Services (No. 2) Bill, but there will be more opportunities to make those points. As she says very well, it is one thing to look at the structures through the Bill, but for many areas, unless the funding is in place, the buses are not there. It is interesting that she mentions the 65: I also have a local battle about the 65 bus. However, that battle is within the context of Transport for London, a regulated transport network, so we have a level of accountability, expectation and information about our buses that was stripped out in the 1980s by the Thatcher Government, when buses outside London were deregulated. We must ensure that there are strategic objectives underlying the Government's buses policy, funding and fares approach. We welcome the retention of the PS3 bus cap until at least March 2027, as it gives bus companies and local authorities an element of certainty that they did not have. I note that fare subsidy from Government has been cut as the cap was raised from PS2 to PS3, and I would like to understand from the Minister how the funding links with Government objectives. What is the Government's bus fare strategy? Are they aiming to achieve economic growth, particularly in those towns centres that are failing because the people just cannot get to them to spend their money? Or is this about increased connectivity? Is the bus fare cap policy being used to tackle the cost of living, to increase ridership or to achieve modal shift? We are still waiting for some sense of what the Government are trying to achieve in their bus fare strategy. I am now going to move on to roads. We are still waiting for the list of road investment projects in the third road investment strategy--RIS3. No scheme was published at the spending review. The more recent UK infrastructure 10-year strategy stated: ""A full list of projects will be set out as part of the development of the third Road Investment Strategy."" When will that strategy and that list be published?"
"Mr. Speaker, in relation to the consideration of Government Business No. 1, I move: That the debate not be further adjourned."
"This Government will always have the backs of working people, and I believe there will be a statement shortly on our modern industrial strategy. I know that Ministers from the Department for Business and Trade will be extremely engaged in the point that the right hon. Gentleman has just raised."
"I pay tribute to the work of the hon. Member's constituents. So many of our constituents, including mine in Lincoln, are doing so much to keep these issues in people's minds, and to raise funds. I will not be drawn on what further steps may be taken. We were clear in the leaders' statement that they could include targeted sanctions, so he can assure his constituents that that remains under review."
"Mr. Speaker, public funds must be carefully managed, and taxpayers' money must serve our country, not friends of the Liberals. In Quebec, there is an expression used to describe the abuse of power and the code of silence that protects cronies: “A friend is a friend”. Will the Liberal ministers of the past 10 years vote with us to make GC Strategies pay back the $64 million that it was overpaid?"
"Mr. Speaker, the member opposite talked about consensus. When I read Bill C-5 and then I see what the Prime Minister has said publicly, that each provincial premier will be able to have an effective veto, that to me does not say one national economy. It actually enshrines 13 different economies, based on the preferences of each premier. Can the member opposite simply comment on the consensus part being a complete contradiction to the whole aim of the legislation for one national economy?"
"That is already happening. Non-availability of counsel, whether Crime Prosecution Service or defence counsel, is already one of the main reasons for ineffective trials. I therefore hope we will hear something about that and the Government's plans to alleviate it when the Minister responds. I briefly mention the cyber-attack that the Legal Aid Agency was subject to in April. The attack revealed serious concerns about the robustness of Government-managed digital services and the protection of sensitive data, and holds risks for the day-to-day operation of  the justice system. We need the further statement that the Courts Minister promised on the steps being taken to recover that position--not today, perhaps, but soon--and the Committee will conduct its own inquiry into access to justice, beginning with a call to evidence this summer. I reemphasise the importance of the role the criminal justice system plays in the proper functioning of our society. Out of sight should not be out of mind, in that respect. I appreciate the steps that this Government are taking and the struggle and the tasks that they have going forward. However, there is so much to do that we need to get on with it in a speedy fashion. Finally, let me thank all those who work in the criminal justice system: those who risk their lives and their safety as frontline prison officers and probation officers, and those who keep the system running--judges, barristers and court staff. Across the piece, we see people going above and beyond because of the situation in which the system has been left. I am sure this is one point that will unite both sides of the House: we all appreciate the work that goes on every day to keep people safe and to ensure that justice is done."
"Mr. Speaker, we have already strengthened the EI system. We have committed to giving all of the countertariff revenues to the workers and businesses most affected by the unjustified and unlawful U.S. tariffs."
"The UK has 225 warheads and a number of nuclear-capable submarines that are in a position to fire at any adversary at short notice. We are now investing in aircraft that can deploy nuclear weapons. Given that we are a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty, will that not be seen as an aggravating feature by nations that are also subscribed to it?"
"Oh, oh!"
"I agree with the hon. Gentleman that local communities should have much more control over what happens to the housing stock in their areas. Will he reflect on his party's opposition so far to the proposal from the Liberal Democrats for a different category of planning use for both short-term lets and second homes, given that communities such as mine are ravaged by so many homes being unavailable to local people? Will he change his party's position and show that if the Minister is not listening, he is?"
"(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) Vote #11"
"Mr. Speaker, can the member explain to me why it is that the Conservatives should have any credibility on the issue of seniors when Stephen Harper and Pierre Poilievre tried to raise the age of retirement, of OAS, from 65 to 67?"
"Next week, we have the second day of debate on Report for the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which is important to many of my Exeter constituents. Does the Leader of the House agree with me and with Ruth Fox of the Hansard Society that consideration of the Bill should continue to be thorough and with significant time allocated to the process?"
"Mr. Speaker, 700,000 doses of fentanyl, 32 illegal guns and seven people on bail. These are the statistics from a recent raid just yesterday in York. I commend the police for doing such a good job. I also condemn the Liberals for allowing this sort of crime to flourish in Canada. Indeed, catch-and-release is alive and well in Canada, so why do the Liberals not accept the Conservatives' plan to end catch-and-release so we can crack down on gun and fentanyl traffickers?"
"Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I would like to congratulate you on your new appointment. As someone who did his master's thesis on a very specific thing, which I believe was the Thursday question, you have a love of this place. It is good to see you in that chair. This is an important bill. I think all of us have heard from Canadians during the election that public safety is fundamentally important to them. It is disappointing to hear from some MPs who suggest that other MPs do not care about public safety. One of our fundamental priorities is to ensure the safety and security of our constituents. We may come at it in different ways, but we all fundamentally believe that we need to stand up and protect our constituents. I hope that is the debate we are having and will continue throughout this. It is not what we hear in question period, but oftentimes question period is a little different from what we hear at other times in this place and at committee, where I hope this bill will go very soon. Fundamentally, I believe this bill will keep Canadians safe by ensuring law enforcement will have the right tools to keep our borders secure, to combat transnational organized crime, stop the flow of illegal fentanyl and crack down on money laundering. It will bolster our response to increasingly sophisticated criminal networks and enhance the integrity and fairness of our immigration system, all while protecting the privacy and charter rights of Canadians. Following the introduction of the bill, we heard from the Canadian Police Association, the largest law enforcement advocacy organization in Canada, and the national voice for over 60,000 frontline law enforcement personnel serving across every province and territory. I would like to take a moment and read what it said. It states: ...this proposed legislation would provide critical new tools for law enforcement, border services, and intelligence agencies to address transnational organized crime, auto theft, firearms and drug trafficking, and money laundering. It’s important to emphasize that these are not abstract issues, our members see first-hand that they have real impacts in communities across the country and require a coordinated and modern legislative response. The Bill includes important updates that would strengthen information sharing between federal and local agencies, which is essential to the success of multi-jurisdictional investigations and recognizes the reality that border security is increasingly not the sole responsibility of the RCMP. In many communities located near border crossings, local police services are called upon to play a central role in enforcing our border-related laws. Giving these agencies access to better intelligence and more timely information will significantly improve public safety outcomes. We are also encouraged by measures that would support the work of the Canada Border Services Agency and the Canadian Coast Guard by closing long-standing gaps in inspection and enforcement capacity. These steps, combined with new authorities for front-line law enforcement across the country, would help disrupt criminal operations at key points of entry and within domestic supply and distribution chains. The proposed steps to disrupt the importation of illegal fentanyl and precursor chemicals are also crucial. A faster scheduling process will [also] allow for a more agile response to substances that fuel the opioid crisis and continue to cause immeasurable harm in communities across...[the country]. Bill C-2 would also strengthen the ability of police to investigate and disrupt...criminal networks by enhancing anti-money laundering enforcement, expanding data-sharing with trusted domestic and international partners...[while] improving access to information across jurisdictions. New provisions allowing Canadian law enforcement to share information collected under the Sex Offender Information Registration Act would...[provide] more effective cooperation in cross-border investigations. Additionally, the proposed mechanism to access data held by service providers in other countries acknowledges the reality that modern criminal investigations rarely stop at the border. These updates would help ensure that Canadian police have the tools and intelligence they need to hold offenders accountable, regardless of where they operate. If passed, Bill C-2 would give police services the legal tools needed to respond more effectively to evolving threats. This is the organization advocating for 60,000 frontline police officers. I heard during the campaign, and I hear it a lot during question period, that we need to stand up and give police officers the tools they need. At the same time, I am hearing doubts from the opposition members, who are trying to pour cold water on this. On the one hand, they say that we need to do something, but at the same time they do not want this, even though police support it and it will make communities safer. I do not really understand the rhetoric versus the action, the rhetoric during question period versus the rhetoric we are hearing now. I appreciate the concerns being raised by some members of the opposition, but again, it does not match their rhetoric to get things done in those 30-second sound bites they like during question period. I would also like to add a quote from the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, another great organization: The proposed Bill demonstrates a commitment to modernizing legislation and equipping law enforcement with necessary tools to combat transnational organized crime in an increasingly complex threat environment. In particular, the Bill sets out several important law amendments which will address systemic vulnerabilities within the justice system, providing critical tools for law enforcement, border services and intelligence agencies. Canada’s legislation related to lawful access is significantly outdated and urgently needs to be revised to align with modern technology. Canada lags behind its international law enforcement partners in the ability to lawfully access electronic evidence associated to criminal activity. Transnational organised crime groups are exploiting this gap to victimize our communities across the country through serious crimes such as human, drug and firearm trafficking, auto theft, and violent profit-driven crime. The provisions contained within the Strong Borders Act are an important step in advancing Canadian law enforcement’s ability to effectively combat the ever-evolving nature of transnational organized criminal groups. The chiefs of police have spoken. Frontline officers have spoken. Where is the outcry from the Conservative Party to get this passed as quickly as possible? I hear crickets, which is disappointing. I would like to address a point that just came up, I believe from the member for Kamloops—Thompson—Nicola , with respect to IP addresses. I appreciate the concern when we are dealing with issues like this, but I would like to quote a colleague of his, the member for Parkland , when he was asking questions of the RCMP in regard to this particular issue. He said: Imagine a phone book that has phone numbers listed, but no names. The only names that are listed are the ISPs and the telecom companies that service those phone numbers: the Teluses, the Rogers and the Bells. Police are being told now that they can't even look in the phone book of those IP addresses. They can't even know who the service providers are unless they have a warrant. The effect of this in the past month since this decision came in, according to frontline RCMP officers who are working in the integrated child exploitation units across this country, is that telecommunications companies, in compliance with the Supreme Court of Canada's decision, are now denying this critical information that police are using to track down and prosecute child sex offenders and child predators. The member for Parkland says we need to take action, and I agree with him, but I guess this is the member for Parkland from last Parliament. Where are the members now? Again, I hear it in question period, time after time, day after day. Let us expedite this. Let us move this forward and get it to committee. I can appreciate that there are concerns. I have never seen a government bill in my 10 years that has made it through unamended to the end, but let us ensure that we move this legislation forward so that perhaps the Conservatives' actions will match their rhetoric during question period. I hope we can achieve that."
What steps she is taking to support people on universal credit into work
"Mr. Chair, as I said, my hon. colleague is a very experienced member of this House. I have already answered that question, saying that we have collected $1.7 billion. These sums will be used to support our workers and our industry."
"Mr. Speaker, the reality is that we need to invest more in our Canadian Armed Forces. I have had the opportunity of visiting 12 bases and wings over the course of the last couple of years, and I see what the state of some of our military bases is. We need to make sure that the men and women in uniform have the equipment they need and are able to focus on the job at hand, and to make sure their families are supported as well. With that, we also know there are significant funds we spend on procurement that are going outside the Canadian economy. We are going to focus on supporting the Canadian military industry."
"Mr. Chair, the Prime Minister committed five different times during the campaign to eliminating “all barriers”. These are his words, not mine. I realize there may be some reasons why he cannot, but that is why I never would have made that promise to begin with. Does the minister think the Prime Minister was being disingenuous when he made the promise that we would have free trade in Canada by Canada Day?"
Does my hon. Friend agree that it is not just about thefts from vans? This is about people's whole livelihood and ability to work. Businesses can be struck down. Does he agree that this is therefore worthy of its own offence?
I call the shadow Minister.
"The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right; that is replicated not just in his constituency and mine, but probably in those of everyone here today. Those in rural areas are twice as likely as those in urban areas to depend on their local post office branch for cash and banking services. With 11 banks closing and two banking hubs opening, we depend more than ever on the post office. We have credit unions but what we can do with them is very limited, despite being very welcome. While bank networks decline, the Post Office continues to provide free and convenient access to cash through its branch network. However, the branch in Newtownards in Strangford is set to close--there is potential for that to happen, anyway--and that is absolutely devastating because the range of services that are not available in the local garage, which has a sub-post office, will only grow. Even the Post Office must therefore rethink its obligations. Through the banking framework that the Post Office has with 30 UK banks and building societies, postmasters support over PS3 billion in withdrawals and deposits each month, providing a trusted, convenient face-to-face service at the heart of communities. However, large branches such as the one in Newtownards must be left open if we are truly to have a full service. According to Age UK, 27% of over-65s and 58% of over-85s rely on face-to-face banking. Nearly a third--31%--of people over the age of 65 said they were ""uncomfortable"" with the idea of banking online. The age sector must be protected, and the way to do that is to require legislatively a better minimum service from banks and post offices that are trying to fill the gap but are pulling back. So what do I want? I want banks to be required through legislation that they deliver for their customers. I want to ensure that the post offices, including the main post office, are in place in my constituency and to see opportunities through credit unions. I look to the Minister to outline how the Labour Government will protect access to cash, face-to-face banking and a full-service post office in each area."
"I thank my hon. Friend for raising this important issue, and I know that the fire Minister--the Under-Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham North and Kimberley (Alex Norris)--will be happy to discuss it further. I am committed to ensuring that fire and rescue services across the country have the resources they need to keep communities safe. The deployment of fire engines, though, is decided locally, so this really is a question for Warwickshire county council, which is now led by Reform. The hon. Member for Clacton (Nigel Farage) should have a word with his county councillors in Nuneaton and get them to explain why Reform is cutting fire services."
"Mr. Chair, we might as well be precise. The federal debt, from “The Fiscal Monitor” for April to March—"

"I rise to thank the Government for the emphasis that they have placed on transport and critical national infrastructure in their agenda so far; to urge them to go further; to dangle before them the very exciting prospects offered by my constituency, which has economic potential to unlock; and to draw attention to the unmet needs of my constituents. Along with the rest of south-east England, Surrey Heath is often seen as a well-connected and prosperous part of the country, but that perception has allowed a troubling complacency to take root. Beneath that surface impression lies a set of worsening transport challenges that limit opportunity, stifle growth and place a daily strain on residents across the towns and villages of my constituency. We are the second most car-dependent constituency in the country, with 1.64 cars per household--well above the national average. That figure is the result not of convenience or affluence, but of necessity. Public transport is patchy, unreliable and poorly integrated, and in some areas it is absent altogether. That car dependency comes at a huge financial cost to my constituents and places a huge pressure on our road infrastructure. Junction 3 of the M3 is frequently overwhelmed and is a daily staple of the morning and evening traffic reports. Any listener to LBC or BBC Radio 2 will know the otherwise wonderful village of Lightwater by its association with congestion and long delays. That is terribly unfair, because it is a rather lovely place. The A322, our principal arterial route connecting several villages, is frequently at a standstill. Frustrated drivers bail out and cut through nearby villages such as Windlesham, which is equally lovely, turning residential roads into rat runs. The Lightwater bypass, which is designed to ease traffic flow, regularly grinds to a halt. This issue is not only congestion, but safety and liveability for those communities. Residents  along the A322 report frequent speeding, dangerous driving and noise. There have been serious accidents, some of which have tragically been fatal, but calls for basic safety measures such as speed enforcement remain unanswered."
"I rise today to address the House about a clause that is in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This clause would take away States' rights to make laws or regulate AI for 10 years. I think federalism is something that must always be protected, and I warn against the dangers of protecting a tech industry where we have no idea what the future of this industry will hold. AI is rapidly developing. AI has developed quickly over the past few years. Imagine what it will be 1 year from now, 5 years from now, and 10 years from now. When people look to the future, they cannot take away States' rights to regulate or make laws to protect the people in their State or to regulate businesses that operate in their State. That would be destroying the very foundation of this country, which is federalism. Federal power must always be limited and State power protected. Now, the pushback and the reasons that I have been told about this is that American tech and AI companies must be able to compete with China. Well, American tech and AI companies can compete with China, and they should compete with China. However, don't destroy federalism in order to allow them to do that. That would be a fool's errand. Here is how this can work: Governors and State legislatures can make their States friendly for tech companies in AI, bringing these companies in by making it easy for these companies to operate in their States. That is how it has been done for every single innovation, industry, manufacturing, and all companies across America. You don't destroy federalism for one industry. You protect it and allow States to compete to bring those companies into their States. That is the right way to handle this going forward. Here is a lesson for us all. No matter what political party holds office and is in charge, my colleagues should all watch carefully the bills that are passed and should be mindful about protecting not only State rights but the rights of the American people and looking to the future. When I was a freshman Member of Congress in 2021, I was told that America would be at war with China within 5 years. Well, here we are approaching 5 years later. I don't think America should have to go to war with China. America can beat China economically.  Ask yourself: Why do we send our food to be processed over in China? Why do we rely on China to produce our critical supply chain like medicines? Why would we depend on this country for the American people's supplies, and why would we go to war with them when we can be innovative right here at home, in America, producing critical chain supplies, medicines, and processing our own food? A war is nothing America should ever strive for, look for, or prepare to have to engage in. Americans should conduct ourselves here at home in a way where we don't have to go to war, we don't have to depend on foreign countries, and we never destroy federalism for the future of an industry that we have no idea what it will do. With this warning, I urge all of my colleagues that when the House gets tovote on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act again after it leaves the Senate, that my colleagues make sure that we protect federalism and, at the same time, urge our colleagues in the Senate to pull this clause out of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This bill should be about tax policy, protecting Americans to not have to have a tax increase of over $4.7 trillion. It should be about America-first energy and Americans' border security, not about allowing AI to run rampant and destroying federalism in the process."
"Madam Speaker, these are projects of national significance, so it is important that people who come from other ridings support us in getting these projects done, because it would be impossible to get major infrastructure projects built without the support of Canadians. We now have the support of Canadians. That is important."
I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Donalds).
"Mr. Speaker, the housing minister, who increased building taxes by 141% the last time he had a chance, should be aware that the Oxford Economics global cities index found that residents of Toronto spend more of their income on housing than any other city in the world. However, the man in charge of housing does not think that is a problem. He says that housing prices should not go down, period. If he does not think that housing prices should go down, can he tell the residents of Toronto how much more of their income they are going to have to spend on their homes?"
Prison has two purposes: rehabilitation and punishment. We need offenders to pay back to the communities and individuals they have harmed. I welcome my hon. Friend's actions to punish offenders in the community. Can I give him a list of all the potholes that need filling in Norfolk?
"My community in East Cleveland was once home to the ironstone mines and the steelworks that helped build this great country, but I often speak to steelworkers who say that when they left school they had a guaranteed job for life and this is not the case any more. Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a role for our combined authorities to play not just in creating jobs but in having a skills strategy that guarantees decent, well-paid jobs for our young people years into the future?"
"Mr. Chair, I am glad to hear that. Will the minister commit that the next offshore project will be constructed in Newfoundland?"
"We have the most robust export licensing regime in the world, and I am proud of that. That was a matter that this House voted on just a few years ago under the last Government, and the right hon. Gentleman will know that we made a decision to restrict arms sales to Israel that could be used in Gaza. I also refer him to the statements that I have made about Iran's nuclear intent, the work of the IAEA, the huge global concern and the UN resolution that the UK did so much to secure last Thursday.[Official Report, 19 June 2025; Vol. 1WC.] (Correction)"
"I rise to proudly recognize the class of 2025 enlistees of our armed services who participated in the Our Community Salutes ceremony at Elizabeth City State University. It was a true privilege to meet 27 talented young men and women from northeastern North Carolina and Virginia, all of whom have made the commendable decision to serve our Nation. Our Community Salutes deserves praise for including northeastern North Carolina in their national graduation season tour, and I commend Dr. Ken Hartman for founding this exceptional program.  I extend special thanks to Ryan Bauman for expertly organizing this event, Lieutenant Commander Charles Michael Wise for prayer, and Rear Admiral John Vann of the United States Coast Guard for his motivating words. It was an honor to present each enlistee with a copy of the United States Constitution, an important document they have sworn to uphold."
"I thank my hon. Friend for raising this issue. She is absolutely right: everyone should feel safe while on public transport. That is why we have developed an ambitious programme to help make the transport network safe for women and girls. The British Transport police use overt and covert policing techniques to target offenders who are using the network, promote the reporting of sexual offences, and have committed to tackling violence against women and girls in their 2025-to-27 policing plan, which, with her experience in this area, she may be interested to discuss with them."
"Mr. Speaker, my opinion has not changed in the slightest. A cap-and-trade system is a very good system. Quebec chose that. At the time, we were able to convince our neighbours in Ontario to participate as well. It is, therefore, an excellent system. What we have now, with industrial carbon pricing, is very similar to that system."
I will encourage all members to withhold their comments when they do not have the floor and allow the parliamentary secretary to finish his comments. The hon. parliamentary secretary has the floor.

"My hon. Friend is right to say that this is not just an issue for our high streets, such as those mentioned by our hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Bayswater (Joe Powell), but a concern up and down the country. The National Crime Agency and Home Office colleagues are seeking to take action against illegitimate businesses, and my hon. Friend will recognise that the announcement in yesterday's spending review of additional police officers, with more to come over the spending review period, will help us with that activity."
"moved: That Vote 1, in the amount of $22,077,800, under Office of the Governor General's Secretary — Program expenditures and expenditures incurred for former Governors General, in the Main Estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026, be concurred in."
"every day, our Nation's ICE officers are putting their lives on the line to get criminal illegal aliens out of the communities, and I wanted to see firsthand what they were going through. So this past weekend, I joined a ride-along with ICE agents outside of Nashville. Until you are actually on the ground, you do not appreciate the amount of work that goes into their operations. They are identifying the criminal illegal aliens. They are finding out where they are, and they are figuring out the safest way to surveil them and also to apprehend them. And it is so much more than a full-time job. As I visited with the agents, what I found out is that nearly every one of them is working 75 and 80 hours a week, dealing with some of the worst criminals imaginable. Now, when I joined the agents for the ride-along, they were targeting a criminal illegal alien who had been convicted of child sexual abuse. The agents could see a child on the individual's property, but they could not enter the home because they are not given a warrant. Instead, they have to wait until the criminal comes outside or is in a public space, and then they are able to apprehend him. That is why it is so important that local law enforcement work with our ICE agents. In Democrat cities with sanctuary policies, however, our Federal law enforcement is facing an uphill battle. Recently, amid violent anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles, a mob surrounded ICE agents who had taken an illegal alien into custody. Amid the commotion, a group of men jumped out of a van and grabbed the suspect, helping him flee from the agents. According to recent reports, LAPD refused to send out an alert to track down the vehicle. They didn't want to run afoul of LA's sanctuary city policies. What we also know is these ICE agents nationwide have seen a 500- percent increase in attacks against them. Now, all of this should not be happening in our Nation's cities, which is why Congress should do everything that we can to support the ICE agents and work to make America safe again. My CLEAR Act would ensure that State and local law enforcement officials have the explicit authority to assist the Federal Government in our immigration enforcement efforts, codifying the 287(g) program that is absolutely so critical to local law enforcement. I also introduced legislation that would make it illegal to dox Federal immigration officials who are working to protect our communities. Last month, Nashville's Democratic mayor did exactly that, handing information about Federal law enforcement agents on a silver platter to criminal gangs. Meanwhile, House DemocraticLeader Jeffries said ICE agents should be unmasked ``no matter what it takes, no matter how long it takes.'' This appalling effort from Democrats comes at a time when, as I said, these agents are facing a 500-percent increase in assaults--500 percent. Just last week, a criminal illegal alien in Minnesota used his car to drag an ICE officer 50 yards while that criminal was trying to evade arrest. President Trump and Republicans understand that law enforcement deserves our unwavering support. That is why we are going to do what it takes to help them."
"Mr. Chair, we are having a discussion on the main estimates. Let us talk about—"
What steps she is taking to help improve local bus services.
"Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the police on their good job. I believe there are many problems with the bill, and one of them is that nothing is explained. The Liberals talk about hiring more border guards, but where are they going to get these people? They also talk about hiring 1,000 more RCMP members. If we talk to municipalities across the country, they are waiting for RCMP officers, but there is a lack of people applying for the job. Nobody is applying at Depot. There is a lack of RCMP officers, and they are expensive for communities. I wonder where the Liberal government plans to get 1,000 RCMP officers."
"I am grateful to the hon. Member for his intervention, as I always am, and he is absolutely right that it is necessary to close this particular loophole, and that is the purpose of the Bill. He has raised a very interesting example, and I am grateful to him for saying he is happy for me to come back to him. If he lets me reflect on it further, I will respond to him when I make my concluding remarks at the end of the debate."
"Will the Minister set up a meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to consider creating a trade fair focusing on trade between Northern Ireland businesses and Scottish businesses? That would create networks, would possibly create jobs, and would be great for the economy in both Northern Ireland and Scotland. It would certainly go down well with businesses in North Down and right across the UK."
"The strategic defence review recommended that the Hawk T1 and T2 be replaced with a cost-effective advanced jet trainer. The future platform of the Royal Air Force aerobatic team is being considered at the same time, and a Royal Air Force programme team is being established to deliver that capability."
That issue is still subject to consultation and will be announced by the Home Secretary in the usual way.
"where is Russia? Where is President Putin? I ask that question in light of what has been happening over the past week in Iran. Where is Russia? Where is President Putin? You couldn't find either one of them with a search party. ``Dog the Bounty Hunter,'' all of a sudden, couldn't find President Putin. All of a sudden, even Google can't find Russia. I thought Iran and Russia were peeps. I thought they were best friends. I mean, for decades, Iran and Russia have had a partnership where they have attacked everyone in the freedom-loving West. They are best buds. Now, I know Iran has a relationship with China, but that is more transactional. China just likes to buy Iran's cheap oil. With Russia and Iran, it was supposed to be a deeper, more meaningful relationship. And this isn't something new; this has been a partnership for decades. I remember when Putin invaded Ukraine. One of the first allies he turned to was Iran, and Iran sent Russia ammunition, and Iran sent Russia artillery shells, and Iran sent Russia drones. Iran has sent Russia drones and ammunition and artillery shells every single day of the war. So where is Russia? I mean, it hasn't been a good week for Iran. Where is Russia? On Monday of this week, Iran's top diplomat met with President Putin and asked for help. Do you know what President Putin said he would provide? Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Nada. Some kind of friend. You know, it is not the first time that we have seen President Putin's true colors. It has happened before. You would think that Iran would learn. The month after Iran, through Hamas, attacked Israel back in October of 2023, Iran immediately asked Moscow to supply Iran with-- because Iran knew what was coming, and so did Hamas. They knew retribution was coming from Israel. Iran asked Moscow for jet fighters, for attack helicopters, air defense systems, and training jets, and Iran was sure that their buddy Putin would be there. Putin sent them a few jets and said: Go away. Don't bother me. Then, not long ago, when Israel took out the better part of Iran's air defense system, its golden dome--it wasn't exactly golden. It was more like tin. But the Israelis took it out. Iran asked Russia, said: Look, we have to rearm. We are naked and alone here. We need more air defense missiles to shoot down the Israeli planes. President Putin said: Go away. Don't bother me. What a friend. President Putin has done it to other countries. Russia has had alliances not just with Iran through the years. I will give you a couple of examples. Armenia. Armenia and Russia were best buds, two peas in a pod, but when Armenia got in a war with Azerbaijan, once again, you couldn't find Russia with a search party. Iran and Russia worked together to prop up al-Assad in Syria. Remember that, when the people of Syria were revolting against Assad, who had blood under his fingernails? Do you know who kept him afloat? Iran, yes, but especially Russia. Then Assad got in trouble, and that is when he really needed Russia. He went to Mr. Putin and said: Help me. Help me. Mr. Putin said: No. You are on your own. You can come to my country, where they can't get to you, but that is it. Too bad. I don't need you anymore. A lot is going on with respect to the Middle East right now, but I hope the world knows what kind of friend Russia is. I hope other countries that Russia has alliances with and that Russia is assiduously courting to be a ``partnership'' notice how Russia reacts to their friends. Where is Russia? Where is Putin? All of a sudden, you can't find him. Now, I am delighted with that. I am just delighted. But this was very, very predictable. With friends like Russia--I say this to every country in the world that might be thinking about partnering with Russia--with friends like Russia, who needs enemies?"
"I rise to speak to new clause 59, in my name, which considers the impact of our planning system on our creative and cultural industries and infrastructure. These spaces are the foundation of our world-beating creative industries and are also very important for our local communities. They are the engine of an industry which is growing at twice the rate of the rest of the economy. They are the R&D labs of a sector that is bigger than our automotive, aerospace and life sciences industries combined. Yet the creatives industries are under threat, including from our disruptive planning system and onerous licensing regime. My Culture, Media and Sport Committee has heard that live music venues will be back to shutting at the rate of two a week by the end of the year. That is in addition to electronic music venues and clubs, which have been shutting at the rate of three a week. My amendment seeks to help prevent those closures by putting a duty on planning decision makers to apply the agent of change principles, which have existed since the national planning policy framework in 2018. They require developers to ensure that their developments do not disrupt existing businesses in future, as well as places of worship, schools, transport infrastructure and so on. First, the new clause would be good for venues. Of the 86 grassroots music venues that closed in 2024, one in four shut for operational reasons, including noise abatement orders, neighbour disputes and interventions by the local councils. In the previous Parliament, the Committee I chair held a roundtable in Manchester at the Night and Day Cafe, an iconic venue. We were there to meet representatives of live music venues from across the north, yet the operators could not attend their own roundtable because they were instead attending a court hearing with Manchester city council to settle a three-year noise abatement dispute--a costly and pointless legal dispute at that, as it started due to a single complaint by a tenant who had moved out long before the issue was resolved. Secondly, the new clause would be good for developers and new neighbours. Consistent application of the agent of change principle will de-risk and speed up planning and development. It will ensure that the needs of an existing cultural venue are considered from the start and save developers from late-stage objections and lengthy, expensive legal disputes down the line. It will require developers and decision makers to think about the presence of existing venues and will benefit future tenants and homeowners, who should be less impacted overall. Finally, the new clause would help local authorities. It is councils that have the duties to detect statutory nuisance and investigate noise complaints; it is councils that serve noise abatement orders; and it is councils that get dragged into expensive and often pointless bun fights with local venues, as the Night and Day Cafe example illustrates. Encouraging councils to consider at the planning stage how developers and venues can find a nice equilibrium in their interests can only help to save them time and money, which is surely more efficient than settling matters in court. The new clause has widespread support. It takes forward the recommendation of the CMS Committee in the previous Parliament and is supported by the whole live music sector, from the operators of our smallest clubs, pubs and venues to the biggest arenas and stadiums. It will benefit the breadth of our cultural infrastructure, from our historic theatres to our pulsating nightclubs. It is built on evidence given by LIVE, UK Music Creative UK, the Music Venue Trust, the Night Time Industries Association and the National Arenas Association. The new clause is not about venues versus developers; instead, it is about ensuring we have the balance right between building enough good homes and making sure the places we are building keep the things that make life worth living. Everyone in Westminster and our constituencies agrees that our high streets have been in decline, so it is vital that we protect the places that are  special to us, our constituents and our communities--the places that provide a platform for our creators and our world-beating creative industries, where we can make memories, celebrate and have fun. I hope the Government will support my new clause and, if not today, commit to making this law as soon as possible. Live music is in crisis. The Government need to listen."
"Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for tabling this bill. A similar bill was before the last Parliament, and the Conservatives filibustered the House, preventing it from getting to third reading, prompting the courts to yet again extend another extension to get the law passed so that Canada's immigration Citizenship Act would be charter-compliant. What are the minister's thoughts about the Conservatives' tactics when they first took away lost Canadians' rights to have citizenship passed on to their children, then filibustered it in the last Parliament and are now speaking against it once again?"
"I rise today to recognize an Altoona native, Penn State graduate, and newest Captain of D.C. Fire and EMS, Jordan Wiley. Jordan studied Emergency Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh before receiving his Master of Public Administration from Penn State University. In October of 2014, Jordan joined the D.C. Fire and EMS Department as a Firefighter and Paramedic. In nearly eleven years of service, Jordan was awarded the department's `Paramedic of the Year' award in 2019 and earned promotions to Sergeant in 2020, Lieutenant in 2022, and Captain in 2024. However, the most important milestone for Jordan was when he met his wife Catelyn and started a family with their two children, Russell and Madison. Jordan has dedicated so much of his time, in and out of the firehouse, to serving his fellow community members. As a cancer survivor himself, Jordan is instrumental in efforts to promote cancer awareness and prevention within the department. Cancer-related deaths are rising among firefighters, and Jordan's advocacy will help save lives. Jordan is also an advocate for the National Marrow Donor Program, working to save lives by connecting bone marrow donors with patients who have life-threatening blood disorders such as leukemia, lymphoma, and sickle cell. Jordan has faithfully served his community and fellow Americans for more than a decade, both as a paramedic and as an advocate for cancer patients, and I know his parents, Frank Wiley and Dr. Mary O'Leary Wiley, are incredibly proud of the man and father he has become. Along with everyone in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, I want to congratulate Captain Wiley on his selection to lead the D.C. Fire and EMS Department and thank him for his continued dedication to our fellow Americans."
"Madam Speaker, I want to welcome the hon. member to this place. I know he is a new member and that this is going to be the adventure of a lifetime for him, as it has been for me. Does the hon. member know why, when the government is cancelling the consumer carbon tax for a whole host of reasons, which Conservatives have laid out over the years, it is not removing the industrial carbon tax?"
"Oh, oh!"
The parliamentary secretary will come to order. Both sides will come to order. The rules are being obeyed. There are no pictures to be taken in the House. I have seen no pictures being taken; there are just timers being used. The President of the Treasury Board has the floor.
"Madam Chair, the minister did not actually answer the question. Yes or no, will he order an inquiry?"
"Mr. Speaker, we are here debating a bill today that the Liberals have proposed, which would give endless chain migration, the ability to pass down citizenship ad infinitum, to anybody. We just heard a speech, for those who are tuning in, that shows why this bill is so poorly designed. A member from the Liberal Party stood up and, over and over again in questions and answers, which will be interesting to watch back, did not know how many people this would apply to in the future. At a time in Canadian history when we are talking about what the value of Canadian citizenship should mean, that the Liberal government has proposed such a reckless bill without really thinking through the implications really speaks to the utter disarray and brokenness of a decade of Liberal failure in Canada's immigration system. The consensus on immigration used to be universal. It used to be a non-partisan understanding that immigration was a good thing and that numbers should be set in accordance with Canada's capacity to do things like house newcomers, provide them with jobs, let them start businesses or have health care. Now we know, based on public opinion polling, most Canadians realize the truth: We are in a jobs crisis, we are in a health care crisis, and we are also in a housing crisis. Because the Liberals have increased immigration to such unsustainable levels, they are the ones who broke the consensus on immigration. Instead of fixing those issues, instead of listening to the concerns of Canadians, they tabled an ill-thought-out bill that would enable intergenerational, without limit, chain migration without any consecutive residency requirements, any substantial presence in Canada. That is just so wrong and irresponsible. I am going to tell members what happened with this bill. This is what I suspect happened, because Liberals have come to talk to me privately about how incompetent they think the Liberal immigration minister is. They are shocked, and rightly so, that the Prime Minister would put someone so remarkably incompetent in that role on such an important file. Let me give proof of how incompetent the immigration minister is. She was an immigration minister for eight years in Nova Scotia, and during that period of time, audits showed massive failures in vetting and setting levels and no response to Auditor General recommendations. She even said there should be no limits on immigration into her province. She said it in a CBC interview. She said there should be no limits, no caps. Now the Liberals have put that minister in here, and if anybody has been watching her performance in the House, it has been abysmal. She does not understand basic numbers on how many people are coming in and did not really have a grasp on how many people were leaving the country who were supposed to. Now she has tabled this bill. This is what I think happened. We have an incompetent minister who has to deal with this issue. There was a court ruling that the government chose not to appeal and needed to address somehow. Rather than take an approach proposed by a Conservative member from the other place, which had a tight, narrowly defined solution that would have addressed the court ruling, the Liberals teamed up with a far left, now independent, member of this place to utterly gut that bill and extend Canadian citizenship, turning it almost into a low-grade frequent flyer program. It is basically like someone would need to scan once every five years to get their loyalty program. That is really what this bill is. A competent minister would have taken all stakeholder concerns and said that for the few people to whom the lost Canadian ruling applied, we should have a tight, narrowly defined bill to address it. That is what the minister should have done. She should have listened to the stakeholder feedback and endless debate in the previous immigration committee and fixed the bill such that it could have been something that could be passed through the House. Instead, I do not even think the minister read the bill, to be honest. I think she probably took a memorandum to cabinet with whatever the department gave to her and said, “Just table the same thing.” That is what she did. I bet if we had the ability to question her at length, she could not go through the provisions of this bill. To me, that is not responsible government, given the impact of this bill, so let us talk about what this bill would do, because it is really important for Canadians. With what colleagues opposite in the Liberal Party have been putting up in debate today, we can tell by their answers that they do not understand what the bill does either. They are going to just blindly vote for it without thinking through the enormous, non-partisan concerns that the bill would create for the value of Canadian citizenship. Essentially, the bill would eliminate something called the “first-generation limit”. This was a provision that was put in place by a previous, Conservative government to put restrictions on how Canadian citizenship could be automatically passed down to people who do not live in Canada anymore, for the most part. For colleagues who want a little history lesson, this was precipitated by a situation that happened roughly 15 years ago, during the conflict in Lebanon, when there were what we would refer to as “Canadians of convenience”, or people who had no substantive ties to the country who all of a sudden claimed Canadian citizenship so that the Government of Canada would be obligated to evacuate them. At that time, that initiative, in 2006, cost the Canadian taxpayer almost $100 million, plus endless other ancillary benefits. Most of these people, the vast majority, had no ties to Canada at all. Most of them left and went back almost immediately thereafter. This raised serious questions. It is tough to talk about conflict, but in this place we have to talk about what the obligations of the Government of Canada are to people who do not have substantive ties to Canada and then claim citizenship. To be clear to anybody watching this, I am not talking about the small number of people for whom the first-generation limit that was imposed affected. This is why a Conservative member from the other place did the job of the government for it in the last Parliament and tabled a private member's bill to close that loophole. We support those provisions. It is why a Conservative member from the other place put them forward. However, a now independent member, who lost party status in the last election, worked with the government to completely gut that bill and turn it into a chain migration bill, which is what we have here today, and that is not right. We need to have a conversation in this country about the responsibilities of Canadian citizenship, and the minister started her speech with those words, saying there are rights and responsibilities to Canadian citizenship. However, her speech was entirely about the rights and failed on the responsibilities, and that is why the Liberal approach to immigration has been so broken. Even on a macro level, members will remember the mantra of the last decade: Canada is a postnational state with no identity. Well, if we are a postnational state with no identity, what does Canadian citizenship mean? If we are tabling bills that would allow people with no substantial connection to Canada to, ad nauseam, forever and ever, pass on citizenship with no ties to this country, then that denigrates every person, including people who have immigrated to Canada and become citizens, started businesses here, worked as health care workers, paid taxes and become part of our Canadian pluralism. It denigrates citizenship for us all; it denigrates identity for us all. The beauty of our country, of course, is our pluralism, and it has saddened me as a Canadian to watch people across the country, Liberal, Conservative and NDP alike, lose faith in the value of immigration to Canada. Again, it is because the Liberal government has focused entirely on some sort of false, broken understanding of the rights of Canadian citizenship and has done nothing about the responsibilities. Let us talk about the responsibilities. In the bill, there would be absolutely no requirement for somebody to live in Canada over consecutive days in order to receive Canadian citizenship. Practically, for a person living abroad, the bill would make it so that a great-great-great-great-great-grandma in the future, or somewhere in a person's ancestry chain, somewhere in their family tree, someone had Canadian citizenship, and then, sometime over their entire life period, they would only need to spend slightly over 1,000 days in Canada. It could be over 70 years, it could be over 80 years, but sometime, not consecutively, they just need to spend that amount of time in Canada, and then they would get Canadian citizenship. We have to start talking about the rights that these people would then obtain. Practically, they would be able to get access to the Canadian health care system. Right now, Canada does not have any obligation even for countries that have tax treaties for people to file taxes when they have a citizenship situation like that. I am not talking about double taxation here. They would not have any obligation, in their responsibilities as a Canadian with citizenship, to pay for those services. That is the way the bill is written right now. That is what it functionally means. Part of the problem in this place, sometimes, is that people have to think about what a bill would mean in 10, 15, 20 or 25 years. Let us talk about how many people this could impact. In debate today, over and over, Conservative colleagues brought up the fact that in the last Parliament, for months, we tried to find out how many people this could impact. The now independent member, formerly NDP, lost massively in the last election because of policies like what this bill would support."
"Mr. Speaker, it is true that Canadians need the essential support measures provided by the federal government. Still, we cannot ignore the record of the Conservative Party, which has voted against families in Quebec and Canada at every turn. Take, for example, the Canada child benefit or the Canadian dental care plan, which has saved an average of $900 for each person who has had access. We are talking about 1.9 million Canadians. That is thousands of people in his riding. We could also talk about child care spaces or affordable housing. There are a number of programs. The Conservatives should vote with us to support Canadians."
I have to interrupt the member. I have a point of order from the official opposition deputy whip.
"Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance is part of a consensus within his cabinet to build oil and gas pipelines. The Prime Minister told Canadians that he supported the government's decision not to cancel the approval of northern gateway. Has the Prime Minister changed his mind, and is the Minister of Finance part of a consensus to build oil and gas pipelines?"
"over the Memorial Day recess, Rasmussen found that a majority of Americans say that the country is on the right track. Under President Trump, America keeps winning again and again. Promises made, promises kept. Mr. Speaker, 77 million Americans trusted President Trump to restore common sense to our Nation's Capital by bringing down everyday costs, reining in our Federal spending, lowering taxes, rolling back burdensome regulations, strengthening our Nation's border security, and getting our fiscal house back in order. President Trump has already begun delivering on that mandate, and Congress is helping him to advance this agenda. Just a few days ago here in this Chamber, House Republicans voted to deliver the largest tax cut in American history. We made long-overdue investments in our Nation's border security by funding the completion of the border wall, investing in modern technologies to assist in the interception of drug and human smuggling, and increased detention capacity for Immigration and Customs Enforcement as they work to deport violent criminals and gang members who are in this country illegally.  Our bill supports American farmers, ranchers, and ag producers like those in the Big First District of Kansas who want to see the farm safety net strengthened by expanding crop insurance and updating reference prices. We permanently expanded the death tax exemption, saving 2 million family farms and saving those families more than $10 billion. We supported President Trump and Secretary Duffy's request to make much-needed investments in the Federal Aviation Administration to modernize our air traffic control technology and infrastructure and uphold the gold standard of American aviation. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act strengthens our social safety net while better stewarding the tax dollars of hardworking Americans. Americans are generous people, but we cannot allow the government to abuse that generosity. Programs like Medicaid and SNAP were intended for the most vulnerable populations in our country: pregnant women, single parents with kids too young for school, low-income Americans, disabled individuals, and the elderly. Over the years, these programs have been exploited and expanded beyond their initial intent, causing the cost of these programs to skyrocket exponentially. If taxpaying Americans can get up every day and go to work, why shouldn't we ask the same thing of those who benefit from that generosity. Our bill requires able-bodied adults without kids too young for school to work or volunteer at least 20 hours a week. This includes volunteering at a food pantry, a local church, or giving back to their community. It is disheartening that so many of my Democratic colleagues would prefer to lie about what our bill does and limit Americans to a permanent destination of government assistance rather than empowering them to return to the ladder of opportunity. This is not the American Dream. I am hopeful that the Senate will move quickly to get it over the finish line and onto the President's desk. The country cannot afford to get this bill wrong, and I trust that every single Republican is committed to getting it to the President as soon as possible and helping America win yet again.  {time}  1100 NIH CUTS HARM OUR CONSTITUENTS  (Ms. Dexter of Oregon was recognized to address the House for 5 minutes.)"
"Madam Speaker, the hon. member, whom I welcome to the House, was obviously not here, but perhaps she should talk to her colleagues, who systematically opposed every affordability measure proposed by the government: child care, the Canada child benefit, school nutrition programs, dental care and pharmacare. The party she ran under has systematically resisted and voted against every single affordability measure that would help the very people she claims to represent."
"Is the Minister aware of the concerns about the proposed creative content exchange, which appeared without consultation in the creative industries sector plan? Will he confirm that any AI legislation will not seek to impose a statutory licensing model, but will instead facilitate a market-led, dynamic licensing model based on robust copyright law and enforceable through meaningful transparency?"
"It was reported today that the Treasury may be planning to siphon money off from the water restoration fund for ""unrelated purposes"". What assurance can the Secretary of State provide that money in the restoration fund will be used to clean up our waterways, not to cover rising Government debt interest?"
"The hon. Gentleman will understand that I do not have the details of that specific case, but if he wants to write to me I will happily look into it."
"A two-state solution requires all sides to see it as achievable, desirable and sustainable, so what practical steps have the Government taken with international partners to rebuild and support the Palestinian Authority, and how will they ensure that Hamas have no role in Palestinian governance, as the Minister said in his statement?"
I call the Liberal Democrat spokesperson.
"Sadly, that is not the first time I have heard about such appalling behaviour of attacking and injuring animals using catapults. I will certainly be raising that with my counterparts in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to see what more we can do. I am aware that this issue needs to be looked at, and I thank my hon. Friend for raising it. Amendments 24 to 33 will require operators of collection points for items such as knives and crossbows to carry out the same enhanced age verification checks before handing over knives to the buyer, or in the case of crossbows and crossbow parts, to the buyer or even the hirer of the item. Clause 30 imposes similar requirements on couriers. Clause 128 introduces costs and expenses protections for law enforcement agencies in civil recovery proceedings, under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, in the High Court or the Court of Session in Scotland. As currently drafted, it is not clear how the cost protection measure applies to pre-existing cases, particularly where cases have started before the provision comes into force but costs are incurred after the provision comes into force. As a result, it may be difficult and costly to determine which costs are covered. Amendment 89 provides that cost protections apply to any case where proceedings start after the measure comes into force. Schedule 15 to the Bill introduces reforms to the confiscation regime in England and Wales in respect of the proceeds of crime. Among other things, the reforms make provision for the provisional discharge of confiscation orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, allowing outstanding confiscation orders to be placed in abeyance when there is no realistic prospect of recovery in the immediate term and all enforcement steps have  been exhausted. Amendments to schedule 15 extend the provisional discharge measures to confiscation orders made under legislation predating the 2002 Act. Chapter 1 of part 14 provides for youth diversion orders, which are a new counter-terrorism risk management tool for young people who, on the balance of probabilities, the court assesses to have committed a terrorism offence or an offence with a terrorism connection, or to have engaged in conduct likely to facilitate a terrorism offence, and where the court considers it necessary to make the order for the purposes of protecting the public from terrorism or serious harm. The amendments to clause 139 make a change to the scope of YDOs to ensure that applications can be made for individuals up to and including 21-year-olds. Currently, a court may make a YDO in respect of a person aged 10 to 21, but exclusive of 21-year-olds. Following further engagement with operational partners on the types of cases that could benefit from a YDO, we have concluded that this change would increase the operational utility of the YDO and ensure that it can be considered as an intervention in a wider variety of cases involving young people. Clause 141(2) enables a YDO to include prohibitions or requirements relating to the respondent's possession or use of electronic devices. The amendments to this clause set out a non-exhaustive list of some of the most common or intrusive requirements that may be imposed to support the police's ability to monitor compliance with restrictions on electronic devices, providing a clearer statutory footing for imposing such requirements. For example, it would allow the court to impose a requirement on someone subject to a YDO to enable the police to access their device for the purposes of checking compliance with restrictions such as accessing specific websites or applications. It would allow the police to identify harmful online activity at an earlier stage and intervene before it escalates. As with other YDO measures, the court would need to assess that any monitoring requirements are necessary and proportionate for the purposes of protecting the public from a risk of terrorism or serious harm. Technical amendments are also required to clauses 142 and 150 relating respectively to the definition of ""police detention"" for Scotland and Northern Ireland and to the appeals process in Northern Ireland. The amendments will adapt the relevant provisions for the purposes of the law in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The amendments to clause 151 provide that, where a person ceases to have a reasonable excuse for failing to comply with notification requirements but continues to fail to comply, they commit an offence. The other Government amendments in this group, which make necessary refinements to existing provisions in the Bill, were detailed in the letter that I sent last week to the hon. Member for Stockton West (Matt Vickers), a copy of which has been placed in the Library. With your permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I will therefore seek to respond to the non-Government amendments in this group when winding up. For now, I commend the Government amendments to the House."
"Mr. Chair, does the minister realize that it currently takes about six years to dispose of federal lands to be developed into housing? What does he plan to do to speed that process up?"
"Mr. Chair, if the minister does not know, the officials are sitting there, and he can ask them as well. How much in tariffs will be collected in September?"
"The procurement system that my right hon. Friend inherited from the Conservative party is in chaos, with only two major defence projects out of 49 being delivered on time. What is my right hon. Friend doing to get to grips  with that situation? New technology needs to be delivered on time; otherwise, it risks being outdated by the time it is put into use."
"My hon. Friend will recognise that we, alongside our partners throughout the global community, continue to raise serious issues relating to the plight of Palestinians in Gaza, and of course I will look in detail at the conference to which he has referred."
I call Simon Hoare.
"Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for the question and congratulate her on her election. Canadians elected us with a clear mandate: to be bold and ambitious. That includes the important task of building the economy with the strongest growth in the G7. That is why we are moving forward. This important bill will help build one economy out of the 13 provincial and territorial economies. I hope that the opposition parties will answer Canadians' call and help fast-track this national interest bill."
"Mr. Speaker, I heard my colleague talk about how we all need to work together to build a strong Canada. I think that is what I heard. The points he raised about affordability and housing are strong commitments that we made in our platform. It is because of these commitments that we were elected with a strong mandate. My question for my colleague is this. Does he think his party could stop repeating slogans here in the House and really start working with us? The moment is much bigger than any of us. Canadians expect us to work together. Does my colleague think that we can work together to push ahead with real measures for Canadians and Quebeckers?"
"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am addressing new clause 13, which provides the strict regulation of life-ending substances and self-administering devices. That means there will be transparency about what substances are used and how they are stored, prescribed and delivered. We owe it to patients, clinicians and the public to ensure that every part of the process is governed by clinical standards and ethical safeguards. For those physically unable to swallow or self-ingest, the new clause ensures that devices to support self-administration can be safely used. Without that, we risk creating a system that excludes some of the very people it is meant to support. While we must regulate the system properly, we must also reject amendments that would undermine or stall the Bill's delivery. Amendment 19 proposes adding suicide prevention, the Mental Health Act and deprivation of liberty safeguards to the code of practice. As the Minister who put much of that legislation through, those are really important topics for me, but this is not the legislation to address them. Let us keep the code focused on the Bill's core function of ensuring a safe, consistent and compassionate assisted dying process. Amendment 20 would allow non-adherence to the code to be used in civil or criminal proceedings. That is not appropriate. Guidance is meant to help professionals navigate difficult decisions, not become a legal trap. If clinicians act negligently, existing law already applies. We should not be creating new liabilities for those acting in good faith in very difficult conditions. I also oppose amendments 97 and 27, which would require the MHRA to license drugs specifically for assisted dying and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to recommend them. That would make the Bill unworkable."
"Mr. Speaker, I welcome my colleague to the House. His predecessor, Mr. Lehoux, was a very good member of Parliament. I will work with him to advance agricultural issues in the House. Listening to my colleague's speech, I understood how important the agricultural sector is to Beauce. However, during the election campaign, I was a bit surprised because there was no mention of the importance of supply management in the Conservative platform. There was nothing about the importance of the sector or about concrete initiatives. Will my hon. colleague raise these important issues with Mr. Poilievre and talk to him how important it is for the Conservative Party to make concrete promises for the agricultural sector?"
"Madam Chair, does the minister recall Conservative MPs expressing similar amounts of false outrage about fiscal discipline when the Harper government routinely ran up deficits that ran for nearly a decade?"
I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).
moved: That Bill C-5 be amended by deleting the Schedule.
"The short answer to that question is yes. The Department is contributing to two consultations that will shortly be published by the Business and Energy Departments. They will invite views on the new UK sustainability reporting standards and transition plans. This will help investors, including pension savers and their schemes, to understand the impact of climate and nature on investments."
"I rise today to highlight the national security investments in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, investments that reaffirm President Trump's commitment to peace through strength. This bill delivers $25 billion for the Golden Dome missile defense system, our answer to hypersonic and NextGen threats from adversaries like China and Iran. It expands our naval fleet, restocks our munitions, modernizes our nuclear deterrent, and accelerates the delivery of Next Generation aircraft and autonomous systems. Just as important, it puts our troops first, with $8.5 billion to improve barracks, housing, healthcare, childcare, and career support for military families. At a time when global threats are growing, this bill ensures America leads from a position of strength, not weakness. It is a generational investment in the safety of our country, the security of our allies, and the brave men and women who defend our freedom. Let's get this bill to President Trump's desk."
"Almost PS85,000 was paid out by Dorset Community Foundation through its ""Surviving Winter"" campaign, including to many in my constituency. The foundation has noticed that many more people are relying on oil and liquefied gas, especially those in park homes and rural areas. What is the Minister doing with Cabinet colleagues to push down the price of power for those who do not have a choice?"
"As a person of Gujarati heritage and an MP who represents a large number of Gujarati constituents, I, too, would like to express my shock, horror and sympathies over the devastating news coming out of India. Like the rest of the House, I pray and hope beyond hope for some good news. Recently, I have spoken to many nurseries in my constituency who have served close-knit, hard-working communities for generations, including Shanklin day nursery, Nursery Rhymes and Saffron pre-school. They all tell me that they are struggling and one is to close imminently, due to a combination of rent increases from the council, increases in employer's national insurance, the low rate provided by the Government for free childcare places and their no longer being able to charge for additional services. Will the Leader of the House kindly commit to scheduling a debate on how we can improve funding for our vital nurseries?"
"Madam Speaker, the tax cut would provide about $800 per working couple or family, making homes more affordable for first-time homebuyers, strengthening the economy and lowering the cost of products and services by breaking down barriers across the country and making products more accessible to Canadians. It would also create jobs because of Canadian-made and Canadian-supplied products being more accessible across the country, due to having one Canadian economy as opposed to 13."
"It might astonish the House that I think leadership is about sticking to our principles and values, and listening to ensure that we get things right. I believe that listening is a strength not a weakness, and I believe that in politics as well as in life."
"I was inviting the hon. Lady to withdraw what she and her colleague said about my hon. Friend, because it was incorrect."
"The right hon. Gentleman always asks succinct and clear questions. As he will recall, I was a diplomat for a long time. Sanctions are no remedy; they are an expression of a failure in the international system. As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham Hall Green and Moseley (Tahir Ali) said, we have heard week after week about the agonies. We do go to the conference with a plan, but it is a conference called by our friends and allies, and we are discussing our approach closely with them."
"Madam Speaker, it will be very short, so I will choose the best part of my response for the parliamentary secretary. He is right to say that the Prime Minister is progressive. The parliamentary secretary said ""aggressive"". I, too, find it a bit aggressive to force a vote on a bill in one week without giving the opposition parties the power to properly study and amend the bill to improve it for citizens. That is what we have a problem with."
"I thank the Chancellor of the Exchequer for putting her faith in young people and the future with investments in the AI, nuclear and defence opportunities that young people in Scotland deserve, alongside PS1.2 billion for training and apprenticeships. Meanwhile, in my constituency, Fife college has recently warned about course cuts and campus closures, thanks to the mismanagement of the Scottish budget by the SNP. Does she agree that the best way to get young people the opportunities they deserve in defence, nuclear and other industries is with a Scottish Labour Government and Anas Sarwar as First Minister?"
"I join my hon. Friend in acknowledging Refugee Week. This country will always play our part alongside others to help those fleeing persecution. We have a long-standing history of welcoming refugees, particularly those from Ukraine, as she says, and Hong Kong in recent years. When they are here, they make a valuable contribution to our community."
"With this it will be convenient to discuss the following: Amendment (b) to new clause 13, at end insert-- ""(5A) The Secretary of State may only approve a device under subsection (5) if the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has approved the device for that purpose. (5B) Before making any regulations under this section, the Secretary of State must consult the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency."" This amendment requires that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency be consulted before making regulations and that medical devices can only be approved for self-administration if they have been approved by the MHRA. Amendment (c) to new clause 13, at end insert-- ""(5A) Regulations under subsection (5) must forbid the use of any device used for the self-administration of a gas."" This requires the Secretary of State to forbid the use of medical devices which cause death by the administration of a gas. Amendment (a) to new clause 13, leave out subsection (7). This removes the power to make regulations that may make any provision that could be made by an Act of Parliament (known as Henry VIII power) from this new clause. New clause 14--Prohibition on advertising-- ""(1) The Secretary of State must by regulations make provision prohibiting-- (a) the publication, printing, distribution or designing (anywhere) of advertisements whose purpose or effect is to promote a voluntary assisted dying service; (b) causing the publication, printing, distribution or designing of such advertisements. (2) The regulations may contain exceptions (for example, for the provision of certain information to users or providers of services). (3) Regulations under this section may make any provision that could be made by an Act of Parliament. (4) But regulations under this section-- (a) may not amend this Act, and (b) must provide that any offence created by the regulations is punishable with a fine. (5) In this section ""voluntary assisted dying service"" means-- (a) any service for or in connection with the provision of assistance to a person to end their own life in accordance with this Act, or (b) any other service provided for the purposes of any of sections 5 to 27."" This clause imposes a duty to make regulations prohibiting advertisements to promote services relating to voluntary assisted dying under the Bill. Amendment (b) to new clause 14, in subsection (2), leave out from ""exceptions"" to the end of subsection (3) and insert-- ""( ) for the following-- communication made in reply to a particular request by an individual for information about a voluntary assisted dying service; (b) communication which is-- (i) intended for health professionals or providers of voluntary assisted dying services, and (ii) made in a manner and form unlikely to be seen by potential service users. (3) Regulations under this section may make provision that could be made by an Act of Parliament, but may not amend this Act or the Suicide Act 1961."" This amendment would limit the exceptions that can be created to the advertising ban set out in NC14 and also provides that regulations cannot amend the Suicide Act 1961, which includes the offence of assisting and encouraging suicide. Amendment (a) to new clause 14, leave out subsection (3). This removes the power to make regulations that may make any provision that could be made by an Act of Parliament (known as Henry VIII power) from this new clause. New clause 15--Investigation of deaths etc-- ""(1) In section 1 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (duty to investigate certain deaths), after subsection (7) insert-- ""(7A) In this Chapter a reference to an ""unnatural death"" does not include a death caused by the self-administration by the deceased of an approved substance, within the meaning of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Act 2025, that was provided to the deceased in accordance with that Act."" (2) In section 20 of that Act (medical certificate of cause of death), after subsection (4) insert-- ""(4A) Regulations under subsection (1) may make, in respect of cases where assistance was provided or purportedly provided to the deceased under the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Act 2025-- (a) such provision that is similar to, or that corresponds to, provision mentioned in subsection (1) as the Secretary of State considers appropriate; (b) such further provision as the Secretary of State considers appropriate. (4B) Regulations under subsection (1) must provide that in cases where the cause of death appears, to the best of the knowledge and belief of the person issuing a certificate under the regulations, to be the self-administration by the deceased of an approved substance (within the meaning of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Act 2025) that was provided to the deceased in accordance with that Act, the certificate must-- (a) state the cause of death to be ""assisted death"", and (b) contain a record of the illness or disease which caused the person to be terminally ill within the meaning of that Act."" (3) In Schedule 1 to that Act (suspension of investigations etc), in the definition in paragraph 1(6) of ""homicide offence"", after paragraph (d) insert-- ""(e) an offence under section 31, 32 or 33 of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Act 2025;""."" This new clause provides that references in Chapter 1 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (investigations into deaths) to unnatural deaths do not include deaths caused by self-administration of approved substances provided in accordance with the Bill. It makes offences under clauses 31 to 33 ""homicide offences"" for the purposes of that Act. It also amends the powers in that Act in respect of medical certificates of cause of death. Amendment (a) to new clause 15, in subsection (1), leave out from ""section"" to ""(medical"" in subsection (2) and insert ""20 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009"" This amendment ensures that deaths from assisted dying will still fall within the coroner's duty to investigate deaths under section 1 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. New clause 20--Guidance about operation of Act-- ""(1) The Secretary of State must issue guidance relating to the operation of this Act. (2) The guidance need not (but may) relate to matters about which the Welsh Ministers may issue guidance under subsection (4) (""Welsh devolved matters""). (3) Before issuing guidance under subsection (1), the Secretary of State must consult-- (a) the Chief Medical Officer for England, (b) the Chief Medical Officer for Wales, (c) such persons with learning disabilities and other persons who have protected characteristics as the Secretary of State considers appropriate, (d) such persons appearing to represent providers of health or care services, including providers of palliative or end of life care, as the Secretary of State considers appropriate, (e) if any part of the guidance relates to Welsh devolved matters, the Welsh Ministers, and (f) such other persons as the Secretary of State considers appropriate. (4) The Welsh Ministers may issue guidance relating to the operation of this Act in Wales, but the guidance must only be about matters within devolved competence. (5) For this purpose, a matter is ""within devolved competence"" if provision about it would be within the legislative competence of Senedd Cymru if it were contained in an Act of the Senedd. (6) Before issuing guidance under subsection (4), the Welsh Ministers must consult-- (a) the Chief Medical Officer for Wales, (b) the Secretary of State, (c) such persons with learning disabilities and other persons who have protected characteristics as the Welsh Ministers consider appropriate, (d) such persons appearing to represent providers of health or care services, including providers of palliative or end of life care, as the Welsh Ministers consider appropriate, and (e) such other persons as the Welsh Ministers consider appropriate. (7) When preparing guidance under this section, an appropriate national authority must have regard to the need to provide practical and accessible information, advice and guidance to-- (a) persons (including persons with learning disabilities) requesting or considering requesting assistance to end their own lives; (b) the next of kin and families of such persons; (c) the general public. (8) An appropriate national authority must publish any guidance issued under this section. (9) In this section-- ""appropriate national authority"" means the Secretary of State or the Welsh Ministers; ""protected characteristics"" has the same meaning as in Part 2 of the Equality Act 2010 (see section 4 of that Act)."" This new clause (which is intended to replace clause 37) makes provision about guidance relating to the operation of the Bill. New clause 21--Provision about the Welsh language-- ""(1) In this section ""relevant person"" means a person in Wales who wishes to be provided with assistance to end their own life in accordance with this Act. (2) Subsection (3) applies where the Welsh Ministers make regulations under section 39 (voluntary assisted dying services: Wales). (3) Regulations under that section must make such provision as the Welsh Ministers consider appropriate for the purpose of ensuring that, where a relevant person indicates that they wish to communicate in Welsh, all reasonable steps are taken to secure that-- (a) communications made by a person providing a voluntary assisted dying service to the relevant person are in Welsh, and (b) any report about the first or second assessment of the relevant person is in Welsh. (4) Where a relevant person informs the Commissioner that they wish to communicate in Welsh, the Commissioner must take all reasonable steps to secure that-- (a) communications made by the Commissioner to the relevant person are in Welsh, (b) each member of the panel to which the relevant person's case is referred speaks Welsh, and (c) communications made by that panel to the relevant person are in Welsh, and any certificate of eligibility issued by that panel must be in Welsh. (5) Regulations under section 7, 9, 10, 17 or 26 that specify the form of-- (a) a first or second declaration, (b) a report about the first or second assessment of a person, or (c) a final statement, must make provision for the forms to be in Welsh (as well as in English). (6) Before making regulations in pursuance of subsection (5), the Secretary of State must consult the Welsh Ministers. (7) In this section-- ""panel"" and ""referred"" have the meaning given by paragraph 1 of Schedule 2; ""voluntary assisted dying service"" has the meaning given by section 38."" This new clause (which is intended to replace Clause 47) makes provision about the use of the Welsh language. New clause 4--Monitoring by Chief Medical Officer-- ""(1) The relevant Chief Medical Officer must-- (a) monitor the operation of the Act, including compliance with its provisions and any regulations or code of practice made under it, (b) investigate, and report to the appropriate national authority on, any matter connected with the operation of the Act which the relevant national authority refers to the relevant Chief Medical Officer, and (c) submit an annual report to the appropriate national authority on the operation of the Act.

(3) An annual report must include information about the application of the Act in relation to-- (a) persons who have protected characteristics, and (b) any other description of persons specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State. (4) When preparing an annual report, the relevant Chief Medical Officer must consult-- (a) The Commissioner, and (b) such persons appearing to the relevant Chief Medical Officer to represent the interests of persons who have protected characteristics as the relevant Chief Medical Officer considers appropriate. (5) An appropriate national authority must-- (a) publish any report received under this section, (b) prepare and publish a response to any such report, and (c) lay before Parliament or Senedd Cymru (as the case may be) a copy of the report and response.

"Mr. Speaker, “Canadians will hold account by their experience at the grocery store.” These are the words of the Prime Minister . Single mothers go to the grocery store and walk out with two bags of groceries, enough for two days, and it costs them $100. Now the Liberals are bringing in a half a trillion in new spending, increasing it by 8%, when they had promise to cap it at 2%. Once again, will the Liberals table a spring budget that reduces inflation and cuts taxes so Canadians can afford to feed their families?"
"If my hon. Friend looks at the statistics, he will see that it is usually the better-off in society who choose assisted dying, not the less well-off."
"I could not agree more with my hon. Friend. We need to make sure that we are seeing child poverty fall and seeing extra help for families through free school meals, as well as through the breakfast clubs that she mentions. We also need to see more progress on pensioner poverty. That is why today we are saying that the threshold will be well above the incomes of pensioners who are in poverty. We do not want to see that poverty in the years ahead, which is exactly why we have made this change today."
"Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleague that the budget has to be fiscally responsible as well as socially and economically responsible. There will be a budget in the fall of 2025. Between now and then, we have important questions to settle. One of them is whether the member will support the important investments in the armed forces that we announced just this morning. This is an issue that I look forward to hearing about from the member."
"I rise today to denounce the Trump administration's police state tactics in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, New York City, and so many other cities across the country. We should speak clearly about what is happening. Masked agents of the state in unmarked vehicles are terrorizing communities. They are disappearing people. They are targeting political opponents of the President. They are using militarized force to silence, intimidate, and brutalize not just Americans who are exercising their First Amendment rights but also members of the press. They are partnering with Trump's donors, Silicon Valley oligarchs, for a sinister and deeply un-American agenda of surveillance and criminalization based on people's political views or, in some cases, just based on where they live. There was a story that Trump told during the campaign about the need to restore law and order, about the need to target criminals. Within moments of assuming the Presidency for the second time, though, his true agenda became clear. The administration has no interest whatsoever in targeting criminals. What they want is to fulfill Stephen Miller's white nationalist fantasy. They are targeting law-abiding people.In fact, they are punishing immigrants who are following the law. Let me say that again: They are punishing immigrants who are following the law. That is what it means to use IRS data to target people. It means targeting people who are paying their taxes. That is what it means to send agents, with their faces covered by bandanas, to immigration court to arrest people while leaving their hearings. They are punishing people who are doing things the right way by showing up to court and going through the process. It can be a little easy in politics to point out the hypocrisy on the other side and to point out people's inconsistencies when their own party is in charge. Yet, I can't ignore the irony that the Republican Party has spent my entire life railing about Big Brother when Democrats want to put simple things like energy standards on appliances. For the last 4 years, the majority has gone on and on about the weaponization of the Federal Government. My Republican colleagues created a special subcommittee here in the House, which I happily voted for, to hammer the idea that Americans were being targeted based on their political views.  I wonder, when the Federal Government is sending marines to break up protests in Los Angeles, why are we hearing little from that side about the States' rights. I wonder, when unaccountable rogue agencies are partnering with tech companies like Palantir to surveil and profile Americans, why are we hearing so little from the other side about civil liberties. I also wonder, when people are being arrested, stripped of their green cards, and deported because they do not agree with our government's position on Gaza, why are we hearing so little from that side about the weaponization of the Federal Government. The American people are right to be disturbed by these unmistakably fascist tactics, and they are showing up in numbers to oppose the militarized raids. They are using their constitutional rights to oppose the brutality of Trump and Miller's policies. I stand in solidarity with the people in my district and across this country who are coming out to peacefully make their voices heard and demand respect for our constitutional rights and values. The people who are standing up for their neighbors, standing up for families, and standing up for communities are showing more patriotism and more genuine commitment to our founding ideals than the people running the executive branch. This administration will not last forever, and the reactions of everyday Americans to this authoritarianism give me heart. A couple of weeks ago, after an ICE raid at a pizzeria in Honesdale, Pennsylvania, two people gave quotes to local news that have been making the rounds. One of them said: ``It is just made to instill fear, and I am not sure why we need fear in our communities instead of love and caring and community.'' That is what we are about in this country, and that is what we will continue to stand up for."
"Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, it would be giving Canadians the confidence of an immigration minister who can answer a single question in the House, who knows a single thing about her portfolio or who has even read the bill that she has presented in the House. That would be the first thing to engender confidence in an immigration system that the government has broken over the last 10 years. We used to have the best system in the world. It brought the best and the brightest to the country. That is no longer the case. Members do not have to hear it from me. We could go ask 10 Canadians on the street if they think the system is broken, and they would tell us, 10 out of 10 times, yes."
"work on reconciliation continues apace. We are getting very close to the final bill. Since I spoke on the floor on this topic last week, two more committees have released their sections of the bill text, the Banking Committee under the leadership of Chairman Tim Scott and the Commerce Committee under the leadership of Chairman Ted Cruz. The Commerce Committee text released on Thursday addresses multiple bill priorities, including border security, savings, and the economy. On the economy front, the Commerce section of the bill focuses on boosting growth and investment by renewing spectrum auction authority and freeing up spectrum currently held by Federal Agencies. The United States has been a leader in the next-generation telecommunications services like 5G and advanced Wi-Fi, and we are on track to be a leader in 6G as well. That is going to require both an increase in the amount of spectrum available to the private sector and using that spectrum as efficiently as possible through AI and other technologies. Our bill will help meet that need for spectrum and help produce thousands of new jobs and billions of investment as a result, to say nothing of faster and more affordable internet for Americans. This has been a long time coming. I am grateful to Chairman Cruz and colleagues from the Armed Services and Intel Committees for their continued work to find a way to get this done that preserves key national security interests and delivers a win for the American people. On the border and national security front, the Commerce text addresses a key aspect of our domestic security: a strong Coast Guard. The Coast Guard secures our ports and waterways, provides support to American vessels in need, and plays a crucial role in enforcing maritime and immigration law and conducting drug interdictions. Our final bill will make a substantial and sorely needed investment in the Coast Guard, including funding for desperately needed new ships and aircraft and maintenance of Coast Guard facilities. Along with promoting safety of the seas, the Commerce text focuses on safety in the skies with a significant investment in fixing and updating our air traffic control system. The Commerce text also eliminates wasteful and unnecessary spending, which is the key focus of our bill. So that was Thursday. On Friday, the Banking Committee released its portion of the bill text, and eliminating unnecessary spending took center stage. Chairman Scott and Banking Committee Republicans pored over Federal programs to identify waste, duplication, and inefficiency and identified billions in savings. That includes eliminating the duplicative Office of Financial Research, transferring the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's duties to the Securities and Exchange Commission to reduce duplication and lower costs, and postponing the implementation of duplicative small business lending data reporting requirements. The Banking Committee's text also conserves taxpayer dollars by returning unused and unobligated funds to the Treasury. On the national security front, it authorizes $1 billion for the Defense Production Act to boost domestic production of key national security needs. I am grateful for the hard work of Chairman Scott, Chairman Cruz, and for the hard work of all the members, both on and off the committees, who contributed to the Commerce and Banking text. We have several more committees delivering texts this week, including border security language from the Judiciary Committee and energy language from the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Our final bill is rapidly taking shape. I am looking forward to considering it on the floor in the very near future. Republicans promised to build a stronger, safer, and more prosperous America, and we are going to deliver. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."

"Mr. Speaker, in her speech, my colleague from Côte-Nord—Kawawachikamach—Nitassinan talked about the infamous cheques related to the government scrapping the carbon tax, which were sent out even though no money was collected elsewhere in Canada. These cheques were sent everywhere in Canada except Quebec, even though the government did not collect anything from the rest of Canada. This means that, in the end, money was collected from Quebeckers to hand out to the rest of Canada. Why are Quebeckers treated like second-class citizens in this country?"
"Two of my constituents were recognised in His Majesty the King's birthday honours list at the weekend. Anne MacDougall, for services to volunteering in the community, and James McLaren of Golden Friendships, for services to people with disabilities and older people, received British Empire Medals.

Will she join me in congratulating Anne and Jim?"
"Mr. Speaker, I really appreciated hearing from our member from Saskatchewan. It is really good to have a member of the Liberal Party from Saskatchewan. I grew up in Saskatoon, and I have always joked that I have been one of the only Saskatchewan Liberals in our caucus for the last few years. I am really happy that he is here and talking tonight. We have heard, over many years, about some of the climate-related emergencies we are dealing with, the climate crisis and the forest fires. We have known as Liberals and the government, as we were made aware by Canadians, that we need to do more on that. While on the other side members deny climate change exists and try to blame it on forest management, on this side we know there is a climate crisis that we need to address. I know the member spent a lot of time in the provincial legislature. I wonder if he could talk about the importance of collaboration with all four levels of government, whether federal, provincial, municipal—"
"Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that I have been here for this entire debate, but it is very difficult to get a chance to speak. As he said, there is concern about fossil fuel subsidies. I want to add that, during the election campaign, the Green Party asked the Parliamentary Budget Officer to tell us how much these subsidies amounted to. We wanted to know how much money was being paid to businesses. It is a huge waste of public resources. In fact, most of the companies receiving these subsidies are foreign companies, and they are wealthy. The Parliamentary Budget Officer said that he could not get that answer because of obstacles put up by the Department of Finance. What does my colleague think about the mystery surrounding these subsidies—"
"The CBI says that our net zero economy grew by 9% in 2023, and that it was 40% more productive and wages in the sector were 15% higher than the UK average, so I am pleased to say that this industrial strategy is betting on a winner with clean energy. I am also pleased to hear the announcement that the Government will be slashing the cost of energy for industry, but will the Secretary of State tell me, my constituents in Bournemouth and people across the south-west what the industrial strategy will do for the south-west?"
"The minor injuries unit at Cannock Chase hospital temporarily closed more than five years ago. In August, the Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent integrated care board announced proposals to permanently close our MIU, but it has been radio silence since October. My constituents are having to use unreliable bus services to travel elsewhere, or call an ambulance, which is the opposite of what the  ICB wants to achieve. Will the Leader of the House grant a debate on the importance of urgent care, particularly in more deprived communities, like Cannock Chase?"
Will the hon. Lady give way?
"Mr. Chair, is that up or down from the government's previous projection, and what would the projection be for the budget?"
"Oh, oh!"
I call the shadow Minister.
"Mr. Speaker, mining is crucial to our economy, and with Canada facing American tariffs, we must support mine workers. That is why we will speed up permitting of new mines by cutting red tape and approving projects within two years. This will be in Canada's national interest. This will make Canada stronger. This will make us more sovereign."
"Mr. Chair, I can assure the member that I actually have read the estimates, unlike himself, apparently. The Liberals called small businesses tax cheats. Is this why the government is cheating small businesses of that $108 million?"
"Mr. Speaker, I am a new kid in the chamber. I have only spent the last four decades or so in business in my riding. One of the reasons I decided to run in the last election was the carbon tax. What I find really interesting is that the parliamentary secretary said that business needs to have a carbon tax in order to be competitive. I can tell members that when we are paying 30% of our gas bill in carbon taxes, we are not competitive. When we are trying to be competitive on an international scale, that tax is punitive. I want to know if the member would tell me what the moment was when he had the epiphany, because he stood up for 16 months, as I was campaigning, defending the carbon tax. When did that moment arrive in which he, all of a sudden, decided that we do not need a carbon tax anymore?"
"Madam Chair, the dealers know me well and they appreciate the work that we have done because they know that Quebec is now part of the automotive industry. We are always ready to look at what more we can do together."
"Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent question. I completely agree with the approach being taken now, which will come as no surprise. The context is completely different. We are in the midst of a trade war with the United States. We need to present a carefully considered budget and take the time to implement the necessary measures. We are taking the right approach."
"The east of England will be a clean energy powerhouse for the country. My hon. Friend raises an important issue about workforce, and we will be publishing the workforce plan soon."
"Madam Speaker, before I give my question, I want to put something to rest, I hope once and for all. We have heard the member for Winnipeg North and others repeat the same false narrative about everything being okay that they have not done in the last 10 years because of Harper's cuts. I would like him, the Liberals and everyone in this House to take a look at the public accounts. These are non-partisan numbers put forward by the government. These are real numbers on spending. Adjusted for Liberal inflation, the Liberals are actually spending $200 million less on CBSA than when they took over, so the government should actually end that false narrative, stop misinforming Canadians and actually start spouting the truth about what is going on at the border. I wonder if my colleague could answer this: Why does she think the government is pushing a false narrative instead of answering important questions today on this debate about the border bill?"
"thanks to the leadership of President Trump, America and the world are safer today than we were a week ago. Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, is no longer on the verge of obtaining a nuclear weapon. They have agreed to a ceasefire with Israel. President Trump is fulfilling his campaign promise of promises made, promises kept to make America safe again. America wants peace through strength, and that is what President Trump is committed to. For far too long, administrations in Washington, D.C., have created red lines that were crossed without consequence, agreed to deals with Iran that the regime disregarded, and concerned themselves more with appeasement than with protecting American interests. President Trump took a different approach. For months, President Trump has urged Iran to make a deal. He has been clear. There is no world where Iran, whose leadership chants ``Death to Israel, death to America'' will be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon ever. This is not up for debate. President Trump is restoring America's leadership on the world stage and fighting tirelessly to keep Americans safe, both at home and abroad. This past week, President Trump showed that he is not willing to let America be strung along or taken advantage of. After Iran refused to accept a deal and continued to wreak havoc in the region through its proxy organizations, President Trump carried out targeted, strategic strikes to prevent the pending threat of Iran's nuclear enrichment program.  {time}  1115  He was also clear: Attacks on U.S. Forces will not be tolerated, and there will be grave consequences for such action. This is what leadership looks like, and I applaud President Trump for putting America first. Audrey and I are grateful that our brave servicemen and -women were not harmed in the strikes, and I continue to pray for the safety of our troops and Americans in the region. The world is safer today because of President Trump, and we pray that the Lord would continue to give him wisdom and discernment as he leads our Nation and continues to work on bringing down tensions in the Middle East. God bless President Trump, God bless our troops, and God bless our great country.  One Big, Beautiful Bill's Economic Relief"
"Mr. Chair, the minister told the House in one of the earlier questioning rounds that “it is time to build”. This is what I am wondering: If, in fact, he believes it is time to build, why not have the agency he already owns, which is already building, build more instead of creating more bureaucracy?"
"Mr. Speaker, I would really like to thank the member for asking that very thoughtful question, which goes to the heart of what we are trying to do right now in Parliament. It is why I am really reaching out to the members opposite to see if they can help us with this project. We are just coming out of an election where Canadians were very clear about what they wanted to see and what their concerns are. Let us be clear. Our country is facing unprecedented threats to our sovereignty and our economy from President Trump in the United States with the unjustified tariffs against our industries. What I heard at the door, and I am sure members in all of the seats in this honoured place heard this, was that Canadians want to see us build a strong, unified country to support our sovereignty and to defend our country. They want to see us build to support this country, show pride in this country and do everything we can for a strong future. That is certainly what I heard at the door and what I continue to hear from Canadians as they reach out. Canadians want to see exactly what we saw last week, which was the Prime Minister and the premiers sitting down at a table together to see how they could get things done. We are not going to play partisan politics, and we are not going to play to divisions, because we recognize the moment we are in. The moment we are in is that we must build a strong economy. We must build to protect our sovereignty. At the same time, we need to do that while making sure that we protect our environment, that we keep moving to net zero by 2050, because the other thing I hear is that people care deeply about the future for the next generations. We have an obligation to the next generations, if we are going to say we have a strong, beautiful Canada, to pass on a strong, beautiful Canada to our children and the next generations. The question was a very appropriate one to get to what Canadians are asking of us. They are asking us to build and to build properly."
The hon. member.
"I agree with my hon. Friend's vital contribution. I will come on to a couple of the larger impacts. We often think about small businesses, but we have found from our roundtable that very large companies also suffer a lot of damage. For example, on average Openreach vans are hit three times a day, which delays the fibre rollout in rural communities. Over PS2 million of surveying equipment was stolen from Balfour Beatty's vans in just three months, impacting HS2, which we have discussed today. If any MPs are unsure about the need to act now, they need to speak to Shoaib Awan, Frankie Williams, Sergeant Dave Catlow, PC Dan Austin and the teams at SelectaDNA, Checkatrade and On The Tools, among many others who have worked tirelessly on this issue. I thank them all, especially the Sidcup police team who are leading a lot of that hard work."
"Mr. Speaker, we thank the Auditor General for her work. In a project this big, it is normal for costs to fluctuate over time, especially with all the challenges faced during the pandemic, such as supply chain disruptions and inflation, as many F-35 participating NATO members have actually experienced. National Defence is working hand in hand with industry to make sure we get good value for Canadians. We are making the biggest investment in the Royal Canadian Air Force in over 30 years. This is about giving our aviators the tools they need to keep Canada safe."
Agreed. On division.
"Mr. Chair, in the main estimates, voted authorities are at $222.9 billion and—"
"Madam Chair, the minister mentioned earlier that he has four years' experience with Global Affairs Canada. He was a parliamentarian before he became a minister, and he knows, through his mandate, how important it is to work with all members of this House. The minister was elected under the same mandate that we were all elected under, and the Prime Minister gave him the mandate of creating new trade partners across Canada. How is he going to engage all of us to make sure that we can go back to our ridings and respond to the mandate that we were given by our electors?"
"Mr. Speaker, there is an issue of priorities, and the Prime Minister has been very clear on those priorities. The tax break, for example, will take effect on July 1. However, we have to pass that legislation. We look to the Bloc and other members to get the support to pass that legislation. We have other priority legislation. The government, the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister continue to work on developing a detailed budget that will be presented in the fall. As I indicated, Brian Mulroney took 300 days to present a budget, Stephen Harper took months to present one, and the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, said it would not happen in the first 100 days."
"I have no additional speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time."
"I stand today for the 18th time to demand that the Trump administration restore funding for lifesaving food aid. Edesia Nutrition in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, is one of only two U.S. manufacturers of Plumpy'Nut, a ready-to-use therapeutic food that saves lives every day. This operation includes a supply chain that encompasses American farmers, American distribution companies, and American logistics companies. The Edesia location in Rhode Island in a normal year sources 85 million pounds of raw materials: peanuts, soy, dairy, sugar, and more, all from the United States. That is enough to fill 128 Olympic-sized swimming pools a year. When the Trump administration cuts USAID funding, they are not only hurting children around the world who rely on this nutrition. They are also hurting American farming and manufacturing. The Trump administration needs to deliver on its word to restore this aid. Until they do, I will continue to speak on this floor."
"Mr. Speaker, last night, our Conservative motion passed demanding a budget from the Prime Minister this spring. After a decade of Liberal delay and decline in Northwest Territories, its economy is in trouble. Since 2015, mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction are down 16%, construction is down 43% and the energy sector is down 54%. Economist Graeme Clinton said that as the mines close over the next three to eight years and nothing replaces them, “we can expect a much smaller economy than we have today.” The Northwest Territories cannot afford any more of the Prime Minister 's empty promises. What is his plan?"
